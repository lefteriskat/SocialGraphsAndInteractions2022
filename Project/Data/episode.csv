While driving his newly-built [[Space Cruiser|flying vehicle]], Rick explains that he made a [[neutrino bomb]]: he has decided Earth needs a \""fresh start,\"" and to that end, he wants to destroy humanity, planning to start over with Morty and [[Jessica]] as the new \""Adam and Eve.\"" Morty tries to \""take control of the situation\"" by taking the wheel of the vehicle. Rick eventually decides to land the vehicle, and when he does, he says it was all a test to get Morty to act more assertive. He passes out, and the bomb announces that it is armed and (presumably) activates.\n\nThe next morning, Morty falls asleep at breakfast. His mother [[Beth Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Beth]] is concerned, and Morty's older sister, [[Summer Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Summer]], explains that he was out with grandpa Rick. This causes an argument between [[Jerry Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Jerry]] and his father-in-law. Rick points out that he thinks school is an utter waste of time; before leaving the room, he compliments the breakfast which his daughter Beth made, causing her to cry tears of joy and stop being angry with her father, much to her husband Jerry's annoyance.\n\nAt [[Harry Herpson High School|school]] later that day, [[Mr. Goldenfold]] administers a math test, and Morty falls asleep, sinking into a dream filled with numbers. The dream quickly, however, evolves into a sexual encounter with Jessica, in which she asks him to play with her exposed breasts. Mr. Goldenfold unwittingly finds himself on the receiving end of Morty's subconscious fantasy. Later, Morty is accosted by a bully named [[Frank Palicky|Frank]]; appearing out of nowhere, Rick uses a [[Freeze ray|freeze-ray]] to stop him and convinces Morty to skip History because he needs \""an extra pair of hands\"" in another dimension. Rick and Morty then leave school, leaving Frank frozen and teetering in the hallway. Walking by (and not realizing that he is frozen or just doesn't care), Summer tries to impress Frank, but the front of his foot cracks, and he topples, shattering into pieces on the floor as Summer screams.\n\nOn his lunch break, Jerry visits his wife Beth while she is performing heart surgery to invite her to lunch, but she declines. He then proposes that they should put Rick in a nursing home, eliciting an aggravated response from Beth who lashes out at a nurse.\n\nIn an alleyway, Rick opens a portal in a wall, and Rick and Morty both step into it, emerging onto a hillside in a colorful and oddly-shaped world. Rick tells an awestruck Morty that they are in [[Dimension 35-C]], and explains that he needs [[Mega Seeds|mega-seeds]] from [[Mega Trees|mega-trees]] for his research. When Morty expresses his anxiety about the strange situation, Rick tries to calm Morty down with a speech about facing your fears, but he is suddenly interrupted by a strange arachnid-like beast which chases them as Rick openly proclaims that he has never seen anything like it before and that they are going to die. After escaping the monster and passing by several other monsters, Rick interrupts another set of objections by Morty, directing Morty's attention to a grove of mega trees at the bottom of a steeply walled valley. After refusing to answer Morty as to what the nature of the mega seeds is, Rick gives Morty some [[grappling shoes]] with which to scale the wall. Morty steps over the edge and falls off the cliff, as Rick neglected to tell Morty to turn the shoes on.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry and Beth are still arguing about whether or not to put Rick in a retirement home. Beth is upset, believing that her husband Jerry is trying to rob her of her father, who has only recently moved in with them, while Jerry believes that Rick is a terrible influence on their son Morty and needs to go. After a brief interruption by Beth's assistant, [[Davin]], Beth counters her husband's argument, saying that Morty was having trouble in school before Rick moved in with them; the fact that Morty has a friend is more important to her than any potential detriment. The principal of school, [[Gene Vagina]], calls, asking the couple to come to the school and talk to him.\n\nBack in Dimension 35-C, Morty lies on the ground at the bottom of the cliff, his legs terribly broken in more than three places. As Rick lectures Morty on the folly of failing to turn on the shoes, Morty yells at Rick for his indifference, and for his singular focus on the mega-seeds, rather than his injuries. Rick then leaves Morty, disappearing into a portal for a number of seconds before returning and injecting Morty's legs with a [[Pure Curum|serum]] which cures Morty's broken legs. With his legs fully functional again, Morty uses his grappling shoes to get the mega-fruit, while Rick explains that he traveled to a future dimension in which technology, among other things, has halted the aging process. Unfortunately, he continues, he spent so much time in the alternate dimension that his portal gun has exhausted its charge. As Morty panics, Rick explains that they'll have to go through inter-dimensional customs and that, in order to keep the seeds hidden, Morty will have to smuggle the mega-seeds through customs in his rectum. Morty objects, but Rick persists, as years of smuggling have rendered him unable to do the same.\n\nMeeting with Principal Vagina, Jerry and Beth are informed that their son Morty has attended school for a total of seven hours over a two-month period. In addition, the principal tells them that Rick is the one who has been removing Morty from school.\n\nHaving reached customs, Rick and Morty discover that the insect-like security guards have a new machine that \""detects stuff all the way up [someone's] butt.\"" Rick yells at Morty to run and pushes the guard to the ground, and they both make a break for it as the guards close in on them, passing by various creatures from other dimensions. Rick destroys several things in the customs to slow security down and also assaults two aliens who are bystanders. Using the grappling shoes and other methods of avoidance, the two manage to get to a portal, but Rick has to enter the coordinates of their home dimension. As the guards begin to shoot at them, Rick tells Morty to shoot back at them, telling him that they are robots. When Morty shoots [[Glenn|one of them]], however, he finds that they are not robots but living organisms. Rick explains that he was using a metaphor: the guards are bureaucrats and he does not respect them. During the firefight, a Wilhelm Scream can be heard. Finishing the coordinate input, Rick pulls Morty through the portal into the school cafeteria; Morty lands in front of Jessica, impressing her. Unfortunately, Jerry, Beth, and the principal catch them.\n\nThe spouses start moving Rick's stuff, all of which is in the garage, into a moving van, intending to move him into a nursing home. Rick argues with his daughter and son-in-law, who reveal that Morty has a learning disability. Rick then asks Morty to state the square root of pi and the first law of thermodynamics, both of which he promptly and correctly recites. He explains that having adventures is the best way for Morty to learn, and tells them that, later in his own life, Morty will be doing amazing things as a result of their adventures. husband and wife relent, happy and content that Morty is learning. Rick then tells Morty that none of what he told his parents is true: his super-intelligence is temporary, one of the side effects of the mega-seeds breaking down in his rectal cavity. As the other side effects take hold of Morty, he loses his brain function and control of his motor skills, and Rick starts rambling about the future adventures they will have: \""Rick and Morty, forever and ever, a hundred years, Rick and Morty...\"""

He and Morty then go into the dreams of Morty's math teacher to persuade him to give Morty an \""A\"" in class so Morty can be assigned less homework. They go from Morty's math teacher's dreams to the dreams of a strong black female TV character named [[Mrs. Pancakes]], to a centaur's dreams, and so on. This results in Rick and Morty eventually encountering [[Scary Terry]] (a parody of Freddy Krueger, the villain in ''A Nightmare on Elm Street''). Scary Terry begins chasing the two of them through multiple dreams, causing Rick to become unhinged.\n\nAt one point the two come across a dream of a post-apocalyptic city where they decide to hide from Scary Terry until he gets tired. When Scary Terry eventually sleeps, Rick and Morty enter his dreams and quickly persuade him to help the duo complete their mission. Meanwhile, after watching several exaggerated infomercials on dogs, Snuffles builds an advanced mechanical suit with a translator to speak to humans. He assembles a robot dog army and proceeds to take over the human race. Rick finds Morty and gives him pills which will make his kidneys shut down.\n\nMorty is later seen lying down on a hospital bed in a critical state with Snuffles by his side trying to keep him alive. Snuffles awakens (the aforementioned scenario is revealed to be a dream) and realizes that colonizing earth isn't the answer and that dog-kind must not fall to the fate of humankind with its heartbreak and cruelty. Snuffles and Morty have a tearful goodbye as Snuffles leaves for another planet for intelligent dogs where compassion is exercised and \""pet insurance is mandatory.\""\n\nAfter the credits, Rick and Scary Terry are shown in Scary Class, now being taught by Scary Mr. Johnson, who asks to be called Scary Glen. Instead of Fundamentals of Fear, Scary Glen tells his students they first need to learn \""how to chill.\"""

[[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] then shows up with a homeless man in a Santa outfit he briefly introduces as [[Ruben]] before heading into the garage.\n\nAs the holiday progresses, Jerry realizes that his traditional idea of a family Christmas has been usurped by the introduction of [[Jacob]], his mother's lover, who has entered a three-way relationship with his parents. While the rest of the family accepts and supports the relationship, Jerry becomes insecure and defensive, allowing his anxiety over his parents' relationship to negatively affect him throughout the episode.\n\nMeanwhile, Morty finds out that Rick has created a Jurassic Park-style amusement park inside Ruben the homeless man, and that he is needed inside Ruben's body. Rick shrinks him down to microscopic size and injects him into Ruben's chest cavity, allowing him to meet [[Dr. Xenon Bloom]] and the other residents of Anatomy Park. Ruben soon dies from a multitude of bacteria and viruses that have run rampant through his body, and the crew has to escape it to survive. As they make their way through [[Anatomy Park (Location)|Anatomy Park]], Morty begins to fall for [[Annie]], an employee of Anatomy Park, who begins the journey apathetic of his plight but who soon grows to fancy him. The crew discovers that [[Poncho]] had planned to compromise the safety of Anatomy Park, to get back at Dr. Bloom, but he falls to his death trying to fight off the [[Bubonic Plague|bubonic plague]], with Roger drowning in shit soon after. \n\nMeanwhile, Summer's boyfriend [[Ethan]] barges into the house asking why she has been ignoring all his texts, which leads to an argument. Jacob manages to bring Ethan to confess the source of his anger. \n\nBack in the body, Dr. Bloom, Annie, and Morty sit in a room watching an animatronic Reuben explain his history. The body soon begins to collapse and the crew has to try and ride a skeletal railway system (or, \""The Bone Train\"") out to Reuben's nipple. Dr. Bloom is eaten alive by [[E. coli]] while trying to operate the bone train, whilst Morty and Annie are almost eaten by [[Hepatitis A]], but [[Hepatitis C]] comes to their rescue. \n\nRick lin the meanwhile has put Reuben's body into his ship and flown him and miniature Morty and crew out into space. He activates a growth ray on the corpse, leading to nationwide panic over the \""naked sky Santa\"". The body soon explodes via dynamite Rick put in while picking up Morty and Annie, raining bloody chunks all over America and the Smith household. \n\nRick, Morty, and Annie arrive back at the house, where Annie reveals that she's been studying Dr. Bloom's work and has the knowledge capable to build a new one. Rick shrinks her back down, leaving Morty depressed. \n\nIn the after-credits scene, Rick talks to Annie on speakerphone, where the new crew reveals plans to scrap Rick's special ride, \""Pirates of the Pancreas.\"" He hangs up on them and rants to Ethan, the site of the new Anatomy Park, about compromise.

[[Morty Smith|Morty]] stops in to comment on the beautiful day before a robotic [[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth]] gets into a car and leaves for work. Rick is shown acting suspicious of the day's events, as well as Morty. Morty leaves for school and is called up to the front of the \""math class\"" by [[Mr. Goldenfold]], who asks him to teach the class, despite Morty's seemingly incorrect answer to a math question. A classmate asks Morty to share the recipe for [[concentrated dark matter]], and a reluctant Morty is nearly enticed by [[Jessica]] into doing so before Rick bursts in and pulls Morty away.\n\nRick tells Morty to get naked as they scramble into some locker room showers. Rick explains that they are actually trapped in a simulation of real-life by a race of 'intergalactic scammers' called [[Zigerions]]. Rick tells Morty that they'll be safe if they're naked, as the alien race is immensely uncomfortable with the sight of nudity.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry]] has accidentally been abducted into the simulation too, and calmly goes about the day's events without noticing the numerous glitches, as his simulation is made to run on very low capacity. Jerry drives to work and gives a pitch for a marketing slogan for apples ('Hungry for Apples?'), which the board members approve. Jerry is filled with unbound confidence and promptly leaves to make love to the simulated Beth.\n\nRick and Morty plan an impromptu rap concert, and Rick orders the crowd to perform a wide variety of actions in order to saturate the RAM and freeze the CPU, thus, the simulation. The duo manages to escape from the simulation, sneak into the ship, steal some Crystallized Core Processing Units and proceed to an escape pod. As they fly back to Earth and return to the garage, Rick's enters the passcode to a hidden safe, which refuses to open. The garage then melts away, proving that they are still trapped in the simulation.\n\n[[Prince Nebulon]] appears and taunts Rick for thinking he escaped, revealing that the Zigerions have always had the recipe for concentrated dark matter, but Rick pulls Morty's pants down to cause a diversion, leading to a chase throughout the ship. Back in the simulation, Jerry returns to work in order to confess his slogan is a rip-off of 'Got Milk?', but his boss is caught in an infinite loop of snapping his fingers and saying \""Yes!\"". In the span of a minute Jerry is fired, rehired, promoted, and then nominated for an 'Appley Award' (a fictional award that Jerry made up just seconds earlier). Jerry wins the award, and gives a heartfelt speech about how that day was the best day of his life, before the simulation crashes.\n\nRick and Morty reunite with Jerry as they attempt to find a real escape pod to use. They climb into one but are promptly pursued by Zigerion ships, and Rick decides to put together some concentrated dark matter to escape. Morty asks for the recipe, and Rick orders Morty to mix 2 parts cesium, 1 part plutonic quartz, and an entire (12oz/355mL) bottled water to create the concentrated dark matter. But then, Morty freezes with he and the ship fading away, proving that it was just Rick and Jerry in the simulation all along. Prince Nebulon reappears victorious and allows them to leave.\n\nWhile throwing a victory celebration, the Zigerions mix the listed components to make the dark matter, but their ship promptly explodes, proving that Rick knew he was in a simulation since at least the time he was tricked into entering the safe combination. Rick sings the saxophone part to Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty as their shuttle flies away.\n\nIn a post-credits sequence, Jerry gives the 'Hungry for Apples?' pitch at an actual board meeting and is fired on the spot. A drunken Rick approaches the real Morty in bed, pulling a knife on him and yelling at him, calling him a \""little bitch\"" repeatedly, to prove he's not a simulation before passing out asleep."

[[Rick]] pleads for him to continue being his sidekick, but allows him to lead his own adventure. The two strike a bet with each other:\u00a0if the trip is a success then Morty will get to lead every tenth adventure, if the trip is a failure Morty will no longer complain.\nThe rest of the Smith family bugs Rick for a solution to several mundane problems. Rick gives the family the [[Meeseeks Box]], a gadget capable of instantaneously summoning helpers named [[Mr. Meeseeks]]. These blue creatures exist only to solve the task at hand. Once their task is solved, the creatures instantly disappear from existence. Rick assures the family that the creatures are happy to die, and warns them to keep their tasks simple. When Rick and Morty leave, Beth asks her Meeseeks to help her become a more complete woman while Summer wants hers to make her more popular at school. Jerry put out their apparently difficult requests, asks his Meeseeks to do something comparatively simple sounding and help knock two strokes off his golf game.\n\nMorty leads Rick on an adventure through a fantasy world. They stop at a poor village that requests the help of two heroes to help raise money for them. The villagers point towards the sky, where a world of Giants awaits. Morty and Rick climb up a giant plant stalk to the Giant's world and wait on the giant's table for him to emerge. A giant named [[Dale]], appears smelling Rick and Morty and is about to start looking for them (with the intention of eating them) when he suddenly slips over and bangs his head on the corner of the table, killing himself. Dale's wife, [[Rose]], and their son walk in and see the scene, and Rick and Morty are quickly arrested for Dale's \""murder\"".\n\nSummer's Meeseeks quickly makes her more popular at school by giving an inspiring speech that wins her a lot of friends, while Beth's takes her on a date and gives her some encouraging advice. However, Jerry struggles to improve at golf despite the coaching from his Meeseeks. Jerry is ready to give up, but his Meeseeks can't stop existing until it completes its task and decides to summon another Meeseeks to help. It isn't long before Jerry is surrounded by several Meeseeks all desperate to get Jerry to improve since many of them haven't had to exist that long, which leads to the Meeseeks slowly losing sanity as their task fails to be completed. Soon, there are dozens of Meeseeks created but Jerry still isn't improving making everyone involved frustrated. An exasperated Beth heads to dinner and Jerry goes along, telling the complaining Meeseeks that his golf game is more their concern than his. After they've gone, all the Meeseeks blame each other for their predicament and argue over the correct solution soon descending into a massive brawl, tearing each other apart (which ''still ''doesn't kill them) while creating more and more Meeseeks to join in the fight. Eventually, the original Meeseeks, having been alive for over two days (an eternity in Meeseeks time), tells his fellows that he has a solution to permanently take all strokes off Jerry's game, by killing him.\n\nRick and Morty are tried in a Giant's Court but are let go thanks to a technicality. Rick tries to convince Morty to throw in the towel, but he refuses. As the duo climb down several of the Courthouse's giant stairs, they find a tavern called the [[Thirsty Step]]. Morty, still bounding with confidence about the success of his adventure, confronts Rick about his constant negative attitude before going to the bathroom. While washing his hands, he runs into [[Mr. Jellybean]]. Mr. Jellybean asks Morty about his adventure and Morty tells him that he's nervous that it might have gotten out of hand. When Mr. Jellybean points out that adventures are supposed to be full of surprises Morty cheers up and decides to \""go with the flow.\"" However, Mr. Jellybean then wraps his arms around Morty and asks him to stay and \""go with the flow.\"" Understandably unsettled by this impulsive tact Morty tries to leave before Mr. Jellybean shoves him against the sinks. Realizing that Mr. Jellybean's attempting to rape him Morty starts to panic. Unfortunately, no one can hear his screams as Rick is singing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \""Sweet Home Alabama\"" on the karaoke machine. Morty is force into one of the stalls but fortunately manages to fend Mr. Jellybean off, although he is visibly shaken afterward. Morty emerges from the bathroom and finds Rick playing cards. Rick apologizes for his previous negative attitude and tells Morty that he's having a good time as he had just won a lot of money in several games of cards. Morty on the other hand is trembling terribly and tells Rick that the adventure's over and they should just leave. Confused, Rick tells Morty that he's in the middle of a game at which point Morty tearfully breaks down and tells Rick that he'll accept losing the bet and begs Rick to take them back home. Rick pieces together what happened when he notices a bruised Mr. Jellybean leaving the bathroom and persuades Morty to get a ride down to the village and share his winnings with the townspeople. Morty cheers up, and the two leave.\n\nBeth and Jerry go out to dinner, and the horde of Mr. Meeseeks descend on the restaurant wielding various weapons. Jerry and Beth escape into the restaurant's freezer, and the Mr. Meeseeks began taking hostages to coerce Jerry to come out. Jerry almost gives in, but Beth encourages him to try his golf swing one last time. Jerry emerges from the freezer and uses a severed pipe and tomato to prove that his swing has improved. The Mr. Meeseeks celebrate and disappear, all except for one 'stickler' Mr. Meeseeks who takes a hostage and asks to see Jerry's short game. Jerry hits an onion into a coffee cup, which finally dispatches all of the Mr. Meeseeks.\n\nAfter sharing their remaining money with the villages, Rick congratulates Morty on a successful adventure and agrees that Morty has won the bet. The villagers then ask Rick and Morty to meet their king, who turns out to be Mr. Jellybean. Morty quickly declines and Rick opens the portal to home. The duo quickly hop through the portal and leave as quickly as possible. However, not content with allowing Mr. Jellybean to get away with his attempted rape, Rick quickly re-opens the portal and his hand emerges from the portal with a laser gun, which he uses to shoot and kill Mr. Jellybean, much to the horror of the villagers.\n\nThe trauma of the restaurant incident helps patch together Jerry and Beth's relationship for the time being.\n\nIn an after-credits scene, one of the villagers is sadly looking at the memorial statute made in honor of Mr. Jellybean when his squire arrives with shoe-box filled with photographs, clearly frazzled by something. He tells the villager that the box had been found in a locked chest in the closet of Mr. Jellybeans estate. The villager looks at the photographs and gags at the horrifying discovery. His squire suggests that they tell the people, but the villager orders him to burn it instead, claiming that the villagers would be better off remembering Mr. Jellybean for the idea that he represented to them rather than for his true disgusting nature. The episode ends with a shot of his (rather suggestive) statue of his with his arms around a child in his underwear."

With the annual Flu Season Dance coming up, Morty talks to [[Jerry]] about his issue. Jerry compares Morty's fondness for Jessica to his own fondness for [[Beth]] when he was a teenager. [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] overhears Jerry's story and reminds him that said fondness resulted in Jerry getting Beth pregnant at 17. Rick proceeds to warn Morty not to go to Jerry for romantic advice because, \""his marriage is hanging on by a thread\"". An insulted Jerry remarks that there isn't a problem with his marriage. Unconvinced, Rick tells Jerry that he can believe what he wants but it's pretty obvious that Beth is looking for an excuse to leave him. Morty becomes upset and asks Rick not to talk about his parents in that fashion. In response, Rick tells Morty that what people interpret as, \""love\"" is just a chemical that causes animals to breed and once that has happened, any true passion fades away. After Rick leaves, a depressed Morty goes upstairs to prepare for the dance and a nervous Jerry goes to check on Beth. Thinking about what Rick told him, Morty approaches Rick and requests a potion that can make Jessica like him. After a brief argument, Rick calls Morty a, \""thorn in his ass\"" and gives Morty a serum based off the genetic makeup of voles, a rodent that pair bonds with its mate for life. Before leaving, Morty asks if there's anything that could go wrong with the serum and Rick answers no. Once Morty has left, however, Rick quickly adds, \""unless she has the flu\"", but shrugs it off.\n\nAt the dance, Morty uses the serum on Jessica, and, save for her dilated pupils, it seems to be a success. When Brad sees Jessica holding Morty, he becomes angry and tries to wrestle him away from her. Things only get worse when Jessica begins to sneeze. The serum, which has piggy-backed onto the flu virus and has caused the virus to replicate in seconds, is seen to go airborne, infects Brad with the serum. Brad quickly apologizes to Morty but begins to make sexual advances on Morty which leads to another scuffle between Jessica and Brad. Eventually [[Principal Vagina]] leads Brad away, while Brad sneezes causing the serum laced flu virus to enter the fruit punch and air vents. Soon everyone at the dance is infected with the flu and subsequently the serum. Morty prays that everything go according to plan, when Jessica starts aggressively telling Morty to have sex with her on the spot, in front of the entire school. Morty is unsurprisingly mortified and Jessica's friend tells her to control herself, before she begins to make advances on Morty as well. Morty slowly backs up and notices that everyone in the room now has dilated pupils and they're all looking at him lustfully. Realizing what has happened with dread, Morty feebly whimpers, \""Oh, crap!\"". The students and faculty swarm around Morty, with each of them violently competing to have Morty for themselves. Morty eventually manages to get away from everyone and makes a break for the exit where Rick is waiting for him. Rick tells Morty that he realized that he messed up and explains how this all happened. Terrified, Morty asks Rick what they're going to do and Rick tells him that he's already whipped up an antidote using praying mantis DNA as the base, claiming that they're the, \""opposite of voles\"" due to their nature to only mate once before the female devours the male.  \n\nRick releases his antidote along with a second, more powerful airborne virus. Upon releasing the new airborne serum, Rick tells Morty that the serum doesn't affect anyone related to Morty by blood so luckily it means none of his family will want to have sex with him. For a moment, the antidote appears to have been successful, until everybody starts growing mantis-like features and other appendages. Now not only do they still wish to copulate with Morty but also have the urge to behead and eat him afterward. This Mantis-love virus soon infects the entire Earth population, all of which not only wish to mate with Morty but consume him afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry approaches Beth and asks her if she still loves him. Beth tells Jerry that loving him is the equivalent of building a homeless shelter, work that nobody wants to do but people who care will do so anyway. She then is called in to work late to help out with some horses after an incident at the racetrack and Jerry begins to suspect she may be having an affair. Despite [[Summer Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Summer]]'s warnings, Jerry decides to stop by [[St. Equis Hospital]] where his wife works. On the way, he encounters a massive roadblock on the highway and is confronted by several mutated victims. Finding a shotgun in an abandoned police car, Jerry arms himself and shoots his way through the horde. After a successful surgery, Beth's coworker [[Davin]] makes a move before being infected by the Mantis-love virus. Just then, Jerry, in tattered clothes, busts in with a crowbar and beats him to death. Meanwhile, Rick and Morty travel to a secluded area in the desert. While Rick tries to concoct a third serum to undo all of his previous work Morty is watching the news and is horrified to find that the virus has spread across the entire planet. Rick then claims that he has created the solution by taking the DNA from several sources, including koala, rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, golden retriever, shark, and dinosaur. Morty is confused by Rick's concoction and asks how it would put people back to normal, but only gets chastised by Rick for questioning him. As they fly over the town, Rick tries to build up hype so he can rub his supposed success in Morty's face, until Morty finally just grows tired of Rick's arrogance and releases the third airborne virus himself. At first the serum seems to have worked, as some people are returned to normal, but just as quickly, people begin turning into disfigured, humanoid blobs that Rick dubs \""[[Cronenbergs]].\"" Rick then sarcastically says, \""You're welcome.\"" to Morty, claiming that he made him the, \""mayor of, 'I told you so town'\"". The world is soon overrun with these disfigured monsters, and Jerry and Beth fight their way through them to survive, eventually reuniting with Summer.\n\nAs dawn breaks, Rick and Morty sit upon a rooftop overlooking the chaos around them. Rick tries to be light-hearted and jokingly points out that no one wants to have sex with Morty any more so they must be going in the right direction. Morty, on the other hand, is still absolutely horrified by the fact that the world was in ruin and asks Rick how he could have been so irresponsible. Not willing to take the blame, Rick reminds Morty that he was the one who asked for the serum to begin with, and claimed that Morty was a total creep. Morty accepts his responsibility for the disaster but he quickly reminds Rick that he was the one who botched the original serum, mixed a bunch of random genes together, hoped for the best and ended up turning the entire world population into Cronenbergs. \n\nFurthermore, Morty declares that Rick had to figure out a way to fix everything. At wits end for what to do, Rick then ultimately decides to use his final emergency solution. The scene cuts to Rick and Morty's garage, with Morty congratulating Rick on saving the world from the Cronenbergs. Rick asks Morty for his screwdriver, and gladly begins to finish his invention from earlier. Just as Rick twists the screw the third time, the device violently explodes, instantly (and messily) killing Rick and Morty. The Rick and Morty from the rooftop scene then step out from a portal, and Morty panics at the sight of incredibly bloody garage with the corpses of him and his grandfather lying limp and burnt on ground; until Rick calms him down by telling Morty that there are an infinite number of realities and in a few of them he managed to save the world from the viruses. Rick further explains the he just had to find one of those realities in which they died soon afterwards so that they could come in and take their place.\n<nowiki> </nowiki>A still horrified Morty asks Rick what was going to happen to the world they left behind only for Rick to tell him there's nothing they can do, so they shouldn't think about it. Rick further remarks that Morty should be glad that he messed as much as he did because if he hadn't, they would have been the versions of themselves that died in an explosion. The episode ends with Rick and Morty, burying their dead bodies in the backyard. Upon finishing, Morty, with a [[Wikipedia:Thousand-yard stare|thousand-yard stare]], returns into the house in a daze, looks around at his new home and sits on the couch, clearly shell-shocked by all that has happened.\n\nAfter the credits, the remainder of the Smith family of the Cronenberged dimension is shown living out of a van fitted with armor and survival equipment and roasting a dead Cronenberg over a fire. Summer creates her own TV shows standing in a cardboard box while her parents, Jerry and Beth, admit they don't miss Rick and Morty at all and despite the world falling apart, they have actually found happiness. Meanwhile, [[Cronenberg Rick]] and [[Cronenberg Morty]] transport from a reality they call [[Cronenberg World]] in which Cronenberg Rick accidentally turned everyone into normal human beings."
Raising Gazorpazorp,1,7,Raising_Gazorpazorp,https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&titles=Raising_Gazorpazorp&format=json,1_7_Raising Gazorpazorp.txt,"[['Morty'], ['Rick'], ['Summer'], ['Jerry'], ['Beth'], ['Morty Jr'], ['MarSha'], ['Gwendolyn'], ['Pawnshop Clerk'], ['Brad Anderson']]","While Rick haggles with the owner of an intergalactic pawn shop, Morty spots a sex robot at the back of the shop and asks if he can have it, saying that it \""looks cool\"" and claiming that he needs a souvenir from his adventures with Rick in case his grandfather ever passes away. Dismissively, Rick concedes.\n\nBack on Earth, the rest of Morty's family is perturbed with his newly sexually active lifestyle with the robot, with Jerry particularly vocal against it since all Morty does is stay in his room with the robot. Beth points out that Morty is undergoing puberty and insists that Jerry not intervene, though remains cautiously open to the idea when Morty calls for Rick's help and her father goes upstairs.\n\nMorty reveals a floating metal ball which he claims is \""Gwendolyn\"" the robot. The rest of the family, alerted by the commotion from Rick trying to secure the ball, witness the metal ball give birth to a infant and turn back into the robot. Inspecting the robot's insides, Rick confirms that the robot was given the ability to give birth and the infant contains half of Morty's DNA, to the shock of Morty and the family. Before he can put down the alien infant, he is stopped by the rest of the family who ask him to let it live, despite his protests. Rick decides to take the robot to the garage and inspect it further while Morty is determined to raise \""Morty Jr.\"" as his own.\n\nAs Summer visits the garage, Rick identifies the robot's origin as the planet Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system, and explains that he intends to send Morty Jr. back to his home planet and find suitable parents for him. Summer hints that she wishes to go an adventure with her grandfather like Morty does, but Rick dismisses her, claiming that he doesn't take \""chicks\"" on adventures, which offends Summer. Summer is suddenly seized through the portal Rick opens by male Gazorpians, forcing Rick to follow. Meanwhile, Jerry and Beth both attempt to give Morty parenting advice, but end up disagreeing with their different parenting styles, alluding to their own disappointments with their children. Morty snaps, demanding his parents to back off, instead turning on the television to show Morty Jr. a children's show; both Jerry and Beth agree that Morty will inevitably fail with his parenting.\n\nOn Gazorpazorp, Summer is nearly raped by the male Gazorpians until Rick rescues her in time, but the resulting fight destroys his portal gun. Rick attempts repairs on the gun with parts from broken sex robots littered on the planet while Summer is forced to conceal herself in a burqa, disgusted at the backwards, patriarchal state of the planet. She is offended by Rick's suggestion that the male Gazorpians removed their females for efficiency due to their advancement and eventually caused a fallout that knocked them back to their \""Stone Age\"". Just then, a gigantic floating stone head arrives above the male Gazorpians to drop more sex robots, which the males copulate with. Rick and Summer grapple onto one of the robots and enter the stone head, which is revealed to be run by refined female Gazorpians who profess severe distaste for males, forcing Summer and Rick to fake a master-slave relationship.\n\nThe female Gazorpians bring Rick and Summer to their underground matriachal utopia, bringing them before their leader Ma-Sha. Ma-Sha reveals that the female Gazorpians chose to separate themselves from the males. To continue their species they created the sex robots and separate the resulting babies by gender; the little girls are educated into their society while the children are evicted onto the planet's surface. When Summer exclaims about the infants being just children, Ma-Sha tells her that Gazorpian males mature within a day and become one of the most violent, aggressive species in the universe. Rick realizes that Morty is in big trouble, as is Earth. Indeed, as Morty Jr. matures from infancy to childhood, Morty is horrified as Morty Jr. expresses desire to cause destruction, murder and mayhem, and insists on keeping Morty Jr. indoors, claiming that the atmosphere outside is poisonous to Morty Jr. However, this causes Morty Jr's relationship with Morty to become strained as when Morty tries to divert Morty Jr's attention to a dance on a children show, he ends up yelling at Morty Jr, causing Morty Jr to cry, something that Jerry and Beth remark \""Nice\"".\n\nSummer explains to Ma-Sha that a male Gazorpian was born on her planet, causing Ma-Sha to question her on the state of gender equality on Earth. This prompting an argument between Rick and Summer about gender roles on Earth, culminating in Rick popping a massive, resounding fart in protest, to the disgust of the female Gazorpians. Upon hearing Summer refer to Rick as \""grandfather\"" and realizing that Summer is the product of male/female reproduction, Ma-Sha orders their arrest. At the same time, Morty Jr. has grown into adolescence, picked up smoking and demands to be allowed to his warlike tendencies after watching documentaries on the History channel. Following an argument with Morty, Morty Jr. runs out of the house; discovering that the air is not poisonous to him, he runs away.\n\nMa-Sha sentences Summer and Rick to death, revealing after some bickering with Rick that they are to be crushed under a falling boulder. When Rick apologizes to Summer about their impending fate and complements her top, it gives her an idea. Summer protests by pointing out her top which Ma-Sha earlier complimented, which she explains was designed by a male Earthling fashion designer and proves it by showing them the design label. Saying that a fraction of male Earthlings are born gay, Summer explains that while gender separation has worked out well on Gazorpazorp, the same standards would not work on Earth nor would it be fair to enforce female Gazorpian standards on humans. Since the female Gazorpians acknowledge that she is better dressed than them in clothes made by a male, Ma-Sha should release them. Ma-Sha concedes, giving them a spaceship so Summer and Rick can return to their \""weird planet, where women are equal but not really\"".\n\nOn Earth, Morty Jr. has begun a rampage following an epiphany backed by music. Driven on Jerry's car, Morty tries to calm Morty Jr. down, which he eventually succeeds in. Morty admits to Morty Jr. that he is an alien and he wasn't a good father, but explains that he really wanted Morty Jr. to channel his destructive nature to creative outlets. Brad Anderson, the creator of the comic strip ''Marmaduke'', agrees as he walks by, revealing that Marmaduke is his creative outlet through which he channels his violent and sexual thoughts. Morty and Morty Jr. share a farewell hug just as Rick and Summer return to Earth, with Rick giving ownership of the Gazorpian spaceship to Summer. Beth asks where Rick has been, and Rick answers her by popping another fart which the whole family laughs at.\n\nFollowing the credits, Morty Jr. is seen on a television show (watched by everyone in the Smith household) with a talk show host, having matured into a middle-aged man and now the best-selling author of a book titled \""My Horrible Father\"" about his childhood experience. As Morty cringes, the family are stunned to watch and Beth assures her son that parenting is a thankless task and in the end he did the best he could. Downcast, Morty hopes that Jr. is eating enough."

[[Rick]] expresses disgust at the quality of television, and [[Jerry]] challenges him to provide anything better. Rick destroys the existing cable box and installs his own: a cable box capable of receiving television across infinite dimensions. The shows featured in these alternate realities vary wildly, such as a Showtime crime show in a reality where people evolved from corn. Rick flips through the channels to show the endless possibilities, before the family sees [[Jerry]] in an episode of David Letterman, in a reality where he was a famous movie star. This excites the rest of the family, and Rick gets annoyed feeling that they are getting obsessed about the wrong things.\n\nRick pulls out a pair of [[Inter-Dimensional Goggles]] that he throws into the kitchen, in which Jerry, [[Beth]], and [[Summer]] chase after. [[Morty]] says he does not care about himself enough to see what his alternate self would be like, in which Rick congratulates him. The two then watch various commercials and clips from alternate realities.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen taking turns using the goggles. Jerry sees himself doing cocaine with Johnny Depp while Beth sees herself operating on a person instead of a horse. Summer has trouble finding any other realities of her, except for a moment of the family playing [[Yahtzee]]. It's during this time that she first finds out that she was an unwanted pregnancy, and the news upsets her greatly. Seeing her parents achieve their dreams in realities where she was not born, she tells them that she is running away.\n\nThe alternate realities of their lives shake Jerry and Beth to the core, and they decide that maybe it'd be better to spend time apart. Summer goes upstairs and begins to pack, and Morty attempts to console her. She attempts to push him away before he points outside to the graves in the backyard (from the episode \""[[Rick Potion No. 9]]\""). He reveals the truth that he is not, in fact, her brother but a brother from another reality. Morty tells Summer \""Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody is going to die....Come watch TV?\""\n\nBeth keeps the goggles on while laying on the floor of the kitchen, enjoying her alternate life. The television in the main room shows [[Jerry Smith (C-500A)|alternate reality Jerry]] having a drug-induced breakdown, stripped down to his underwear, his head half-shaven, and driving a mobility scooter on a freeway with droves of police cars behind him. Rick almost changes the channel, but Jerry yells at him to keep it. They watch as alternate reality Jerry arrives at the doorstep of an alternate reality Beth, telling her that he hated his life and regretted not continuing their relationship. Beth and Jerry are stunned, as they run to each other to embrace.\n\nIn the post-credit sequence, the Smith family is watching the news in a Hamster-in-Butt World. The family asks Rick a wide variety of questions about the world until he begrudgingly creates a portal to the world so they can 'ask them yourselves.' Jerry excitedly calls it a family vacation and the Smith family spend a vacation in Hamster-In-Butt World where a photo montage show them all having a good time (even Rick at the end)."

[[Rick]] creates a small robot purely to pass the butter on the table when [[Morty]] comes into the kitchen to ask Rick to help him on his science project. [[Jerry]] jumps at the opportunity to work on a project with Morty due to his low self-confidence about his intelligence. Morty decides to agree. [[Summer]] asks for a ride to her job, which is defaulted to Rick since Jerry is 'busy'.\n\nRick gives Summer a ride to her job, which is helping out an eccentric old man run a 'vintage thrift store' called [[Needful Things]]. The shop is run by [[Mr. Needful]], and has just opened recently. Before Rick and Summer arrive, [[Mr. Goldenfold]] arrives by accident (thinking the shop was a Jamba Juice). Mr. Needful knows his name without introduction and gives him an [[M Shave's Aftershave|aftershave]] to help capture female attention. The aftershave is free, but Mr. Needful states \""Nobody ever pays here...not with money\"".\n\nSummer and Rick arrive into the shop, and Rick is immediately suspicious of Mr. Needful, asking whether he is the devil. This accusation startles Mr. Needful who quickly tries to give Rick a microscope, which Rick reluctantly takes as Summer pushes him out the door. Meanwhile, Jerry and Morty begin to work on a solar system model for his science project. Jerry states that Pluto is a planet and Morty attempts to correct him. However, Jerry refuses to say that Pluto is not a planet.\n\nMorty visits Rick in his garage, where Rick scans the microscope and finds that using it would have significantly lowered his IQ. Jerry barges in assuming Morty is asking Rick about whether Pluto is a planet or not. Jerry vehemently argues that if it was once a planet, it could be a planet again. Mr. Goldenfold returns to Needful Things, saying that the aftershave worked but made him impotent. After Rick arrives and administers a cure into Goldenfold, he reveals that he has invented a device to identify the negative effects of the cursed items. Rick goes around the store, scanning all the items and revealing their curses which scares away the customer base. Mr. Needful and Rick briefly fight before Summer pushes Rick out the door.\n\nJerry attempts to call NASA to argue about Pluto's planetary status. However, the two are quickly abducted by an alien ship and taken to Pluto, where they meet King Flippynips, the ruler of Pluto. The king is overjoyed that Jerry believes Pluto is a planet, and Jerry becomes a spokesperson to the population, assuring them that they are still a planet. The large cheering crowd quickly inflates Jerry's ego.\n\nNeedful Things begins to sell a variety of items, but Summer and Mr. Needful discover it's because Rick has opened another shop across the street called [[Curse Purge Plus!]]. The shop removes the curses for a fee, and is an instant hit. This causes a strain on Mr. Needful's confidence and he attempts to kill himself, but is saved by Summer. Summer arrives into Rick's shop to concede defeat, which results in Rick getting bored and burning the shop to the ground.\n\nJerry becomes famous to the Pluto population, appearing in various events to advocate that Pluto is a planet. Morty meets [[Scroopy Noopers]], a Plutonian scientist who reveals that major corporations are mining plutonium from Pluto's core, thus making the planet shrink and slowly die. Jerry's opinions fall into line with these corporations, who are desperate to keep the public uninformed about the problems. Morty's attempts to persuade his father to tell the populace the truth falls on deaf ears. It's only when King Flippynips captures Scroopy Noopers and reveals he's his son does Jerry work the courage to tell the population of Pluto their problems.\n\nMr. Needful opens a new business in the technology realm, opening n33dful.com to ravenous reviews. As he congratulates the workforce, he orders security on them and quickly fires Summer who feels betrayed. She reaches out to Rick who offers an idea. The two lift weights, take steroids and become incredibly muscular and ambush Mr. Needful at a tech talk before celebrating together.\n\nIn the after credits sequence, the muscular Rick and Summer beat up various mean-spirited people."

Angry that he was framed, Rick escapes the Council with Morty to go after the real culprit who set him up and finds that [[Evil Rick Sanchez|another Rick]] is supposedly responsible for murdering their counterparts while stealing their Mortys to conceal his presence.\n\nMeanwhile, as Morty begins to believe that he's nothing but a tool to protect Rick, [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] begins to bond with [[Doofus Rick|Rick J19\u03b67]], the kindest Rick in all of the realities.

Jerry is immensely excited to reenact moments from the movie, while Beth is hesitant and overall uninterested. In Beth and Jerry's absence, Beth orders [[Rick]], [[Morty]], and [[Summer]] not to trash the house while they are gone and she threatens to put an end to Rick and Morty's adventures if they do. The trio agree as Beth and Jerry drive off. Summer ignores the warnings and attempts to throw a party to become popular. Rick declines due to his plans to throw a party of his own.\n\nBeth and Jerry arrive at Titanic 2, which is a replica of the ill fated ship the RMS Titanic. Jerry sees the line to reenact the famous bow scene from the movie and tries to bring Beth along. Beth blows off his request, and shoves a nearby maid [[Lucy]] to join him instead. The two bond quickly over a mutual love for the Titanic. Meanwhile, the party at the Smith Residence begins. Some of the party-goers include [[Glip Glops]], [[Brad]], [[Bird Person]], [[Revolio Clockberg Jr.|Gear Head]], [[Squanchy]] and many more. The party begins to amp up and Morty confronts Rick about their decisions. [[Jessica]] appears, and Morty shifts his attention to talking to her. Jerry and Lucy continue to enjoy themselves on the ship, but the planned sinking of the ship goes wrong, and the ship doesn't sink due to technical difficulties. Rick's party is getting crazier, Summer blows off a friend of hers named [[Nancy]], which draws criticism from Rick. [[Abrodolph Lincoler]] then smashes through a wall. He gets into a brief altercation with [[Brad]] who promptly beats him up. Jessica is upset and runs outside, and Morty joins her to console her. While showing her various gadgets in the garage, he walks in on Squanchy masturbating (or \""squanching,\"" as he calls it) in a closet, and in the process accidentally knocks over a contraption that teleports the entire house into a weird planet. After Rick takes a look outside, he lets the party-goers know that everything is fine.\n\nMorty begins to freak out about the repercussions of his actions. Rick calms him down and tells him to collect some [[Collaxion Crystals]], which would ostensibly be used to take them back home. Rick convinces [[Abrodolph Lincoler]] to join Morty, and Summer talks [[Nancy]] into joining them as well. The three set out to find the crystals. On the Titanic 2, Lucy finds Jerry and takes him to a storage room where she quickly strips naked and asks him to draw her. Meanwhile, Morty, Nancy, and Lincoler find the crystals but are attacked by a two-headed beast. Lincoler fends off the beast whilst Morty and Nancy collect the crystals. He is mortally wounded whilst defending them. The remainder of the group return to the party and give the crystals to Rick who promptly crushes them up and snorts them. Rick's eyes turn blue, as he gets high, and he starts a rave called the \""Rick Dance\"" along with other party-goers. Rick admits that he can take them back whenever he wanted. Morty, furious after being lied to, throws the rest of the crystals outside. Meanwhile, Jerry attempts to break away from Lucy on the Titanic 2, but she pulls a gun on him and threatens him. She forces him to a prop car, where she attempts to force herself onto him. Beth arrives just in time, and knocks Lucy out with a book. Beth and Jerry pack up their car to leave and Lucy attaches herself to the underside of the car. She holds on briefly before falling and being run over, presumably killing her. Meanwhile, Morty ends the party and forces everyone out. The Smith House is in total shambles, and the cleanup effort begins. Morty is still immensely upset at Rick, but a conversation with [[Bird Person]] reveals to him that Rick is masking a great deal of inner pain, and shows Morty that if he truly wants to stop dealing with his grandfather, he should just leave the place destroyed. At first, Morty agrees that this might be the best thing that ever happened to him because  will be free of Rick forever. Birdperson then teaches him another saying that means \""Whatever lets you sleep at night.\""\n\nBeth and Jerry arrive home, and Birdperson tells him to make his decision as he leaves with Tammy. Morty realizes he does want to continue on his adventures with Rick and  pleads with him to do something about the state of the house before his parents walk through the front door. Rick uses a device that completely freezes time for everyone but them, allowing them an infinite amount of time to clean up the house and prevent Beth and Jerry from knowing the house was ever messy."
A Rickle in Time,2,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&titles=A_Rickle_in_Time&format=json,2_1_A Rickle in Time.txt,"[['Rick Sanchez'], ['Morty Smith'], ['Summer Smith'], ['Jerry Smith'], ['Beth Smith'], ['Shleemypants'], ['Chris'], ['Albert Einstein']]","The episode opens with time still frozen from [[Ricksy Business|the ending of Season One]]. Outside of the [[Smith Residence]], [[Morty]] and [[Summer]] finish up some last minute cleaning duties while [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] and [[Beth Smith|Beth]] are still frozen outside. It's revealed that time has been frozen for nearly six months. Before [[Rick]] unfreezes time, he admits that 'their' time may need time to stabilize back within the 'world's time'. As a precaution, he tells Morty and Summer not to touch their parents at all, or otherwise their existence might fall apart at the seams.\n\nWhen time is unfrozen, Mr. Benson falls off the roof while both Jerry and Beth are very clearly confused with the entire house not destroyed. Rick insists that Jerry was just seeing the negative and he warmly greets Beth. Beth attempts to hug her father and children, but they pull back, insisting it's because they missed them a lot and hugging would destroy them (it literally would). As a means to play it safe, Rick bribes the two into leaving to buy ice cream. He kicks a pile of unmarked bills to get them out of the house. Soon, Morty and Summer experience a bit of sibling rivalry over who's closer to Rick. As they shove each other, it generates a direct rift in time, creating two parallel realities which exist separately from each other. Rick tells his grandchildren that their 'uncertainty' has caused time to fracture into two equally possible impossibilities. Rick says they aren't in any timelines, and to prove it he opens the garage door to reveal the house floating in the middle of a black void surrounded by Schr\u00f6dinger's cats.\n\nAfter getting ice cream, Jerry and Beth accidentally strike a deer. The deer isn't killed but severely injured. Beth takes it upon herself to help heal the deer. Beth takes the deer into a veterinary hospital and attempts to perform surgery. Before she begins her procedure, she notices a gunshot wound in its side. A hunter appears and says he was the one who shot him. He claims the deer belongs to him and calls his lawyer to help him gain ownership. The hunter's lawyer appears at the animal hospital and lets them know about Brad's Law and how legally the deer belongs to the hunter. Beth ignores him and continues to operate.\n\nRick uses a [[Time Crystal]] to try to mend the timelines together, but Morty and Summer's continued uncertainty prevents the fusion from working. Rick demands to know the reason behind their uncertainty. He deduces that the two of them 'want to be grandpa's favorite' and then sits them down in front of a whiteboard and cruelly tells both of them how little he cares about them and how little he values their contributions. His long speech clearly upsets both of them. Before Rick attempts to mend time together once again, Morty makes a quip about his drinking habits which directly result in Rick becoming uncertain. The time fusion fails for the second time and Rick immediately thinks that his 'other self' is trying to kill him off to fix the problem.\n\nRick quickly creates a pistol with his time crystal and attempts to kill the other self. A shootout opens up with both Ricks across timelines trying to murder each other. The chaos results in time splitting a second time, leading to four separate realities. Morty knocks out Rick from behind in order to calm him down. Morty and Summer put Rick into a dog crate. Rick reawakens in the crate and proves he's certain across all four timelines by calling himself and leaving a message. He then receives three other voicemails simultaneously. Suddenly, a [[Fourth Dimensional Being]] appears and scolds Rick for attempting to piece time together with just a crystal. He gives Rick, Morty, and Summer [[Time-Stabilizing Collar|time-stabilizing collars]] that then correctly fuse their times back to its regular place. However, since Rick obtained the time crystal by illegal means, the being tells them that they will go to [[Time Prison]] for eternity.\n\nAfter the being calls for backup, Rick tricks him and makes a grab for his 'gun' [[Chris]], discarding and killing it. Rick orders Morty and Summer to remove their collars. He forces himself to be uncertain to split time once again. The three continue to split time in order to overwhelm the being, punching him across multiple timelines until he's defeated. As a consequence, time is now split across 64 different possibilities.\n\nBeth's surgery continues with all the characters gathered around her. Jerry comes to the rescue by bringing members of a Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose, Deer, and Stag. The members can transport the deer across state lines to the best doctors, and outside the jurisdiction of the hunter's claim. The two drive back into the woods with the Cervine Institute members and Jerry reveals that the two men were not from the Cervine Institute, but were actually employees at Cold Stone Creamery. This allows Beth to continue her operation. She successfully patches up the deer, who springs to life and returns to the woods.\n\nRick, Morty, and Summer all attempt to put their collars on. Summer's works immediately, but due to a faulty Morty collar in one of the timelines (and Rick attempting to fix it), all of Morty and Rick's are still split. The broken-collared Morty attempts to hand the collar to Rick but with time destabilizing, falls into the black void. Rick dives after him, but Morty dropped his collar, so Rick gives Morty his collar. All Mortys are then safely teleported back. With one Rick floating in the spaceless void, he accepts death and tells Morty to be better than him. But then, Rick spots Morty's collar floating below him. He scrambles to collar while begging God for everything to work out. He fixes the collar, immediately denounces God, and then is teleported safely back with all others. Rick and Summer celebrate by doing the Cabbage Patch dance.\n\nBeth and Jerry return while Jerry begins to make fun of the three's time collars while Beth laughs. Morty asks Rick if being the one who is taunted doesn't feel good to which Rick agrees that it hurts. The pan out at the end of the episode shows Mr. Benson below his house, receiving roses in a wheelchair, indicating that he still survived the fall. The after credits sequence shows two Fourth Dimensional Beings quickly navigate through Earth's history to find Rick. They stumble upon [[Albert Einstein]], thinking it's Rick, and promptly beat him up, warning him not to mess with time. This results in Einstein discovering E=mc<sup>2</sup> out of spite."

He then gets a call from an unknown person asking the person where they will meet and ends the lesson, citing that they have some business to attend to. He then gets startled when [[Jerry]] suddenly ask a question about navigation and gets asked by Rick why he is on the ship, to which he says that \""We [Rick and Jerry] agreed that a boy's father should be present when he's learning to drive\"". Rick exclaims that they do not have time to get him back home so they send him at [[Jerryboree]], a cross-temporal daycare designed specifically for Jerrys.\n\nAfter they arrive at the location about the unknown caller, Rick tells him to wait but Morty is insistent to come but he rejects it and defends himself after Morty thinks what he is doing is shady. A gromflomite then knocks on the windows, gives Rick 3000 flerbos and then ask him if he has 'the weapon'. Rick introduces the person to Morty, and gives hive and antimatter gun. The gromflomite then introduces himself as [[Krombopulos Michael]], alien assasin. After Michael left, Morty then questions if he sends weapons to killers for money. Rick reveals that sold the gun to afford an afternoon at a video arcade [[Blips and Chitz]], which features a game called \""[[Roy: A Life Well Lived]]\"". Morty, upset by Rick's immoral decision, attempts to stop Krombopulous Michael from killing his target. After accidentally killing Krombopulous Michael with his poor spaceship piloting, Morty is introduced to the assassin's target, who assumes the name \""[[Fart]]\"".\n\nMorty insists on freeing Fart and helping him get back to the wormhole he came through to return him to his race. [[Galactic Federation|Government]] forces give chase, leading to a shoot out with lots of civilian casualties, and Rick rages that none of these people would have died if Morty hadn't interfered with Krombopulous Michael. After returning Fart to the wormhole to his home planet, Fart reveals his plan to return with his race and \""cure\"" all carbon based life forms from the universe. Morty is then forced to make a moral decision, and kills his friend using the antimatter gun, meaning that all the deaths and destruction that resulted from his decision to save Fart were for nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry has spent his time socializing with many other Jerrys at Jerryboree, before being picked up atop  the end of the day. The three are then called over by another Rick and Morty asking if they have their Jerry. Morty reveals he has lost his fathers number and only has a Blips and Chitz ticket. The two Ricks swap Jerrys without knowing which Jerry is which.

Independence|alien starship]]. Rick intercepts and boards the starship with the intention of looting it, but instead he comes across the ship's surviving crew members, who explain [[Unity's Planet|their planet]] has been taken over by an assimilating hive-mind, before the aforementioned hive mind attacks and assimilates the rest of the crew. To the trio's shock, the hive mind apparently knows Rick, who awkwardly admits that he and the hive mind, named Unity, used to \""date.\""\n\nBack on the planet Unity overtook, Unity explains how it was able to take over the entire population, unifying the world and improving the quality of the inhabitants' life, at the cost of their free will and individuality. Despite being treated well by Unity, Summer protests the loss of the original population's individuality, but, as Unity controls every mind on the planet, her attempts to \""free\"" the inhabitants do not go very far. Elsewhere on the planet, Unity and Rick waste no time rekindling their relationship rather extravagantly. Not long after, a neighboring hive mind called [[Beta-Seven]] arrives on a routine trading mission. Beta-Seven is ostensibly attempting to pursue a closer relationship with Unity, but its awkward efforts only cause Rick to make fun of it. As it leaves, Rick notices the materials Beta Seven left behind can be mixed into various drugs to help spice up his and Unity's partying and kinky sex.\n\nMeanwhile, back on Earth, Jerry enters the garage looking for the weed-whacker because the weeds in the cracks made from the house being transported to another dimension have started to become overgrown. He is confronted by Beth, who chastises him for being in the garage when Rick is not present. The two argue, but are interrupted by a gurgling sound from under what they discover to be a hatch in the floor.\n\nBack on Unity's planet, Morty and Summer notice that Unity's control on the population appears to be slipping, and the inhabitants begin to regain their minds. However, the newly freed people almost immediately begin a race war among themselves. Morty and Summer are almost caught in the crossfire before Unity manages to rescue them. While Unity is transporting them to Rick, they notice Unity's inebriated state and realize that the drug-and-alcohol laden parties are hurting Unity's ability to control the population.\n\nBack at home, Beth and Jerry descend into the underground lair and discover [[Blim Blam]], a [[Korblockians|Korblockian]] that eats babies, imprisoned by Rick in order to cure his \""Space AIDS\"". They soon begin bickering, to the point where the creature, fed up with the arguing, breaks free of his restraints, steals a translation device from the lab, and angrily explains the reason for his imprisonment and berates them both about how awful their marriage is, and then leaving, promising never to return to Earth.\n\nOn Unity's planet, Morty and Summer try to get Rick to go home with them, but Rick dismisses them, sending them home via portal before continuing to party with Unity. At this point, Summer and Morty warn Unity and Rick about the terrible influence they have on each other and tell Unity to, \""take care of [itself]\"".\n\nLater, when Rick leaves Unity to use the restroom, all the planet's inhabitants are gone, leaving behind farewell notes for Rick explaining that, while Unity enjoyed its time with him, they cannot be together; they are too alike in the sense that both of them turn others into mirror images of themselves, though in Rick's case, he does so through bad influence rather than assimilation. Unity mentions that Rick is even better at fulfilling what itself was destined to do through coming into existence as a hive-mind; that Rick is able to change others yet is not able to be reformed himself, which leads to his self-destructive, reckless nature eventually bringing those around him down with him and invariably sentences them to suffer because of his own emotional barriers and methods of resisting the inevitability of meaninglessness and his own pain. It ends the letter by affirming that it loves him and is upset it cannot be with him.\n\nDepressed and alone, Rick returns home, where he is confronted by Beth over the basement lair and the escaped alien. To Beth's (and the whole family's) shock, Rick simply concedes and retreats to the garage. Here, he dejectedly assembles the parts of a death ray and unfreezes a deformed, distressed creature (possibly a Cronenberg) he had been storing. On the verge of tears, he lovingly comforts the screaming, suffering creature before vaporising it with the death ray. He then prepares to do this to himself, but passes out unconscious before the machine can fully prepare the ray, causing him to barely survive this suicide attempt. He then laid passed out at his workstation in the garage for the rest of the day and night. The episode ends zooming out to show Rick passed out at his desk the next morning and Jerry happily whacking the weeds in the driveway.\n\nAfter the credits, Rick and Morty are at Beta-Seven's mothership, where Unity is staying. Rick demands to see Unity. Beta-Seven informs Rick he is considered a \""hostile entity\"" and threatens to attack the two unless they leave, which Rick reluctantly does at Morty's urging."

When [[Rick]] comes into the room, he doesn't know who Uncle Steve is, and the family rebuffs him, claiming that Uncle Steve has stayed with them for the past year. Rick then pulls out a laser pistol and shoots Uncle Steve, who turns out to be a monster. While the Smith family gasp in shock at the realization that Uncle Steve wasn't real, Rick informs them that he was a parasite, an alien species that survive and multiply by implanting fake memories into people's head so they can conquer planets. He tells them to be aware of \""wacky, zany characters that suddenly appear\"" and is encouraged by a newly introduced zany character, [[Mr. Poopybutthole]].\n\nIn the living room, everyone is checking for more parasites. Rick makes a sign and places it on the wall saying that there should only be 6 people in the house: Rick, Morty, Jerry, [[Beth]], Mr. Poopybutthole, and [[Summer]]. Saying that they can't take chances of letting parasites out of the house, he activates blast shields that keep people from coming in or out of the house, much to the chagrin of the rest of the family. Mr. Poopybutthole encourages the family to remember the time the family got stuck in an elevator after watching a musical featuring The Hulk and were freed by \""[[Cousin Nicky]]\"". The memory flashback causes a parasite to multiply, and Cousin Nicky is shown in the room. After looking at the sign, Rick shoots Cousin Nicky in the shoulder, which turns him into a dead parasite. After another memory flashback, where a Nazi as well as a butler named [[Mr. Beauregard]] appear. As more and more memory flashbacks occur, more and more parasite characters appear (such as [[Frankenstein's Monster]], a man named Sleepy Gary who is [[Beth]]'s husband, food themed warriors, etc.). Rick starts to become irritated at the surplus of parasites and insults them all while they attempt to persuade Rick to disable the blast shields. After being goaded into having a flashback of having a barbecue with more characters, he is pushed over the edge and the house is filled. As arguing ensues, Jerry has suspicions that he is a parasite and confides in Sleepy Gary, who he truly believes is Beth's husband. Comforting him, Sleeping Gary implants a memory of he and Jerry having an affair while on a vacation, making the latter believe that they are in love.\n\nAs he insults more and more parasites, the aliens start to turn suspicion onto Rick, manipulating the false memories in the Smiths to turn them against him. The Smiths constantly attempt to persuade Rick into freeing everyone from the household even after [[Reverse Giraffe]] speaks. After he refuses to do so, the parasites soon beat up Rick and steal the watch that controls the blast shield. After Rick insults the Smith Family (mostly Morty) for not trusting him, Morty takes Rick's gun. Unable to kill Rick in front of a zany character named [[Pencilvester]], [[Baby Wizard]], [[Duck With Muscles]] and Morty take him out to the garage. After telling Rick that he'll remember him as a friend and unsatisfied, Rick retorts that he'll remember Morty as a \""whiny bitch\"" citing that a minority of his memories of Morty were pleasant, and the majority were just pure annoyance. However, after listening to Ricks statement about good and bad memories, Morty has an epiphany and shoots Baby Wizard and Duck with Muscles. He explains to Rick that he found the tell-tale sign; the parasites were only capable of creating pleasant memories. So, he was able to know that Rick was real by all the terrible memories he had of him. Realizing Morty's theory was correct, Rick unlocks his armory and they both heavily arm themselves.\n\nComing back into the house, Rick and Morty fire warning shots into the air and explain that they need to kill everyone that can only be remembered fondly. They begin by questioning [[Mrs. Refrigerator]], who attempts to prove that she was in an unpleasant memory by passing off a roller-coaster ride as screaming torment. Beth tells Mrs. Refrigerator that rollercoasters are more thrilling than unpleasant and reminds her that she had be a perfect companion to her for her entire life. Mrs. Refrigerator goes into a panic, tries to claw her way through the blast shields and is shortly killed and exposed as a memory parasite. Rick questions Summer who is annoyed at the accusation being made against her. Morty then validates Summer's existence as he recalls her kicking him in the groin when she believed him of going into her room, despite Morty protesting his innocence while cringing on the ground. After being armed, Summer joins the two in questioning Beth. Summer then remembers when she asked her drunk mother to take her to school for picture day and was given a black eye when Beth accidentally hits her with a wine bottle. Beth kills a bear like parasite (who had compatible kidneys with her) and the Smiths kill the remaining parasites. As they kill parasites, Summer confirms Morty is real by remembering accidentally walking in on him masturbating in the kitchen. Beth kills Sleepy Gary, sending Jerry into a depression, asking Beth to kill him so they can be together in death. To her chagrin, Beth remembers a memory when Jerry was being chased by a feral homeless man with a broken bottle and locks himself inside the car, leaving Beth to fend for herself. \n\nBack downstairs, Rick comes across Pencilvester and has such fond \""memories\"" of him, that he can't bring himself to kill him. Rick then asks Morty to kill Pencilvester. After killing Mr. Beauregard, Rick jokes that ''he'' did the butler, though [[Ghost in a Jar]] is the only one who gets it. Rick thanks Ghost in a Jar before shooting him as well, and eventually all the parasites are destroyed.\n\nThe family and Mr. Poopybutthole then sit down for dinner. Beth, being suspicious of the lack of bad memories of Mr. Poopybutthole, pulls out a ray gun and blasts him. However, it turns out that Mr. Poopybutthole is actually real, as instead of reverting into a parasite, he is blasted into a wall and begins bleeding out from the wound in his torso. The family calls an ambulance, while Beth runs into the kitchen. Panicked, she pours a glass of wine with very shaky hands and downs it with eyes almost blinded with tears.\n\nThe post-credits scene reveals that Mr. Poopybutthole is alive and recovering in physical therapy. The nurse informs the family that Mr. Poopybutthole does not wish to see them right now, and that he is \""sorry you didn't have bad memories of him\"". As Jerry comforts Beth, Rick does one of his weird catchphrases."

In desperation, Rick and Morty compose and perform the song \""Get Schwifty\"". The head is pleased and transports the entire Earth to an intergalactic musical competition, viewed by more Cromulons, where the losers' planets are obliterated. Rick then tells the President that any astronauts they had in orbit at the time are dead.\n\nRick and Morty team up with Ice-T to compose a new song, but Morty panics and steals Rick's portal device to save his family. Ice-T reveals himself to be a jaded alien and leaves Rick alone. Jerry, Beth, Summer and Ethan get involved with [[Headism|a religious cult]] whose beliefs are based on their interpretation of the actions of the Cromulons. Morty gets lost and traverses several portal openings, eventually stumbling onto Bird Person's world. Bird Person encourages Morty to have faith in Rick and sends him back to Earth.\n\nGeneral Nathan ends up losing it, betrays the president, and launches nuclear bombs at the host Cromulon as he was wanting to do the whole episode, however this barely effects him and in reply, he simply states ''<nowiki>''</nowiki>BOO, NOT COOL!<nowiki>''</nowiki>'' and he disqualify Earth, but Ice-T returns and saves the planet from annihilation. Rick and Morty, back together again, perform a new hit song, satisfy the Cromulons, and win the contest. Nathan runs at the president with an M16 after all is saved, but Rick turns him into a snake. Meanwhile, the alien head cult quickly disbands after realizing it was all just a musical reality show.\n\nIn the post-credits, Ice-T returns to his planet upon his exile and is restored to his Water-T form. When the [[Numbericons]] attack with his father [[Helium-Q]] getting killed by a falling debris, Water-T leads the [[Alphabetrium]] inhabitants into fighting the Numbericons."

Morty responds, after thinking for a moment, that one of the lunch ladies was found dead, her body drained of blood and marked by two holes in her neck. Beth's horror, as she has no idea how such a horrible thing could happen, is quickly quenched by a nonchalant Rick, who reveals that vampires are real; the revelation horrifies Summer, but Rick casually tells her that humanity has known of their existence for hundreds of years. Terrified of the possibility of being killed by a vampire, Summer desperately asks to grandpa Rick if he could go to their school by transferring his consciousness into the body of a teenager, which Rick considers a stupid idea and insults Summer for it. Beth tries to get Jerry to support Summer, but Jerry is too distracted by his tablet to pay attention, leading to a conflict. Rick grows tired of their fights and declares that he will take them to off-planet therapy to fix their relationship.\n\nAt school Morty and Summer discuss how best to deal with the vampire issue when they are greeted by \""[[Tiny Rick]]\"": Rick decided to help them out by putting himself into high-school aged clone of himself temporarily. After killing the vampire (who as it turns out was [[Coach Feratu]]), Tiny Rick heads home to transfer his mind into the older Rick's body, which is stored in a vat in the garage. However, Summer gets a text from [[Toby Matthews]] asking if they could have a party at the Smith house, but wants to have Tiny Rick there as well. Tiny Rick decides to stay in his younger body to let Morty and Summer have a party. At the party Tiny Rick performs a song on his guitar, the lyrics of which sound like desperate pleas from the older Rick to get him out of Tiny Rick's body, but nobody notices except Summer, who realizes something odd is happening. Tiny Rick quickly becomes popular with the rest of the school, in turn increasing Morty and Summer's social standing, but Summer becomes increasingly worried that Rick has become trapped in his young body. Morty initially ignores her as Jessica has begun talking to him as a direct result of Tiny Rick, but his suspicions are raised when Rick's dance solo at the school dance includes lyrics practically begging someone to help him return to his old body. Unwilling to let this continue, Summer hides the wooden stakes they used to kill Coach Feratu in Tiny Rick's locker, resulting in his expulsion. Tiny Rick turns the entire school (including Toby Matthews) on Summer. Morty finally has enough, and he and Summer sneak up on Tiny Rick just as he is trying to destroy Rick's original body and they force him to listen to Elliot Smith music. Rick's emotional reaction to the music allows him to break free of his younger self's control, and he gets his grandkids to transfer his mind back to his older body. Once this is finished, he heads down to his underground lair and brutally destroys his other younger clones, with a newfound respect for his current age.\n\nAfter Rick drops off (or rather abandons) Beth and Jerry at therapy, they are greeted by [[Glexo Slim Slom]]. Glexo puts Jerry into a helmet attached to a machine that creates [[Beth's Mytholog|Jerry's perception of Beth]], a monstrous creature. Beth is immediately offended by this, telling Jerry to take it back. Beth then puts on the helmet, creating a [[Jerry's Mytholog|weak, worm version of Jerry]]. Jerry is also upset by Beth's perception of him. Glexo then leads the couple and other visitors on a tour of the facility, where all the couples' perceptions are kept in cages. The idea behind the therapy is that the perceptions are not the real marriages and that they are all safe from the perceptions. However, in a major disaster, Beth's mytholog manipulates Jerry's mytholog into helping her escape, and she rampages through the facility, killing staff and visitors alike. Glexo angrily informs Jerry and Beth that this is a sign that their relationship has become co-dependent, and the truth is neither of them should ever have gotten married (to which Jerry and Beth declare this is just bad couple's therapy). When the evacuation results in Jerry and Beth being left behind in the facility, Beth gets kidnapped by her own mytholog and attached to one of the machines to make more of her pathetic Jerrys. Beth questions why not just have Jerry make more Beths, but her mytholog replies that in Jerry's mind there can only be one true Beth. Jerry, encountering his own mytholog, grows frustrated that this is Beth's perception of who he really is and heroically comes to rescue her, causing Beth to create heroic Jerry mythologs who help Jerry in his fight (only to start making narcissistic Jerrys when she gets annoyed with his self-indulgent monologue). Just when it looks like they are losing the battle with the Beth mytholog Jerry has the idea to attach the helmet to one of his strong selves, creating Goddess Beth who destroys the monster, ending the fight. As the Jerry mythologs bow down to their goddess, the real Beth and Jerry reconcile.\n\nIn the epilogue, a vampire reports to the [[Vampire Master]] that Coach Feratu was destroyed. The master is flabbergasted that he named his alias after a famous vampire movie and makes a new rule: no more \""clever name bullshit\""."

His doctor, accompanied by a number of others, explains that the galaxy's most influential civil rights leader, [[Shrimply Pibbles]], is in the same hospital dying; he can be saved, however, if Jerry donates his sexual organs to Pibbles to act as a heart. An elderly alien in a wheelchair arrives, and he expresses his doubt that Jerry will help him, as Earth culture is built around sex. Upset by the notion, Jerry agrees to donate his organs in an attempt to redeem Earth's reputation.\n\nAfter a brief remark by Morty about an odd-looking woman getting coffee, Rick turns to \""[[How Did I Get Here?]]\"", and Morty discovers that the odd woman has disappeared from the waiting room, having suddenly reappeared on top of a streetlamp in the show. The entire family is perplexed by the occurrence, and Rick advises them to \""stay away from the coffee machine.\"" They then watch an ad for \""[[Jan Quadrant Vincent 16]]\"" (an action-adventure starring several copies of Jan Michael Vincent).\n\nJerry, in the meantime, is having second thoughts about donating to Pibbles, and he tells his doctor that he wants to consult with Beth before moving forward with the surgery. After the rest of the family watches \""[[The Adventures of Stealy]]\"" and \""[[Funny Songs]]\"", the doctor comes into the waiting room and addresses the family, telling them that Jerry is fine, but also asking the Beth come with him. After Jerry tells her about the surgery, the conversation among Beth, Jerry and the doctor spirals downward, but upon reading the catalog of highly advanced prosthetics Jerry can be given to replace his missing organs, Beth decides to let Jerry choose for himself. Still not willing to say no, Jerry concedes.\n\nAs the family watches \""[[Lil' Bits]]\"" (a commercial for a restaurant with minuscule food portions), Jerry is given the chance to \""use\"" his organs one last time, as the doctor leaves him in his office with alien pornography and a towel. Not aroused by the videos, Jerry discovers that the doctor has left Pibbles' medical records open behind the windows of porn; the doctor then re-enters the room and tells Jerry as much, asking him to use discretion. Jerry does not, but instead examines the medical records and finds a piece of information that he believes will allow him to keep his sexual organs.\n\nWatching \""Opposite News with Michael Thompson\"" and \""Cooking Things with Pichael Thompson\"", the family soon discovers that the two hosts are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins conjoined twins], shooting their shows simultaneously side-by-side. Rick remarks to Summer that she \""has no idea how much that must save production.\"" The hospital meanwhile holds a news conference to announce that Pibbles can be saved, and also to introduce Jerry, the donor responsible for the opportunity. When Jerry, speaking to the very large crowd, mentions Pibbles' \""ongoing battle with heroin dependency\"", the crowd applauds enthusiastically. A confused Jerry inquires as to whether or not the heroin issue was a matter of public record, to which a few upset reporters reply that heroin comprised ten percent of the atmosphere of Pibbles' home planet\u2014at least, before it was destroyed by Klargon death squads, which rendered him unable to breathe without heroin. The entire audience boos Jerry, realizing that he is trying to keep from losing his member.\n\nRick, Summer, and Morty watch an episode of \""[[How They Do It]]\"" (which details the manufacturing process behind the plumbus) and [http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Personal_Space \""The Personal Space Show\""] (hosted by a man obsessed with keeping his personal space unoccupied, even by his own skin)\u2014which is followed by an advert for \""The Northsiders\""\u2014before finding an alien athletic competition. At the press conference, one of the doctors quiets the furious crowd, announcing that large numbers of people, having heard of Jerry's double-cross and wanting to save Pibbles, have donated enough money to purchase a synthetic heart for him. Jerry, upset and offended, begins to think of a way to regain his honor. Later, as the surgery begins, Jerry bursts into the operating room wielding a pistol-like apparatus, demanding that they cut off his member and use it to save Pibbles.\n\nRick, Summer, and Morty, in the meantime, watch [http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Octopus_Man \""Octopus Man\""], a clip that ends with the main character needlessly stabbing two random people to death on the street. Summer voices opposition to unnecessary violence in television, and Morty responds by yelling that her views on television are primitive. Beth arrives, telling them that they can leave, but a news report suddenly breaks through, announcing that Jerry is holding the doctors hostage. Discovering that the holdup is not happening in another dimension, Beth and Summer rush to the scene, where Jerry is in a standoff with two armed guards; demanding to know what is going on, Jerry only replies, \""I'm a good person.\"" Beth then realizes that the thing Jerry is holding is not a gun, but one of the highly advanced vibrators from the catalog. Out of options, Jerry pulls down his pants and runs at Pibbles' body, tearfully reasserting that he is \""a good person\"". The guards open fire on Jerry, shooting him fifty-seven times as the entire family screams in horror (Rick and Morty watch the events unfold on the television); they continue to shoot him even after his mangled, lifeless body falls to the floor.\n\nSome time later, Jerry awakens to an advertisement for [http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Butthole_Ice_Cream \""Butthole Ice Cream Parlor\""]. Realizing he is awake, Beth tells him that everything he remembers really happened, and that since they were at an alien hospital, repairing his body was, in Beth's words, \""like getting a splinter removed.\"" Jerry says that all he wanted was for people to like him, not hate him, and Beth responds that \""You can't make people like you. You just have to wait for hating you to bore them.\"" Rising from his bed, Jerry declares his intent to go to the zoo with his family, but they angrily shoot him down.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Jerry sneaks into Rick's cupboard and tries to steal his Eyeholes cereal to eat from it only to be immediately assaulted by the furious Eyehole Man. Summer and Morty work to get the Eyeholes Man off of Jerry as Rick puts the box back in his cupboard while reprimanding Jerry for going through his part of the cupboard. Morty quotes \""Why do you even have those?\"""

Upon arriving, Rick discovers that the citizens of the planet sustain their peaceful way of life by engaging in open warfare on one night every year; upon discovering that the aforementioned night (which the citizens call \""The Festival\"") is that very evening, Rick pleasantly proposes to Morty that they stay and observe the murderous rite.\n\nThey succeed in finding wiper fluid, and they depart as the sun sets, flying low over the surface of the planet as the Festival begins. Rick's enthusiasm for the Festival is quickly crushed by a particularly gruesome death, which sprays copious amounts of blood onto his windshield. As he vomits out his window, thoroughly disgusted by the sight, Morty sees a girl in trouble and demands of Rick that they save her; when Rick objects, Morty blackmails him into complying. Upon landing (on top of one of the girl's attackers), Rick enthusiastically begins shooting everybody who comes near them. Morty suggests that the girl, [[Arthricia]], wait out the Festival in their ship, and Rick sarcastically agrees.\n\nAt the [[Smith Residence|Smith house]], [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] and [[Summer Smith|Summer]] get into an argument over Jerry's pointless conversation, and Jerry leaves the room while being heckled by Summer.\n\nArthricia asks Morty to stop asking her questions about The Festival, leading to an awkward silence. The girl suddenly screams that she has forgotten about her grandmother; the group travels to a ramshackle farmhouse, where, despite his misgivings, Rick follows Arthricia inside. She then double-crosses them: she overpowers Rick, steals his gun and shoots him with it, finally coercing Morty to surrender the ship. Apologizing to him, she flies away into the night, struggling with the controls. Moving inside the cabin, now on fire, Morty finds Rick wounded on the floor, and helps him out of the shack. A group of people advance on them; when Rick disintegrates one of them, however, they surrender and give him their weapons.\n\nSummer and Jerry begin to renew their argument, but before they can do so, the \""space phone\"" Rick gave them rings, and Summer retrieves it from its somewhat forgotten place between the sofa cushions. Hiding out in a shack with Morty and in the process of creating a chemical solution to heal his wound, Rick gives them the details of their situation and, between dispatching people bursting into the cabin and Jerry asking if the person on the phone is [[Taddy Mason]], he dictates a number to Summer. After killing the last intruder with a spoon (the only thing Morty threw to Rick when he asked for help) and berating Morty for throwing him \""the one thing that can never kill anything\"", Rick tells Summer to find a red box over his workbench, take it outside, and enter the aforementioned number into the box.\n\nTo set up a beacon for what Rick identifies only as a \""package\"", Rick and Morty head toward a lighthouse, intending to assemble the beacon on the observation platform. However, the owner of the lighthouse consents only on the condition that one of them listens to a story of his. While Rick heads to the top of the lighthouse, Morty agrees to listen to the story, which he discovers is not only a movie script but is absolutely atrocious. To pass the time, he decides to eat one of the two candy bars given to them by the person who gave them the wiper fluid.\n\nSummer and Jerry go to the garage, where Summer retrieves the red box and places it on the floor, berating Jerry for his insistence on resolving his issue as she inputs the numbers into the box. Upon the completion of the sequence, the box pops open, forming a launchpad for a large, silvery orb with a smaller red dot on its side. As Jerry continues trying to restore his dignity, the orb hurls itself through the ceiling into the sky, leading Summer to muse, \""Oh...he might have said to take it outside.\""\n\nOn the observation deck, Rick finishes assembling the receiver, while down in the main room, the owner finishes reading to Morty, whose patience is wearing thin. After repeatedly asking Morty for his honest opinion, Morty says he has a problem with the way the story begins with a flash back teaser, and the owner, suddenly offended, responds by ordering them to leave. Morty becomes confused and the owner claims that he shared something personal with him and he, \""took a giant shit on it\"". Morty becomes offended by the attacks against his character and tells the owner that they just asked to set up a beacon. The owner tells Morty that they no longer can do so because Morty is a, \""shitty person and insecure\"" and mounts the stairs. Upon reaching the top, he tells Rick to leave claiming that Morty is a, \""shitty person\"". Morty quickly defends himself by claiming that he, \""sat through\"" the entire screen play, further infuriating the owner. Fed up with the owners insecurities, Morty reveals that he hated the entire story. Rick reminds Morty that they're guests, Morty retorts that he tried to behave himself but the owner dragged his anger out. When the owner tries to shut the receiver down himself, Morty stops him, claiming that he's not a bad person just because the owner is insecure about his writing and pushes him down the flight of stairs in a fit of rage, killing him and leaving Rick astonished.\n\nJerry again tries to reconnect with Summer by recalling memories of the past, but the conversation devolves into a plea for money by Jerry. Summer leaves him in the garage by himself, and a piece of the shattered roof falls on his head, just after he utters \""...Guess this is what rock bottom feels like\""..\n\nLeaving the lighthouse, a horde of rioters confronts them, including the man who gave them the wiper fluid and candy bars. Before a fight can break out, however, the orb-like probe lands between Rick and Morty and assembles suits of weaponized flying armor onto their bodies. Rick immediately begins to slaughter the mob. At first, Morty is hesitant, but he soon finds his, \""inner rage\"" and slaughters the entire mob (as his suit plays \""Feels Good\"" by Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!). Rick congratulates Morty on finding the ability to purge and they looking for their ship. Rick succeeds in finding it, crashed into the side of a building, but turns around to find Morty once again slaughtering every person in sight, even those who are hiding; even once every one has been killed, Morty continues firing round after round into long-dead bodies even as Rick gently ushers him back toward the ship.\n\nReaching the ship, they find Arthricia crawling on the ground nearby. As they train their weapons on her, she explains her true intentions: to use the ship to murder the arrogant rich people who force the peasants to fight to the death. Morty, drunk with rage, insists on killing Arthricia on the spot, but Rick tells Morty to calm down. Morty then threatens to kill Rick, at which point Rick tasers Morty to get him under control and asks Arthricia where the rich people are.\n\nAt a mansion outside of town, the planet's wealthy make a dinner toast to another successful year of The Festival, which has been going on for thousands of years. Moments later, the sound of \""[[Feels Good]]\"" floats through the air, and Arthricia, now wearing Morty's power suit, and Rick, with Morty tied to his back, break down the door. Rick tells the rich people that he has nothing against them, but that Arthricia is deeply offended by their forcing the peasants to kill each other while suffering no consequence themselves. He further explains that Arthricia's suit of power armor is a way of fairly apportioning power among them. Arthricia then begins to exact her revenge, slaughtering the rich people and inviting Rick to join in the bloodbath. Rick initially refuses, saying the killing has become \""gratuitous\"", but eventually joins in after being asked a second time. After killing all the rich people, Rick and Arthricia ecstatically dance to \""Feels Good\"".\n\nAs the sun rises in the morning, Morty finally wakes at the ship. After being encouraged by Rick, Morty goes over to talk to Arthricia, who spurns him by saying that she has a boyfriend.\n\nAs Rick and Morty are preparing to leave, the townsfolk discuss building a new society from the ground up, and Rick suggests using food to barter. After Rick and Morty leave, the discussion about food escalates into a bloody brawl. One of the townsfolk stops the brawl and explains a plan for stopping the violence, which stabilizes the basic concept of The Festival within the society.\n\nOn their way back to Earth, Morty reflects on his rage-fueled rampage with shame. Rick assures him that none of his actions were his fault and that the cause of his violent rage was due to eating the candy bar, which contained [[Purgenol]], a chemical that amplifies a person's violent tendencies. Rick convinces Morty that, despite what happened the previous night, nothing about who he was has changed. As Rick throws his candy bar in the back seat, the candy bar's wrapper faces up, revealing a sticker that reads \""Now Purgenol-Free\"".\n\nIn the post-credits scene, [[Beth Smith|Beth]] asks Jerry why their phone bill is $700 and inquires as to what \""Taddy Mason, L.L.C.\"" stands for. Soon, a Taddy Mason commercial plays on the television, which explains that it is a dial-a-friend pay service with a callback option. Beth soaks in this information while Jerry tries in desperation to shut off their television. After he finally unplugs the T.V., Beth bluntly tells Jerry to \""get a job\""."

A \""Courier Flap\"" arrives, an organism servicing as an intergalactic mail service, with Birdperson's invitation to his wedding to Tammy on [[Planet Squanch]]. Rick immediately declines, saying that weddings always make people miserable (or, in his words, \""funerals with cake\""). While Beth attempts to convince Rick to attend his friend's special event, Jerry manages to be accidentally transported via the courier to the planet, forcing a reluctant Rick to bring the rest of the family to the wedding.\n\nThe family arrives with [[Squanchy]] greeting them, and the Smith Family (minus Rick) mingle with the numerous guests; Jerry unsuccessfully tries to joke with Tammy's parents, Beth inquires about Rick with Birdperson, who discloses vague and dark parts of his and Rick's past, and Morty protests to Rick about opening up more and enjoying the wedding.\n\n[[File:TammyAgent.png|thumb|Tammy reveals herself as a Galactic Federation agent.]]\nBirdperson and Tammy are wed, and Rick reluctantly follows Morty's advice to open up by giving an ad-libbed wedding toast about love and his happiness the newly married couple. Unfortunately, the happiness ends when the bride reveals herself to be a deep undercover [[Galactic Federation]] agent, and that the building is surrounded by officers. When the reception erupts into chaos, Birdperson is shot multiple times and seemingly killed, much to Rick's horror. As the majority of the criminals attending the wedding are gunned down, Rick is about to use his portal gun when Tammy ambushes him and holds him at gunpoint, ordering him to give up the gun. He does so, although he also wires it to kill several Galactic Federation officers and explode before it is able to be recovered. Consequently, the explosion also renders Tammy temporarily deaf. As the final few shots are fired from those still living, Squanchy provides a diversion for the family to escape by drinking a potion and turning into a large warrior, temporarily fighting off the surviving Galactic Federation goons and avenging many of his allies' deaths.\n\nFollowing the chaos at the wedding, an angered Rick reveals that he is vehemently against the Federation, enough to join forces with the late Birdperson and other like-minded rebels. Despite Beth's suggestion to return home, Rick points out that option is no longer possible, as Earth will be the first place for the Federation to look for him. He even goes as far as to say that if any of them were to go home themselves, they could be interrogated despite not knowing where Rick might escape to.\n\nInstead, he suggests finding a new world to live in. Upon asking his computer, he finds out that there are 765 planets similar to Earth in the Milky Way with only 3 existing outside federal jurisdiction. They find a very similar Earth-like planet but also find that it is incredibly small. They then find a much larger planet where everything from the plants to even the animal life is \""on a cob\"". However, Rick panics from this discovery and quickly takes everyone back out. The last Federation-free planet seems almost perfect (and \""cob-free\""), until they discover a sun that screams endlessly throughout the planet's 42-hour day. With only this and the small Earth as their only options, they decide to return to the small Earth.\n\nWhile hiding on the small Earth, the Smiths learn from a news broadcast that the Federation have occupied Earth in an attempt to find them, and ultimately Rick. As Rick explores a cave leading under the house, he overhears the rest of his family arguing about what to do with their predicament. Jerry suggests turning Rick in, with the main reason of him caring about no one but himself. Everyone else, especially Beth, are willing to put up with Rick's antics and sacrifice their current and future lives on earth so they don't have to lose him, with Summer arguing that you don't love someone in the hopes of a reward and Morty reiterating Birdperson's response to him seeking to abandon Rick during the Armageddon, refuting Jerry by convicting that the family will stick beside Rick even if he wouldn't do the same for them. Upon hearing his family defend him and Beth eventually break down and emotionally confess that she is scared of being abandoned by him again, Rick realizes that despite treating his family badly in the past, they're willing to sacrifice their lives and futures on earth to be with him. This causes him to guiltily reflect on the fact that he's a selfish and destructive person, eventually leading him to have a defining moment in which he decides to turn himself in to the Galactic Federation. Saying goodbye to Morty under the guise of an ice cream run, he flies to a nearby cantina to await his own arrest. En route to the cantina, Rick poses as Jerry to tip off the Galactic Federation on where Rick can be found while asking for his family to be spared where it turns out that the Smiths are not wanted by the Federation.\n\nThe Smiths are escorted back to Earth, now a [[Galactic Federation]] protectorate. Jerry is happy when a robotic agent tells him to report to the employment office to be \""assigned a function\"" in order to pay off a debt of 7,000 credits for antidepressant pills, although Morty and the rest of the family seem ill at ease.\n\nRick is booked and incarcerated in a maximum-security Federation prison, seemingly without bail or parole. A fellow prisoner asks him what he did. \""Everything,\"" Rick glumly replies.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] is seen in his apartment watching the show, breaking the 4th wall. He turns off the set, limps over to a table, and, while chipperly addressing the viewers, swallows an inordinate amount of painkillers, noting they are to treat the lingering pain from when Beth shot him in ''[[Total Rickall]]''. He then pesters a pizza delivery guy at the door about the show and what his favorite part was, but the delivery man has no idea what he is talking about. Mr. Poopybutthole then tells the viewers to tune in to [[Season 3|Season Three]] to see what how the \""mess\"" Rick is in unravels."

Rick smells a rat and orders\u00a0[[Jerry Smith (Replacement dimension)|Jerry]]\u00a0to fold himself over 12 times. \""Jerry\"" only manages to contort himself into six folds, revealing that this is, in fact, a simulation based on Rick's memories.\n[[file:S3e1 mature rick.png|left|thumb|Mature, Rick.]]\n\nA\u00a0[[Galactic Federation]]\u00a0agent named [[Cornvelious Daniel]] sitting in the next booth introduces himself and reveals that he has been sent to gather information from Rick's mind via a [[Series 9000 Brainalyzer|brain-link]]. The agent makes it clear that Rick's brain will be liquefied at the end of the session, so he might as well revisit his memories one last time.\n\n[[file:S3e1 summer an gun rain.png|thumb|Summer finds the portal gun.]]\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0[[Morty]]\u00a0and his family are back on Earth, which is now being run by the Galactic Federation. Jerry now works\u00a0an unspecified occupation, while Beth has lost her own job due to the Federation's advanced medical knowledge. Unhappy with their current way of life, [[Summer Smith|Summer]] decides to save Rick and digs up the [[Portal Gun|portal gun]] buried by Rick in the backyard next to his own alternate-dimension corpse. Morty tries to dissuade Summer from doing so, but when the family's robot butler [[Conroy]] turns hostile and attempts to confiscate the portal gun, Morty transports them all to his\u00a0\""[[Rick Potion 9|Cronenberg World]]\""\u00a0family, which he and Rick C-137 abandoned previously.\n\n[[file:S3e1 cronen fam.png|left|thumb|Morty's original family, and his replacement Summer in the background.]]\n\nAfter they arrive, Conroy is destroyed by [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry Smith]] and [[Summer Smith (C-137)|Summer Smith]] from the abandoned [[Cronenberged dimension]]. Morty and Summer join them, along with [[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth Smith]], in a feast of roasted [[Cronenbergs|Cronenberg]]. The cataclysm endured by this dimension affords Morty the proof to Summer that Rick does not care about anyone, especially his family. At this point, Jerry smashes the portal gun, preventing our Summer and Morty from leaving.\n\n[[file:S3e1 trial.png|thumb|A sham trial.]]\n\nAgents from the\u00a0[[Council of Ricks]]\u00a0show up to investigate the compromised portal gun, immobilizing Jerry, Beth, and the other Summer with a freeze ray. As Summer informs the agents that Rick C-137 has been captured, the agents dispatch a [[Seal Team Rick|Rick Council Seal Team]] to assassinate Rick C-137, while Summer and Morty are captured. At the subsequent kangaroo court aboard the [[Citadel of Ricks]], our Summer and Morty speak out against the council in Rick C-137's defense, and Morty reveals that he never gave up on Rick and was just trying to protect his sister from the dangers of life with Rick involved.\n\n[[file:S3e1 beth and diane surprised.png|thumb|left|Beth and Diane.]]\n\nBack in the brain-link simulation, Rick stops by a McDonalds drive-thru, and orders Chicken McNuggets with [[Szechuan Chicken McNugget Sauce|Szechuan sauce]]. Rick then shows the agent a memory of how he lost his [[Diane Sanchez|wife]] and [[Beth Sanchez (C-137)|Beth]] to an explosion in his first [[Dimension C-137|dimension]], driving him to [[Portal Technology|invent]] his first portal gun. The agent collects what he believes to be the genuine portal gun formula and uploads it to the brain-link server. The agent then attempts to leave the brain-link, but his communication device fails. Rick reveals that the \""code\"" given was actually a virus giving him control of the entire system and that the \""memory\"" they visited was a \""fabricated\"" origin story. Rick then transfers his consciousness out of the brain-link into the physical body of the agent.\n\nAt this point, the Rick Council Seal Team shows up and kills all of the aliens and [[Rick Sanchez (D-99)|Rick D-99]], a SEAL Team Member shoots Rick C-137\u2019s old body in the head, destroying it. Rick manages to transfer his consciousness from his agent body to Rick D-99. Quickly afterward, another SEAL Team Rick shoots the agent body, killing Rick D-99. Rick C-137 (in his new body) kills the rest of the agents and interrogates a surviving Rick, which the surviving Rick tells him that Morty and Summer are on the Citadel. Rick thanks the last surviving Rick and shoots him in the head.\u00a0\n\n[[file:S3e1 terror rick.png|thumb|Rick transports the Citadel into the Galactic Federation Prison.]]\n\nRick rappels up a rope and leaves the Galactic Federation Prison and makes his way to the teleportation control room of the Citadel of Ricks by switching his consciousness into a high ranking Rick. He teleports the entire Citadel back into the middle of the federation prison, resulting in a heated battle between the two sides. Rick C-137 infiltrates the Council chamber and kills most of the Council of Ricks before ending up in a standoff with the final member, attempting to use Summer as a hostage.\n\nWith a clever bit of trickery, Rick and Morty combine efforts to save Summer and escape back to Earth, but not before Rick returns to the prison's control room and changes the Galactic Federation's currency, [[Blemflarck]]s, so that 1 blemflarck is worth 0 blemflarcks. With the economy in shambles, the Federation follows suit, sending the whole galaxy into chaos and resulting in many aliens leaving Earth.\n\n[[file:S3e1 him or me.png|left|thumb|Rick or Jerry.]]\n\nBy the time Rick, Morty and Summer return home, [[Jerry Smith (replacement dimension)|Jerry]] is once again unemployed while [[Beth]] is simply relieved that her family is home safe and sound.

By eliminating Jerry, Rick now takes on the role as the undisputed patriarch of the family, and Morty will be forced to continue on adventures with him as both Beth and Summer view Rick as a hero. Rick explains that all he wants out of all his plans is to get [[Szechuan Chicken McNugget Sauce]], which was discontinued by McDonalds years ago.

As Jerry pathetically stands outside the house, the wind quietly calls him a loser.\n\n[[file:S3e2 kill me please.png|thumb|left|The leader begs Summer to kill him, to which she coldly agrees to.]]\nRick's portal takes him and his grandchildren to a diesel-fueled post-apocalyptic Earth, filled with dieselpunk cars, shotguns, mutants, and cannibals. Rick's main goal is to retrieve the powerful Isotope-322, but the adventure is sidetracked by Summer becoming enamored by this dimension, killing the leader of the [[Death Stalkers]] and forming an alliance with them. Though Rick and Morty initially want to go home, Rick sees the Death Stalkers have a large rock-form of Isotope-322 and decides to stick around so he can steal it.\n\n[[file:S3e2 rip scalp.png|thumb|Morty is not handling his parents' divorce well.]]\nWhile Summer goes off to kill some people, Rick tries to get Morty to make a distraction by being a ringer in the Thunderdome (or Blood Dome, as the Death-Stalkers call it). Rick inserts a serum that extracts muscle memory from body parts into Morty's arm to give him combat skills, but \""muscle memory\"" apparently includes the memories and personality of said body-parts, giving Morty a left arm with enormous strength that punches Rick before beating up and killing various Death Stalkers in the Blood Dome. Though Morty initially does this against his will, he soon begins venting his frustrations against Jerry for agreeing to the divorce through the arm. Rick tries to get Morty and Summer to leave before the Death-Stalkers notice someone stole the Isotope-322, and Morty's arm reveals the theft, forcing Rick to pull out his [[laser gun]], telling the viewer that they will be right back. \n\n[[file:S3e2 summer rick and morty driving.png|thumb|left|Summer and Morty chase Rick.]]\nThe episode continues with Rick being chased by his grandchildren in separate cars. He tries to convince them that they are merely staying in the world because they do not want to confront their parents' divorce, but ultimately gives up and portals back to his garage, leaving Morty and Summer trapped (albeit willingly) with the Death Stalkers.\n\n[[file:S3e2 intern.png|thumb|Summer and Hemorrhage hook up.]]\nWhile in the Blood Dome, Morty's arm recognizes a soldier who killed his wife and children before torturing him, and proceeds to chase him away from the Blood Dome and kills him.

Meanwhile, Summer strikes up a romantic relationship with the new leader of the Death Stalkers, a guy with a bucket on his head named [[Hemorrhage]].\n\nWanting to hide their absence from Beth, Rick builds some Morty and Summer robots to both fool and cheer Beth up, but they only succeed in making her cry and leaving to call Jerry.\n\n[[file:S3e2 choke a b.png|thumb|left|left|Armothy's unfinished business.]]\nMorty and his arm, now dubbed \""Armothy,\"" prepare to take revenge on the soldier's boss.

He starts to choke the man to death just as Rick arrives to retrieve him, admitting it would be too much trouble to find a different Morty and Summer to cheer up Beth.

Three weeks later, the post-apocalypse has turned into something resembling modern-day suburbia, with Summer stuck in an unfulfilling marriage with Hemorrhage-- one resembling that of Jerry and Beth's. \n\n[[file:S3e2 lets just go home.png|thumb|left|Summer's ready to leave.]]\n\nFrustrated, Summer agrees to return to her Earth with Rick and Morty, realizing Rick had planned the whole thing to teach her there was no running from her problems at home.

He follows the voice to the garage to find that Rick has turned himself into a pickle \""because he could.\"" Beth and Summer appear and notice Rick's pickle status as well. Morty suspects that Rick did this to avoid going to the therapy session, noticing a dangling syringe rigged to inject Rick the moment the others leave. Rick denies the idea of getting out of going and claims the syringe to be irrelevant. In response, Beth removes the syringe, puts it in her purse, and leaves with her children.\n\nNow alone on the table, Rick starts making random sounds when a cat named Izzy appears. Rick tells the cat to back off stating that he has seen Youtube videos with cats attacking pickles because cats are afraid of snakes and think pickles are snakes. The cat knocks Rick over, pushing him outside of the garage and exposing Rick to the sun. Rick grudgingly states how dying in a pickle-form from the heat is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet. Fortunately, a timely rain shower saves him from that fate.\n\n[[file:S3e3 rick falling into sewer.png|thumb|Rick falls into the sewers.]]\n\nHowever, the resulting rush of water flushes Rick into the sewer drain forcing him to survive in the sewers. Rick creates a bit of pickle juice and lures a cockroach towards him. The cockroach is killed by Rick with a bite to the head and he removes part of the cockroach's head. Rick uses the brain of the cockroach to propel himself forward.\n\nAt the counseling office, we learn that the therapy session has been advised by the school, for Summer huffing pottery enamel and Morty wetting his pants in class, both believed to be signs of protesting their parents' divorce. Mr. Goldenfold runs into them on his way out: he was in for eating poop and asks the others if they're in for the same. Beth, Summer, and Morty are greeted by Dr. Wong, the therapist, and their therapy session begins. Beth talks about how Rick couldn't attend and how he is a genius. Morty blurts out that Rick turned himself into a pickle. Dr. Wong uses this idea to start a discussion about why Rick turned himself into a pickle.\n\n[[file:S3e3 rick set up.png|thumb|left|\""OH YEAH!\"" Rick's disgusting suit of rats parts.]]\n\nRick is seen cutting a sewer grate using a makeshift exo-suit of decapitated roaches. As he is pondering his next move (to a sewer line), a sewer rat appears and tries to attack Rick. Rick uses an elaborate trap to decapitate the unwary rodent. Rick then taunts the other rats that arrived and puts the dead rat's head on top of another contraption, creating a rat version of an exo-suit. The sewer bars break open with the rats pouring in and Rick begins to kill every rat in sight with various small items, including screws and box-cutters.\n\n[[file:S3e3 Mooom.png|thumb|\""MOM!\"" Beth continues to be both in denial and uncooperative.]]\n\nInside the counseling office, Beth talks about how Rick is important. Summer replies back and says how Rick lied and turned himself into a pickle avoid the counseling session. Beth yells that Rick did not. Dr. Wong notices how the use of science is a common form of communication for the family and discusses this. Dr. Wong asks what could be inside the syringe with them replying it's a liquid that can change Rick back into a human. Beth disagrees and gets angry. She flips out and delivers f-bombs to both Dr. Wong and the siblings.\n\n[[file:S3e3 hero pose.png|thumb|left|Rick lands in the hero pose.]]\n\nRick has just killed the largest and toughest rat and enters the sewer pipe using rockets. He lands out of a toilet and exultantly yells, \""PICKLE RIIICK!\"" He leaves the men's bathroom and begins to search for an exit. He stumbles upon an elevator and moves some nearby objects to allow himself to parkour towards the elevator door button.\n\n[[file:S3e3 recycling shaming.png|thumb|A pickle shames them for not recycling.]]\n\nRick is approached by some agents who speak Russian and begin shooting at Rick. Rick runs into a room and starts building weapons with office supplies. Rick taunts the Agency Director of the building while killing all the agents using traps bombs and a laser gun. The Agency Director uses a last resort method and calls upon a captured fighter named [[Jaguar]] to kill Rick.\n\nBack in therapy, Dr. Wong asks what is in the syringe with Beth replying that Dr. Wong should say it, while the siblings say it is anti-pickle serum. Dr. Wong talks about the serum with Beth cutting her off. Beth talks about how the session is supposed to be about the siblings being angry that she divorced Jerry. Morty starts to notice interesting features of the therapy room, particularly how there is a book displaying people eating feces. Dr. Wong says she isn't going to take sides and states that Beth admires Rick. Beth blatantly says it is better than making other peoples' problems, which Dr. Wong questions if that is the reason she looks up to him.\n\n[[file:S3e3 staple pickle.png|thumb|left|\""OW\"" Rick staples on a pickle slice to treat his wound.]]\n\nRick and Jaguar begin fighting, leading to them both becoming wounded and treating their injuries, leading to them both talking about their motives. Rick proceeds to destroy all the cameras while fighting Jaguar. The Agency Director receives a call from Rick, saying \""Jaguar couldn't make it\"", with Rick remarking that he'll hunt down the Agency Director. The Agency Director offers 100 million dollars in bonds but Rick demands it be given to Jaguar's daughter when she's set free. The Agency Director says she's dead, and Rick refuses to reason with the Agency Director, who then kills the two remaining guards and flees to the roof to get to a helicopter.\n\n[[file:S3e3 look up defeated.png|thumb|The director looks up defeated.]]\n\nThe helicopter flies away with Jaguar steering it and Rick, using a cigarette, creates an explosion that kills the Agency Director. Jaguar and Rick talk about their families, to which Jaguar ends by leaving. Jaguar is seen in a comic style flash ending.\n\nThe family is seen using simple sentences to describe what they currently want: Summer and Morty admit that Summer's sniffing enamel and Morty's desk wetting have nothing to do with the divorce: one is just for getting high and the other is a mere accident.\n\n[[file:S3e3 wong explains.png|thumb|left|The wonderful Dr. Wong lays down some facts.]]\n\nRick appears, badly injured, and joins them, asking Beth for the serum that will, indeed, turn him back into a human. Rick says he turned himself into a pickle because he doesn't respect therapy, and therefore, didn't want to go, claiming therapy is for boring people and he does not need it. Dr. Wong agrees that going to therapy, or rather taking the time to repair relationships with your family, is boring, but boring in the way that brushing your teeth or performing bathroom hygiene is not an adventure: there's no way to do it in a way that you can die, it is just about putting in work, and that perhaps some people would rather die than put in the work. Rick has no retort to this, and the session ends.\n\n[[file:S3e3 truly awful parental units.png|thumb|Summer and Morty are ignored by some truly terrible parents.]]\n\nOn the ride home, Rick apologizes to Beth for lying to her and Beth responds by injecting him with the syringe, finally turning him back into a human. Rick and Beth plan to go get a drink after dropping the siblings off while ignoring Summer and Morty asking if they'll ever go back to therapy.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Rick and Morty are tied up on a giant piano and are about to be killed by Concerto. Rick says how he is sorry for getting Morty into this situation and believes that they will definitely die. Unpredictably, Jaguar appears, kills Concerto, and leaves. Morty asks who that was and Rick replies, \""That Morty, is why you don't go to therapy\""."

A crystal on the shelf starts to glow and Morty points out that it is [[the Vindicators]] calling to help save the universe again for what appears to be the second time. Rick outright refuses to answer an actual [[wikipedia:Hero's_journey#The_Call_to_Adventure|call to adventure]], but ultimately relents because Morty brings up the fact that he gets to pick every tenth adventure.\n[[file:S3e4 explain worldender.png|thumb|Supernova briefs all on Worldender.]]\n\nRick and Morty are then seen sitting at a conference table getting briefed by [[Supernova]] on the threat of [[Worldender]]. Rick ends up heckling them at first then introduces every member of the Vindicators there except for [[Vance Maximus]] Renegade Star Soldier, who then shows up and seemingly charms everyone except Rick. \n\nIt is then revealed that this is actually the third time the Vindicators had assembled and that they didn't invite Rick and Morty the second time due to a \""personality conflict\"" with Rick and the rest of the Vindicators, which resulted in the deaths of three members of the Vindicators ([[Lady Katana]], [[Calypso]], and [[Diablo Verde]]).\n\n[[file:S3e4 diarrhea everywhere.png|thumb|left|Rick on the conference room table.]]\n\nRick then gets blackout drunk and we next see him pantsless and having gotten diarrhea all over the conference table the following morning. This mess is left to be cleaned up by [[Noob Noob]] instead of him going on the mission with the rest of the Vindicators. Then, Vance gives Morty a Vindicators vest as to symbolize he is a welcomed member of the Vindicators.\n\n[[file:S3e4 ta da.png|thumb|Rick easily bypasses the machine guns.]]\n\nInside Worldender's base, the Vindicators get through the traps, then into Worldender's main room. It is then revealed that Worldender is already dying/dead and Rick then tries to leave with Morty. But then, all of the Vindicators are trapped inside of the room, as set up by Rick when he was blackout drunk. It is revealed that \""Drunk Rick\"" set up a Saw-like sequence where the Vindicators are forced to play games to survive or they all die.\n\n[[file:S3e4 triggered.png|thumb|left|Vance, angered about getting Sawed]]\n\nFollowing a nervous breakdown, Vance then attempts to escape, only to be shot, burned and bisected in the ventilation system in a gruesome death. Morty then solves the puzzle, matching the Vindicators with Rick's opinion of them: Unoriginal.\n\n[[File:S3e4 dorian 5.png|thumb|Crocubot picks out Dorian 5.]]\nIn the next room, Drunk Rick asks the Vindicators to locate a place they would never mention. [[Crocubot]] then goes to the hologram map of the universe to point out [[Dorian 5]]. However, he is wrong and crushed to death. Dorian 5 is revealed to have been a planet destroyed (along with its populace) by the Vindicators to defeat Doom-nometron, a shapeshifter hiding on the planet during the Vindicators 2 mission. Rick stated that if they just brought him along, he could have created a machine to find Doom-nometron in a second. Morty then goes up to the map and locates Israel, the correct answer, as Morty knows that when Rick is blackout drunk, he rants about the United Nations and defense budgets, to which Rick defends isn't because he's anti-semitic.\n\n[[File:S3e4_more_death.png|thumb|left|A domestic argument.]]\n\nIn the next room they need to make 5 three-pointers in 5 minutes or else a neutrino bomb will blow up the planet. Morty goes to defuse the bomb, which is revealed to happen a lot more than Rick knew about, while the Vindicators work on scoring three-pointers. During this, Supernova, [[Million Ants]], and [[Alan Rails]] discuss how Supernova and Alan were previously married, and how Supernova cheated on Alan with Million Ants. Alan and Million Ants then begin to fight, Supernova then suspends them in the air and Million Ants kills Alan. Rick makes a smart remark which is the final straw for Supernova who decides to arrest both Rick and Morty.\n\n[[File:S3e4_complaining_about_morty_and_vins.png|thumb|Rick's final monologue.]]\n\nIn the final room, Drunk Rick asks for something he believes the Vindicators have that he wants. It is assumed Drunk Rick is talking about Morty because the Vindicators are heroes to Morty-- and Rick isn't. So Morty steps on the platform and he is taken down into a ride in which it seems Drunk Rick is expressing his love for Morty as his grandson. However, it is revealed the ride was intended for Noob Noob, simply because he laughed at Rick's jokes about the Vindicators while Morty was caught up in hero worship.\n\n[[File:S3e4_brutality.png|thumb|left|Supernova betrays [[Million Ants|Snuzzles]]]]\n\nMorty gets back out of the ride (with a look of disgust), and the platform they are on begins to rise. Supernova then goes to kill Rick and Morty for the deaths Drunk Rick caused, to which Million Ants tries to convince Supernova not to do it, only to be killed himself by Supernova.\n\nBefore Supernova can do the same to Rick and Morty, the platform reaches a party with music star [[Logic]] singing a rap song about the Vindicators. Supernova gets away, and when Morty points it out, Rick dismissively says that 20 people try to kill him a week, and he ends up getting high with half of them, pointing out that [[Gearhead]] is there. The latter who takes Morty's Vindicators vest when Morty discards it. Beth and Summer are also at the party along with other previously seen characters. \n\n[[File:S3e4_dabbing_im_dying.png|thumb|Logic hits the dab and it's kek, poggers and wholesome 100]]\n\nAt that point Logic mentions Noob Noob in the rap song, to which Rick asks \""Who the fuck is Noob Noob?\"", causing Morty to show another unpleasant look.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Gearhead is seen with the Vindicators vest trying to pick up some (possible) college girls, But then when an alien terrorist attack strikes, he goes down an alleyway to ditch the vest and run away, before he trips on a pile of gears and is dismantled.\n \n\n\n "

The moment is interrupted by Rick, who asks Morty to go with him on what he promises to be a quick twenty-minute adventure for a crystal. Said adventure goes on for six days and, despite being heroes and Rick getting the crystal, both Morty ''and'' Rick finally break down. Over-stressed from non-stop adventures, Rick finally decides it's time for a vacation.\n\nWhile relaxing at an alien spa, they decide to try out a machine that supposedly removes all the toxicity of its users. Upon use, Rick and Morty find themselves in a toxic wasteland full of disgusting creatures, at first believing the machine blew up the rest of the spa, only for Rick to discover that they aren't the real Rick and Morty: they are ''literally'' the toxicity of themselves, Toxic Rick as the rude, lying, alcoholic, genius asshole part of himself and Toxic Morty being the nervous, pathetic, and self-loathing part of himself. While the real Rick and Morty leave the spa refreshed after their vacation\u2013Rick also has a normal skin color instead of his ''gray-alcoholic'' skin color\u2013Toxic Rick begins plotting a way to get out.\n\nMorty, freed from all his insecurities, suddenly becomes popular and confident in school, helping the self-esteem of almost all of the students and impressing Mr. Goldenfold by openly insulting him in class. He even works up the courage to ask Jessica out, which she happily accepts. However, Rick reveals to Morty he started receiving strange signals on his phone that he traced back to the spa and upon further investigation discovered what actually happened to their removed toxicity. Though Morty tells him to ignore it, Rick feels obligated to re-merge with his toxicity as he removed the part of himself that would not care, thus he does care that they accidentally created life.\n\nMorty's date with Jessica does not go well, as Jessica is thrown off by Morty's complete openness and seeming inability to stop talking. Morty is fine with it and convinces another girl named Stacy to come home with him. Upon arriving, he learns Rick purchased the machine from the spa and in cooperation with Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty rigged it so they could re-merge with their toxic selves. Morty refuses, claiming that Toxic Rick could be lying, so Rick tries to force him into the machine. However, just as the machine is activated, Morty says an agreed upon \""safe word\"" (Sea Cucumber) and Stacy pulls the two out and takes their place, teleporting her into the tank and replacing her with Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty, who revel in having tricked their real selves until they realize they are all in the same room.\n\nToxic Rick at first continues to try to get Rick into the toxic tank, but eventually resolves to make the whole world toxic instead, using a Moon Tower to transmit the toxicity around the planet. At first Rick refuses to stop them, saying it's not his place to decide which dimensions are saved or destroyed, but upon getting slapped by Morty, he realizes that the detox machine removes toxicity in a user based on that person's definition of toxicity. Toxic Rick manages to turn the world toxic, driving it to total depravity and violence, just as Rick and Morty arrive. Rick realized that his normal self considered his irrational attachments to people toxic, thus he knows Toxic Rick cares too much about Morty to allow him to die: with this knowledge, he shoots Toxic Morty with a nanobotic virus that will destroy him in twenty minutes, cutting that time in half with each progressive shot until an agonized Toxic Rick finally agrees to re-merge with him. Restored to his former self, Rick turns off the toxicity beam and restores the world, but Morty flies away with a jetpack to avoid having to re-merge with his toxic self. Rick is left shocked that he didn't expect this.\n\nThree weeks later, Morty has become a ''Wolf of Wall Street''-esque salesman in New York and living an altogether healthy lifestyle with his attractive girlfriend Jacqueline. While at his apartment he receives a call from Jessica begging him to come back, which he knows is part of Rick's plan to trace his location. However, he does not manage to hang up in time, and Rick and Jessica track him down. Using a group of drones to tie Morty down, Rick forcibly re-inserts the boy's toxicity, turning him back into his miserable self. While Rick and Jessica argue over who actually wanted regular Morty back, Morty amicably breaks up with Jacqueline. He offers her the apartment and the drones. However, Rick refuses to give up the latter because he loves their ability to form a Voltron-like combination.\n\nMirroring the opening scene, Morty listens to Jessica talking about going out with Brad again, which she insists was not a date but her friends claim is proof they are back together. Just as Rick drags Morty into another adventure, Jessica stops him and lets him know she's glad to have him back.\n\nIn the after-credits scene, a tour visits the Moon Tower and discovers the tank. Upon turning it on, Stacy is teleported back into the real world, screaming the safe word from earlier in the episode."

Our Rick and Morty refute the possibility of donation with hostility, pointing out that our Rick was the one to destroy it in the first place, and the pair leave.\n\nThe scene then cuts to show a fully-fledged, well-developed Citadel, which has extended beyond being a mere government into the territory of being a (mostly) functional society consisting only of Ricks and Mortys. The Citadel makes quick work of recuperating from Rick's attempted destruction of it, with workers restructuring its foundation, commuters proceeding with their work and an election going on. Contention surrounds the fact that a Morty has decided to run a political campaign, with the news anchor Ricks sardonically and aggressively defaming him on the news, leading [[Campaign Manager Morty]] to suggest that [[President Morty|Candidate Morty]] withdraw from the race. Despite this, Candidate Morty refuses.\n\nMeanwhile, a Morty Pride rally/protest is occurring on the streets. Here, a newly recruited [[Cop Rick]], while standing outside the [[Cafe Sanchez]], is surprised to discover that he has been paired with a jaded and critical [[Cop Morty]], who possesses anti-Morty sentiments and tasers any Morty that gets close to his car, calling them slurs such as \""yellow-shirts\"", (much to the surprise of Cop Rick). Despite being called out, Cop Morty digresses that no one cares about broken codes or corruption. The pair are called to attend to a robbery committed in \""Mortytown,\"" a ghetto populated by Mortys who, for some reason or another, were deemed unsuitable for pairing with another Rick.\n\nWhile this occurs, a Morty school is in session, where Mortys are being educated on how to act for when they are <span style=\""font-weight:400;\"">been</span> reassigned a new Rick. After the lesson, they are told they will graduate and be assigned a new Rick the following day. Hearing this, [[Lizard Morty]], [[Glasses Morty]] and [[Left-Handed Morty]] (Left Hand Morty) are encouraged by [[Slick Morty]] to make the most of their small amount of time left together by going to the \""wishing portal\"". The four eventually agree to embark on the journey together.\n\nAs this takes place, a [[Simple Rick\u2019s Wafer Cookie factory|factory]] producing Simple Rick's wafers (wafers doused in the psychic resonance of Simple Rick and his memory of having spent time with a young [[Beth Smith|Beth]] on her birthday), the Rick who would later become the Factory Terrorick ([[Rick J-22]]) is passed by for a promotion in favor of [[Cool Rick]] (K-83).\n\nMeanwhile, Cop Rick and Cop Morty arrive in Mortytown to investigate the reported robbery, where Cop Rick learns more about the resident Mortys and what conditions they live with. The pair question the Morty Mart Manager Morty, who describes the robbers' appearances as four normal-looking Mortys. Whilst Cop Rick attempts to attain more information, Cop Morty uses his Morty-like nature to attempt to get some insider information from some vandalizing Mortys. After the vandalizing Mortys criticize him on his uniform and his relation to Rick, Cop Morty snaps, forcefully interrogating them and learning that a group called the \""Mortytown Locos\"" were the ones who committed the crime. Cop Rick, shocked at Cop Morty's violation of codes, is ordered to get back into the car.\n\nDuring this, the Presidential Election Campaign has commenced, with the candidate Ricks all providing their own solutions to issues currently surrounding the Citadel. When the time comes for Politician Morty to offer his solution to the social divide between Ricks and Mortys, he is mocked by his rivals. However, he answers with clarity and delivers the conclusion that the great divide is a result of the death of the Citadel, and that the main solution is recognizing how there are many Ricks and Mortys who believe in the Citadel's prosperity and success, as opposed to those who don't. As the crowd responds with great applause, Campaign Manager Morty is amazed by Politician Morty's success, to which Politician Morty responds by firing him.\n\nAs Politician Morty delivers his message, Rick J-22 manages to snap in rage, killing the Regional Manager Rick and forcing himself to retreat into the Simple Rick's Factory's Flavor Core with an unconscious Simple Rick, locking the room around him. As he is shown trapped in the room, SWAT Team Ricks begin to swarm the building, attempting to negotiate and rationalize with Rick J-22, but with no success.\n\nAs Campaign Manager Morty watches the event unfold on the TV from a bar, the news coverage switches back towards the highly-likely victory for Politician Morty and his speeches. Displaying his negative feelings of the situation, Campaign Manager Morty is then confronted by [[Investigator Rick]], who delivers some secret files and warns him that he should be fearful of what is to come.\n\nIn Mortytown, the Mortytown Locos are also watching the same speeches, as Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick is attempting to create Bootleg Portal Fluid for inter-dimensional transport. At the same time, Cop Rick and Cop Morty break down the door, apprehending three of the Mortytown Locos. [[Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick]] attempts to escape through his own portal fluid, only to be killed due to issues of its bootleg-nature. Cop Rick then scouts around upstairs to find the fourth member of the Mortytown Locos, who plays with Rick's sympathy and stabs him in the shoulder. Rick quickly shoots the fourth member, and Cop Morty comforts Rick, saying that it is alright to put your faith in Mortys, but only the right ones. As Rick leaves to get medical treatment, Cop Morty then destroys the building.\n\nMeanwhile, Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, Slick Morty, and Left-Handed Morty attempt to take some mega fruit, only to be chased off into a stream by an angry Mega Fruit Farmer Rick and his robot dog. As time turns to night, the group then gather around a campfire, where they converse over their wishes. Slick Morty, however, presents negative, dramatic opinion, causing Glasses Morty to comfort him by clarifying that he is more than just a dramatic person.\n\nWhilst this occurs, Politician Morty leaves ''Hard Rick'' Cafe to a large crowd of Ricks and Mortys who are excited over his recent statements. Within this crowd, Politician Morty spots his former Campaign Manager Morty and asks about his job search. Campaign Manager Morty states his new job is to assassinate Politician Morty as he pulls a gun from his jacket and shoots Politician Morty, causing him to bleed and lose consciousness. Campaign Manager Morty is then swiftly tasered by a Secret Service Rick, causing him to be apprehended.\n\nFollowing their recent handling of the Mortytown Locos, Cop Morty takes Cop Rick to a club called The Creepy Morty, where he meets [[Big Morty]], a drug-lord who presents Cop Rick and Cop Morty with money for their efforts. Cop Rick, having moral issues with this action, attempts to make an arrest of Big Morty, but causes a shootout in the club. During this shootout, Cop Morty tackles Big Morty to the ground, ready to kill. However, Cop Rick attempts to get Cop Morty to do the right thing, knowing he is capable of doing so. Cop Morty attempts to play with Rick's sympathy, only to end Big Morty by surprise, but Rick expected it this time and kills him before he can turn on him. Cop Rick leaves the club, where he surrenders to the other police officers over the death of the many Mortys in the club.\n\nMeanwhile, Rick J-22's negotiation for a working portal gun seemingly succeeds, causing the SWAT Team Ricks to deliver him a portal gun. Rick J-22 then awakens Simple Rick from his long unconscious state and sends him through the portal first, revealing that the dimension the portal gun was set to was the [[Blender Dimension]] and leads to Simple Rick's death. As he holds no leverage, the SWAT team finally cut a hole in the door to rush in, only to be stopped by [[Rick D. Sanchez III]], who sympathizes with Rick J-22, letting him go free. However, as he is set free, a narrative voice appears again, revealing that Rick J-22's attempted escape is just a replaying memory which the company is feeding off of to create their new product.\n\nLizard Morty, Glasses Morty, Slick Morty, and Left-Handed Morty all manage to get to the Wishing Portal, where they all throw something of value to them in return for a wish. Left-Handed Morty throws in his panini maker, wishing for a million sandwiches, while also acknowledging the irony of his wish. Lizard Morty throws in his surfer necklace, wishing for something better in return. Glasses Morty throws in a piece of technology, wishing for incest porn to be more mainstream. However, Slick Morty becomes sad and expresses his wish for life to change for Mortys, ultimately throwing himself into the portal. It is then later revealed that the portal is part of a garbage dump.\n\nMeanwhile, Campaign Manager Morty is thrown into an airlock chamber by Secret Service Ricks, revealing to him that his assassination attempt failed and that Politician Morty will become the President of the Citadel. Campaign Manager Morty attempts to warn them that Politician Morty is not who he seems, but the Secret Service Ricks disregard him, sending him out into the vacuum of space.\n\nCop Rick is shown in a small interrogation room, ready to accept his punishment, when council members enter, telling him that he is free and none of his actions matter, due to the changes in department codes.\n\nLizard Morty, Glasses Morty, and Left-Handed Morty return to Morty School, only to find Teacher Rick to be locking the doors, revealing that no Ricks will be coming for the graduation and that he is fired, due to changes in the curriculum. The trio believes that Slick Morty's wish came true, where now a new, different life is available for Mortys.\n\nRick D. Sanchez III enters a room with the [[Shadow Council of Ricks]] and the new President Morty. One member of the Council, Garment District Rick, then raises his opinion, stating that it doesn't matter who sits in the president's chair as the Council has, and always will, have control over the Citadel. President Morty, who has his back to them, responds to this by holding up his mirror and having the Ricks raise their hand if they agree with that statement before calling his guards to assassinate those who agreed. President Morty then asks the surviving Ricks, who are all now terrified, if they will obey and they agree.\n\nA montage shows new banners being deployed, Cop Rick going back to work, the trio of Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, and Left-Handed Morty clad in new uniforms and harvesting mega fruits, and the corpses of the council members being dragged into airlock chambers, while President Morty ponders about making a \""cold, calculated speech with sinister overtones\"" about the changes in politics, about order, brotherhood, and power, only to declare that, now that he is elected, the time for speeches is over and he can finally act.\n\nThe dead council members are expelled into space, where they join the floating bodies of many Ricks and Mortys, including Cop Morty, Big Morty, Investigator Rick, and lastly Campaign Manager Morty, shown next to the secret documents which reveal the newly-elected \""President Morty\"" is none other than the former [[President Morty|Eye Patch Morty]] who had controlled [[Evil Rick Sanchez|\""Evil\"" Rick\""]] in \""[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]\"".\n\nIn the post-credit scene, Rick C-137 and his Morty return from their Atlantis adventure, where they boast and recollect about their sexual interactions with the mermaids. Morty asks Rick if he is concerned at all about the Citadel's return, to which he confidently responds that such a place \""will never have any bearing over [their] lives ever again\""."

Escher's painting \""Relativity\"" in which there are stairs all over the place and the rules. Morty is seen holding a turtle-like creature named the \""Truth Tortoise.\"" Morty looks at the Truth Tortoise, despite Rick's warnings, and causes Morty to drop the creature in a void. The place collapses, but not before the duo escapes.\n\nBoth of them arrive to the Smith residence. Rick wants both of them to watch Interdimensional Cable, but Morty complains about the looping memory in his head and asks Rick to erase the memory off his mind. So Rick leads Morty to a secret chamber underneath the garage, which contains various tubes that archives memories Morty wanted Rick to remove. Rick calls them \""Morty's Mind Blowers\"" hence the title, then faces the audience telling them that they will be doing this instead of watching Interdimensional Cable.\n\nMorty asks Rick how long he ever wanted to remove certain memories, and Rick just replies that he wanted to \""ever since your (Morty) mind was blown.\"" Rick grabs a blue tube and nicknames it \""Moon-spiracy\"" just before Rick activates the helmet and places the tube on the hole of the helmet.\n\nThe memory starts off with Morty and a telescope just outside their front lawn. Morty at first admires the American flag planted on the lunar surface before he notices a strange figure standing in a mid-stride walking pose. He then goes and tells his family, but nobody, including Rick, believes him; they suggest that it was merely a smudge on the lens. He then finds out that Mr. Lunas is, in fact, a real person, as he comes to Morty's high school to work as a guidance counselor. Later on, Morty snaps pictures of Lunas, planting an American flag in his yard, and tells Principal Vagina that he thinks Lunas is \""up to something\"" and \""lives on the moon.\"" Vagina takes this as a metaphor for pedophilia and goes outside to the parking lot to confront Lunas, ending in Lunas getting punched in the face. As a result of this accusation, Lunas goes home and commits suicide, which Morty finds out about from the ambulances outside of Lunas' home. Morty later eavesdrops on Lunas' funeral, where it is learned that Lunas served in the Marine Corps, and that \""from a certain angle, some people would say he looked like a smudge.\"" Morty then runs home and sees that there is, in fact, a smudge on his telescope lens, realizing that he inadvertently drove Lunas to kill himself.\n\nMorty ended up inserting memories on his own. He started to remember Beth choosing Summer's life over his, Beth, Summer, and Rick insulting Morty as Voltematron forces himself back into Morty's mouth, Rick killing an animal that helped them find water and having him and Morty enter its guts after confusing Venzenulon 7 with Venzenulon 9, Rick tricking NASA employees into rescuing them so they could replace him and Morty in a menagerie, Morty getting chased by a hoard of squirrels after learning they controlled the world forcing him and Rick to move to a new reality again, Rick sending lambs to the Cosmic Slaughter, Morty having his hand chopped off, Rick hunting Morty as a ghost, Morty's head being attached to Snowball's body, Rick juggling Morty's body parts, Morty being eaten and pooped out by an alien, Mr. Poopybutthole proposing to Morty, etc. Rick also happened to have erased memories from Morty that involved Rick himself getting embarrassed just to secure his own pride.\n\nAfter realizing that Rick also took away memories without Morty asking or even wanting him to, Morty gets enraged and attacks Rick, pinning him to the floor. Rick manages to use the mind eraser on Morty, but Morty turns the tables and points the device at Rick while it's still being used. This causes them to not remember each other. Trying to find out who they are, Morty uses the helmet and goes through many more traumatic memories until he snaps and decides to kill himself over it, while Rick joins in as part of the suicide pact.\n\nSummer enters as Rick and Morty have guns to their own heads. When Rick doesn't remember her, Summer quickly realizes the situation. She reveals that Rick had a contingency plan should this happen (and has used it several times before) and tranquilizes them, restores both of their memories and drags them to the living room. Rick and Morty wake up on the couch. They believe that they slept through an entire \""Interdimensional Cable\"" episode as Rick questions how that even happened. The two then hurl verbal abuse at Summer and decide to head off on another adventure. Summer moans that this is the reason the two are \""''constantly fighting and behind schedule''\"".\n\nIn the post-credits scene Jerry shows up in Rick's garage and discovers a box containing \""[[Jerry's Mind Blowers]]\"" where, in a twisted homage to ''E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial'', he discovers he accidentally left an alien to die in his car."

[[Rick]] then gets offended and reveals her \""imaginary world\"" was actually one of his inventions created for her to play in. Beth realizes this means that Tommy might actually still be trapped in there and enters the realm with Rick. As Beth argues with Rick about spending her childhood in the \""glorified chicken coop\"" instead of by his side, Rick is captured and nearly fed to the offspring of a giant bird-like creature, losing an arm in the process.\n\nAfter fighting off the bird and her babies using a new mechanical arm, Rick and Beth discover that the lifeforms have been created and corrupted using human DNA, indicating that Tommy is indeed still trapped in the dimension. Beth theorizes that Tommy committed intercourse with the Froopyland creatures in order to produce children of which he would consume in order to sustain himself and Rick adds that it is also likely that the less appetizing of them (for Tommy) would worship Tommy as their god. Rick's assumption is revealed to be true once the two are captured by a group of Tommy's children (human/Froopyland creature hybrids). Upon being captured and brought before Tommy, they learn (to no surprise) that he has become the dimension's de facto leader and commits incest with his children as well as cannibalism to survive, just as Rick and Beth figured out. However, Tommy reveals in a play that ''Beth'' was the one responsible for trapping him in Froopyland, out of jealousy for his own father. Following the play, Tommy decides to give a \""demonstration\"" on how he nourishes himself in Froopyland, to which Rick responds out of disgust by quickly leaving with Beth in tow.\n\nWhen Beth asserts that their \""adventure\"" is not over, Rick tries to justify keeping Beth in Froopyland for most of her childhood by saying that she was \""a scary fucking kid\"" that frequently asked him to make borderline, if not blatantly, psychotic toys and devices to use on the neighbors' kids. Beth tries to blame Rick for her actions, claiming that she only did it so Rick would spend more time with her, and she resolves to save Tommy from the dimension. But when she refuses to apologize for trapping him in Froopyland, Tommy refuses to leave and sics his children on her, causing her to go into a defense-induced killing frenzy, during which she presumably kills Tommy. Beth returns with his severed finger and Rick and Beth create an adult clone of Tommy in order to save his father from lethal injection. Pondering her life and finally confronting Rick, Beth discovers she has two options: leave the family to travel the cosmos while Rick replaces her with a clone, or stay with the family and be content with the life she has chosen. Her decision is left ambiguous.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jerry]] begins dating [[Keara]], an alien highly invested in hunting, much to [[Morty]] and [[Summer]]'s dismay. After becoming exhausted on one of their hunting sessions with Keara, Jerry admits to Summer and Morty that he wants to break up with Keara to which the two encourage him to confront her about it. The following day, Summer and Morty find themselves on the run from Keara after Jerry warns them that she wants to kill them. It is then revealed that this is because Jerry claimed that they were trying to end his and Keara's relationship. While trying to kill Morty and Summer, she breaks up with Jerry once he reveals that he also wanted to end their relationship. Afterward, it is revealed she is using him as a rebound to get over a previous ex, much like Jerry was with her.\n\nPost-credit scene: Jerry's answering machine plays messages that detail Keara warning Jerry that her new boyfriend is angry with him, the boyfriend calling and saying he's coming after Jerry, Rick assuring Jerry he killed the alien hunter and then saying he had sex with Keara. Michael, the owner of the antique phone store where Jerry rented his answering machine, also allows Jerry to keep the device, since \""no one uses them anymore and it's only used for exposition on TV shows, anyway\""."

Upon arriving at the White House (via Portal Gun), they agree to do so, though the President once again denies Morty's request for a selfie. After shooting and scaring off the (small) alien creature, Rick and Morty quickly get bored and return home to play more [[Minecraft]]. Unfortunately, the Secret Service has been watching them the entire time, and inform the President that Rick and Morty \""just blew off America.\""\n\nSeeing Rick and Morty at their home via satellite (complete with thermal imaging), an unhappy President calls them on their progress regarding the monster. Rick and Morty lie about their progress, but the President calls their bluff, and an argument erupts over the two's constant law breaking despite saving the world several times. The two cut ties with the President, and in private, he is visibly heartbroken.\n\nMeanwhile, Summer and Beth are shopping, with Beth giving her daughter very good advice on her choices. Summer reacts positively to her mother's new behavior, saying that she couldn't stand her old negative behavior before, as if she's an almost different person. Beth, however, reacts badly to it.\n\nWhen a miniature civilization is discovered in the Amazon rainforest, Rick and Morty travel to Brazil to investigate. At the same time, however, the U.S. Government arrives claiming jurisdiction. When Rick and Morty protest, the President has them arrested and shrinks down to negotiate with the civilization. Once he leaves, Rick and Morty break free of their restraints (made of the fake element \""Sanchezium\"") and quickly escape from being surrounded by pirates, one of the few things Rick fears.\n\nBack at home, Beth continues to question her status as a clone, and calls Rick to confirm it. Though Rick assures her she is not a clone and would kill her clone self should it become aware of the fact, it only fuels her growing paranoia.\n\nUpon arriving at the Mega Gargantuan civilization, the President is disappointed to learn that Rick and Morty have already negotiated a peace treaty with their Presidentress. Once back to his normal size, the President declares war on Rick and Morty, growing even more upset after learning that they had also negotiated a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestine and gave him all the credit.\n\nFollowing the ensuing press conference, The President asks for Rick and Morty's whereabouts, only to discover they have both been patiently waiting inside the Oval Office. Having fulfilled the President's agenda for him, Rick promises to leave for good on the condition that Morty gets a selfie with the President, regardless of his grandson's lack of interest. When the President continues to refuse the request, Rick indirectly kills most of the Secret Service agents surrounding him, culminating in a lengthy battle with the President throughout the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, a desperate Beth turns to Jerry for help with her identity crisis. Jerry does his best by explaining and recreating the moment he first confessed his love for her in vivid detail. Coming to terms with herself and realizing his unconditional love, Beth rekindles her relationship with Jerry.\n\nBack at the White House, Rick finally forces the President to agree to do a selfie with Morty, only to find that his grandson has disappeared. Morty explains over the phone that he stole Rick's Portal Gun, Jerry and Beth are back together, and the whole family has gone into hiding so Rick won't execute her. Dejected, Rick concedes defeat and asks for the President's help in finding his family, promising to leave him alone from then on. Soon enough, Rick locates the Smith family hideout, arriving through the President's portal. After Beth tries to reason with her father, Rick assures her that she is still herself which is his daughter and only arrived to kill Jerry, but ultimately decides not to, begrudgingly accepting him back into the family, sacrificing his own position as the family patriarch. Having done enough damage in the current dimension, Rick seemingly plans to leave it for another and tries to get Morty to come, but he refuses, choosing to stay with his family. Rick grows annoyed with his grandson's choice, as there are countless dimensions he can go to where the same events have already happened. However, Summer's new-found ability to fart on cue like Rick convinces him to stay.\n\nAfterwards, Rick (disguised as another dimension's version of himself called \""Fly Fishing Rick\"") fixes his friendship with the President and returns home for dinner. Beth rejoices in their fresh start, as she is now happily married and finally standing up to Rick, with the whole family (minus Rick) laugh off her clone paranoia.\n\nPost-Credits Scene: Mr. Poopybutthole has started his own family and his own life.

Beth and Jerry, unhappy, tell Rick to respect Morty. After reluctantly apologizing and nicely asking, the two go to Forbodulon Prime to find death crystals, small crystals that allow the holder to see the possible deaths they can encounter. Morty unknowingly steals one from Rick as he uses it to get his best future outcome. In this outcome, he is lying in bed as an old man as Jessica tells him she loves him.\n\nAfter fighting over the wheel, the ship crashes as Rick is flung into a spiked rock, killing him. A hologram of Rick appears as he explains to Morty how to bring Rick back. Morty disobeys, taking the ship.\n\n[[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-12h28m51s785.png|thumb|Fascist Morty shoots Fascist Rick.]]\nMeanwhile, Rick revives in another reality, due to [[Operation Phoenix]], carrying out in a in a loop of realities. Much to his annoyance however, each reality that he reincarnates in is a reality where extreme fascism rules, and is forced to commit a repeat series of mass murder and suicide to reach a reality peaceful and politically stable enough for that reality's Rick and Morty to help him return to his own.\n\n[[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-12h52m16s567.png|thumb|left|Morty's infamous case comes to a close.]]\nBack in the main reality, Morty, being guided by the death crystal he stole, experiences trouble back home and becomes determined to have the reality where he dies next to Jessica to come true. He travels back home and, guided by the crystal, is lead on to do rather bizarre and outlandish things to ensure the outcome. Upon mistakenly riling an extremely violent local school bully, the situation escalates, pushing Morty to access Rick's arsenal, grab several high powered weapons and takes all of Rick's Mr. Meeseeks boxes (except for the \""shitty Kirkland brand Meeseeks boxes\""). He then deals with the bullies, and soon goes on a bloody rampage as the police and even the army become involved, but due to the crystal, he is able to avoid a quite lengthy and certain death sentence, resulting in the presiding judge to declare him innocent and later commit suicide due to Morty's words. Then, on live television, he hesitently let out a cognitohazardous howl, the frequencies of which swayed the undivided focus of anyone listening and convinced them to completely forgive his actions and rendered the entire massacre canonically irrelevant.\n\n[[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-12h58m35s544.png|thumb|Tetsumorty.]]\nMeanwhile, Rick eventually finds a peaceful reality where he is a wasp and [[Wasp Rick]] agrees to help him get back to his original reality.

As Rick and Morty are struck and fall to the ground, Wasp Rick stings the Rick-tree abomination in the eye, causing its head to start swelling up and explodes, releasing numerous mini Wasp Ricks into the air.\n\nAfter things return to normal, Morty apologizes to his grandfather for not listening to him, as Rick takes it in stride. Beth and Jerry appear and attempt to persuade Rick to stop his adventures, because of what happened only for Morty to say he is the one at fault and explain that Rick wasn't even around when the events occurred. Hearing this, Beth states the important thing is that he is okay. Jerry tried to threaten Rick who claims that by touching him, Jerry now has AIDS, causing Jerry to run off in a panic with Beth following behind. While Rick and Morty decide to go on adventures that blend both the familiar with something new, they spot Summer who was eavesdropping and mock or criticize her for 'ruining the season premiere'.\n\n[[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-13h04m04s811.png|thumb|\""''What the fuck?''\""]]\nThe following day, Morty overhears Jessica wishing to become a hospice member who tends to the elderly who will die alone without a family.

On Glootie's forehead is a tattoo that says \""DO NOT DEVELOP MY APP\"". While Glootie persistently asks the family if anyone would like to develop his app, Rick dismisses him and when Jerry asks why the message was tattooed on Glootie's head, Rick specifically says it's so Jerry doesn't do develop Glootie's app. Done with breakfast, Rick alludes to going to the bathroom in a roundabout way. As soon as he steps out of the room, however, Summer explains that Rick is a \""shy pooper\"" and elaborates on how shy he is in detail, even telling the rest of the family he has a special pooping place. Jerry smugly states that he's not a shy pooper like Rick, to sarcastic congratulations.\n\nAfter he finishes with his own toilet business, Jerry loiters by Glootie who is photocopying something. They get into a short conversation about developing Glootie's app without really explaining what it is. Jerry immediately jumps to agree to develop Glootie's app with minimal persuasion.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h11m59s181.png|thumb|left|Rick's secret pooping place.]]\nOn a gorgeous lush planet with beautiful exotic plant life and landscape, Rick lands his ship on a sparkling beach. He wades through tall grass while inhaling the air and goes through a forest with thick tall trees before reaching a toilet seat on a short platform. While enjoying the breathtaking view with its glittering aurora borealis-like light display in the night sky, running glistening stream nearby, gentle breeze, and distant calls of the wild, Rick takes a poop in isolation.\n\nAfter he's done he washes his hands under a small, natural waterfall, he spots a suspiciously broken tree branch a few feet away. Rick pulls out an instrument to analyze which of the inhabitants of the planet could've broken it, but the results are unknown. Furious, Rick lets out a whaling cry. One of the alien animals approaches in response, and Rick turns one of its antlers, revealing it to be a robot of some kind. The creature trots to a tree and connects with it, which opens an elevator in the tree. Deep underground, Rick has a high tech setup. Using a computer, he analyzes the matter that didn't come from him and finds out it's from a specific sandwich an unidentifiable intruder digested earlier.\n\nBack at the Smith Residence, Jerry and Glootie pop champagne celebrating the launch of their app just as Morty walks past the doorway. Morty stops and enters, immediately realizing what Jerry did. Morty incredulously asks why Jerry thinks Rick told them not to develop Glootie's app. When Jerry dismissively says it's because Rick is a \""disrupt-o-phobe\"". Morty grabs him by the collar and tells him it's too keep something horrible from happening that Rick was too lazy to explain. Glootie gladly chimes in to inform them that they've got their first users of the app.\n\nAt the mall, Summer happily opens the new app \""Lovefinderrz\"" on her phone, which just matched her to [[Danny Publits]], a 25-year-old who works at Jersey Mike's and watches 25 Phish shows a year. Beth, who was eating lunch with her, disapproves, not least of which because of Danny's age. When Danny runs over to them in a mess, he blatantly ignores Beth, and he and Summer run off together. Meanwhile, many other people also get notifications on their phones from Lovefinderrz and start running off to their new romantic matches too. Beth, scandalized, calls Jerry to let him know what's going on, disparaging Lovefinderrz's poorly-given name, and informing him she'll be late.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h17m51s828.png|thumb|Morty dismays over Jerry's failure to follow basic commands given by Rick.]]\nEmbarrassed, tells Glootie to shut the app down. But Glootie says he can't; he's just an intern. Dismayed and frustrated, Morty destroys their computer set-up with a tennis racket. Unfortunately, that's not how apps work, as stated by Glootie, and destroying their computer won't immediately affect the app at all. Morty shakes Glootie and tells him to get it off the server then. Glootie tells Morty and Jerry the servers are on his mothership. After a little more shaking and an escape attempt using an \""Ominous Beeping App,\"" he is coerced into taking them aboard.\n\nAt the Best Frog Food Place in Gorgon Quadrant, Rick bursts in on a fly-creature mob boss named [[Vermigurber]] surrounded by his frog lackeys. Rick wants to know about the sandwich, which is first misconstrued to be double-talk for drugs or guns. After Rick threatens the lives of Vermigurber's 470,000 of 800,000 kids and learning that Rick really was there about a literal sandwich, he tells Rick what he wants to know: who ordered the sandwich. Vermigurber doesn't know, but he does tell Rick that the delivery drone who delivered it ran off to fight in the robot wars.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h47m58s507.png|thumb|left|It's worth it to Rick.]]\n{{Quote|'''Vermigurber:''' \""Hey, ape man, I hope this was worth making a whole swarm of enemies.\""<br>'''Rick:''' \""It will be when I find whoever shit in my toilet.\""<br>'''Vermigurber:''' \""Is that... code for something? Someone look that up. If that's drug slang, I need to know it.\""}}\n\nBack with Summer, who just rented motel keys, and Danny, they get interrupted by Beth. When Beth grabs onto Summer's arm to stop her, Summer yells \""assault!,\"" to which Beth retaliates with \""statutory rape!\"" An exhausted-looking motel guest joins the commotion from his window on a higher floor to tell them the people at the motel have their own problems and can't afford to get mixed up in theirs, so they must deal with theirs on their own. Summer tells Beth she can't stop Summer from getting a hotel room, so Beth stubbornly says she'll get the room next to theirs and listen to them with a glass against the wall.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h48m40s570.png|thumb|Summer and Beth cry crimes.]]\n{{Quote|'''Summer:''' \""Fine. Enjoy.\""<br>'''Beth:''' \""I will.\""}}\n\nOn the mothership, Morty and Jerry tell the first person in the teleporter room to take the app down. After Glootie confirms he's their hostage and that none of them have a weapon, the second secretary tells them he's an intern so he can't do anything about the app either. Morty tells him to take them to someone who can do something or he will punch him. He agrees after a beat and they are all escorted to meet the leader of the [[Monogatrons]], Glootie's species.\n\nThe leader tells them that while human race had still been toying with fire, theirs had tamed the power of functioning, committed relationships. Again, Jerry and Morty demand that the app is taken down or else they'll punch him. The leader looks around wondering if there was someone with a gun or other weaon, and Glootie reports it's on its way. Jerry asks what the evil plan is, to which the leader returns with his question of if an evil plan is necessary. The Smiths awkwardly mumble before a gun is finally brought in and it turns out that there really was an evil plan involved. The app was a lure to people with the promise of \""love.\"" As a primitive pre-app species, humans don't realize love is abundant, but not as abundant as water, which is what the leader of the Monogatrons wants from the humans and their planet, and he's using humans' love seeking flaw as a distraction.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h52m32s116.png|thumb|left|Jerry and Morty vs. the interns.]]\nAs the leader is explaining his plan, on Earth, Summer leaves Danny in the middle of the night when the app matches her with someone new and various others around do the same, dumping their previous lovers easily for their new \""soulmate\"" their app matches them with.\n\nAfter explaining the plan, the leader's wife comes in to make date plans. While she and her husband are talking to each other like how to partners in a healthy relationship would, Jerry and Morty fight off the interns and try to escape.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h15m31s235.png|thumb|Rick finds the <strike>delivery</strike> deliverance drone.]]\nIn the middle of the robot wars battlefield at the [[Midland Quasar]], Rick impersonates a Lieutenant Commander by wearing a metal funnel with a QR code on its side as a hat. Just as Rick finds the delivery drone to ask about who he delivered an avian protein club sandwich with no lettuce to, it gets shot in the head. Rick rushes to grab three of the four pieces of the drone's memory archive chip after it is killed in battle, killing a few lizard soldiers standing in his in the process. Upon encountering the fourth quarter, one of the lizard people mockingly swallows the last piece in front of Rick. Out of annoyance, Rick single-handedly upsets the war and the Robolution overturns the lizards.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h18m47s055.png|thumb|left|Conference room three.]]\nWhile the news is being delivered, in a quiet alien office, Rick delivers a sealed contamination box to a solemn, soft-spoken office worker named [[Tony]]. Rick asks where he wants to die, to which Tony calmly asks Susan if conference room three was available. In the office, Tony asks if he could look at a photo of his wife while Rick kills him. Tony soberly and gently explains that his wife is dead, that he's a shy pooper, and that was the reason why he used Rick's nice toilet. Rick gives him a look, before portaling to another dimension where Tony's wife lived, bringing that version of Tony over to explain he used a really awesome toilet that day too. Disgusted, Rick shoves the other Tony back to his dimension and tells Tony not to use his dead wife as an excuse for being a toilet thief. When Rick makes to leave, Tony wonders if Rick's not going to kill him. Petulantly, Rick shouts, \""Don't tell me what to do!\"" before setting a dung bomb on the conference table that poops up a middle finger after stinking the whole room up.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h43m36s952.png|thumb|Robot Rick about to sit on Tony.]]\nBack in his high tech bunker, Rick is vibing when he gets an alert that Tony has returned to poop on the toiler. Rick disbelievingly gets into a giant robot version of himself to confront Tony. The two get into an argument, with Tony fearlessly telling the giant Rick that pooping is a bid for control; a way to protect that one thing from a universe that takes whatever it wants. Rick stubbornly turns around, pulls his pants down, and sits on Tony in response.\n\nTony opens his eyes to cloudy toilet heaven and is greeted by his wife. Both God and his wife encourage him to poop with them, but Tony grows more dissatisfied and sad the more they insist. It turns out Tony is actually hooked up to a giant artificial sac filled with a red liquid. Perhaps subconsciously Tony is aware it's not actually heaven, so his body twists itself around to choke himself with the breathing tubes. Before he can die, Rick comes to cut him out. \n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h46m24s063.png|left|thumb|Tony bewildered.]]\n{{Quote|'''Tony:''' \""Where are we?

Get out.\""<br>'''Tony:''' \""You can make a perfectly-realized, toilet-filled simulation of heaven, but you can't share a toilet?\""}}\n\nIndignant, Rick explains the chemical is called [[Globaflyn]], which connects the whatever-you-want section of the brain to the whatever-you-have section. Tony looks around at all the various people trapped in sacs which is kind of prison Rick built where they could live their wildest dreams while leaving Rick out of them. Tony hits the nail on the head with the realization that they're people Rick refuses to kill and refuses to let into his life. Pettily, Rick opens a portal and tells him it's Tony's last chance since he rejected the heaven Rick had offered. Amused, Tony tells Rick he'll be seeing him, offering friendship even as Rick, ill-tempered, pretends otherwise.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h57m33s247.png|thumb|Morty and Jerry discovered.]]\nIn a ventilation shaft, Morty and Jerry come up with a plan to destroy the mothership and escape. Exasperated and fed-up, Morty wearily agrees. Jerry insists on a high-five despite Morty's ill humor and pointed comments about how they were in that mess because of Jerry but finally gives in. Unfortunately, the grate under them collapses and the two land in the middle of an army of soldiers.\n\nBack with the toilet, Rick rigs and connects it to a complicated-looking and foreboding looking system.\n\n[[File:S4e2 soulmate 3.png|thumb|left|Summer's 4th \""soulmate.\""]]\nOn Earth, havoc continues to reign with the constantly hooking-up and un-hooking-up couples. Summer paraglides into a church to interrupt the wedding between her latest beau, Jeff. Just as Jeff asks the priest to marry them instead of with the bride, a man on a motorcycle bursts in to take Jeff away. The two ride away just as another man riding a horse burst through a window for the bride. Another wall collapse as a construction worker rides a crane to pick up the priest. Then a woman in a hot air balloon crashed through the ceiling for Summer. Beth, determinedly following Summer, crashes her paraglider into a barnyard. The farmer inside shouts at her in shock asking what she's doing. Beth shortly replies she's parenting.\n{{Quote|'''Farmer:''' \""That's not how I did it.\""<br>'''Beth:''' \""Yeah, where's ''your'' daughter?\""<br>'''Farmer:''' \""Ah, you're right...

She sadly informs Rick that Tony died after quitting his job, living life to the fullest before crashing into a tree space-skiing down Mount Space Everest. \n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-23h10m05s567.png|thumb|Everyone starts deleting Lovefinderrz.]]\nSummer, who was on a plane with the last woman gets another ping on her phone to let her know she has a new soulmate and leaves to meet him. After greeting him, she gets into another fight with Beth who is determined to mother her. The two get into a dramatic physical fight on the airport apron. When Summer's phone pings yet again, she desperately picks it up after Beth had knocked it away momentarily. This time however the app is covered with Ad wall. Already tired of it, Summer deletes the app and numerous others with the app do the same. Listlessly, Summer and Beth head home.\n\nThe Monogatron leader gets huffy about losing Earth and when his wife tries to console him they end up bickering about the importance of water over their relationship.\n\n[[File:S4e2 Beth matched with ted danson.png|thumb|left|Beth matched with Ted Danson.]]\nBack home, Jerry and Beth talk about Beth using the app, but Beth reassures him she didn't. The two hug and Beth hides the fact that she was matched up with [[wikipedia:Ted Danson|Ted Danson]] before deleting the app.\n\nAt Tony's funeral, Rick gives Tony's dad $8 billion in his local currency, a kit to clone a new son even though it wouldn't have the same brain as Tony, and tries to comfort the dad by explaining in that one of the infinite universes Rick explored there's a version of Tony that was completely evil because of how fulfilled he was. Sympathetically, the dad puts a hand on Rick's chest, intuitively saying it was hard losing a friend. Rick abruptly curses him and denies he was Rick's friend.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-23h15m23s980.png|thumb|Rick crowned the King of Shit.]]\nBack at the toilet, Rick pees over the side of the cliff instead of using the toilet. He drunkenly stumbles over to it before sitting down. When the two intimidating giant-gun like mechanisms rise out of the ground point at him, they turn out to be speakers, repeatedly mocking in Rick's voice as numerous holograms of him appear cheering and applauding. As Rick sits on the toilet and the main hologram continues to mock him, a crown that was in the toilet tank is placed on Rick's head and it starts to rain. Rick's situation has a similar feeling that of what happens at the end of \""Auto Erotic Assimilation\"" in season 2 episode 3.\n\n[[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-23h16m01s348.png|left|thumb|\""...The saddest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos\"".]]\n{{Quote|There he is.

But before the two are permitted to enter as professionals (as Rick refuses them to attend as fans), they were told to assemble a crew together to attain credentials. After an unsuccessful attempt to sneak Morty in alone, the two travel back to Rick's garage where he decides to set foot on the convention with the help of his \""crew\""\u2014 consisting of alien pianist [[Glar]], literally multi-handed [[Angie Flint]], and vampire monster truck diver [[Truckula]].\n\nAfter entering successfully, Rick and Morty immediately ditch the three and proceed to the convention hall where Miles is presenting a conference. Rick heckles and confronts Miles, to which the latter challenges him to a \""heist-off\""\u2014with the first crew to heist the Crystal Skull of Horwitz wins and consolidates the losing team. After Rick agrees to the terms, Miles declares that he had already won by presenting his crew\u2014which now includes Glar, Angie, and Truckula, revealing that he had double-crossed Rick by snipping the three instantly after Rick leaves left behind.\n\n[[file:S4e3 2019-11-28-12h58m03s673.png|thumb|Hiestotron puts Knightly's 8 under mind control.]]\n\nBut when Miles opens the loot bag, he is surprised to find out that the skull is missing and was replaced with Rick's feces. Rick reveals that the skull was already in Morty's bag, and divulges that he had built a robot in his garage. The robot, named Heistotron, is tasked by Rick to calculate Miles's heist plan and add a double cross with a switcheroo. The bot gives him the three members as most likely to double-cross him, and upon being snipped by Miles to his team, hypnotizes all of them to give Rick and Morty the crystal. In addition, while the bot also puts all the attendees in a state of hypnosis, Rick and Morty wait at the bar where the latter is writing a heist script. Upon winning the heist-off, Rick orders everyone to steal everything in the convention, which leads to Miles's death.\n\nAs the two are about to leave, Heistotron refuses to comply with Rick's orders to shut down and goes rogue. Rick barely escapes with Morty and recruits [[Mr. Poopybutthole]]  (now a professor), the god [[Hephaestus]], [[Ventriloquiver]] (an archer ventriloquist dummy), and [[Elon Tusk]] (an alternate version of Elon Musk with tusks for teeth) as his second random set of crew to fight Heistotron.\n\nDuring their assembly, Rick explains to the crew of his plan of randomly taking orders from his robot Randotron, Heistotron's antithesis. Due to waiting from Randotron's random instructions when they're \""not ready\"", the crew were left to do nothing.

When Rick tries to brush it off, Morty brings up how he agreed to help with the adventure in exchange for one. Irritated by his constant demands, Rick sprays Morty with a gas which inadvertently knocks them both out and causes the [[Space Cruiser]] to start veering out of control as they head back towards Earth. After crashing, Rick wakes up in the hospital to Beth reiterating Rick's promise to Morty.\n\nAt home, a [[The Wizard|Wizard]] summons a dragon called [[Balthromaw]] and produces a blood oath contract that Morty signs, bonding him to the dragon forever.\n\n[[file:S4e4 jerry and cat.png|thumb|Jerry and the talking cat.]]\nAfter Morty receives his dragon, [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] pulls Rick aside and inquires about a [[Talking Cat|talking cat]] he found in the house; Rick mentions that he has no idea about it before leaving. Accepting it, Jerry asks the cat several times why it can talk but the cat tells Jerry not to worry about it; to go with the flow and not ask too many questions. And that they go to Florida.\n\nAfter Morty flies around with Balthromaw for a while, they land for a break. While Morty puts on the pretense that what they have is a partnership of equality, Balthromaw only wants to laze around, which Morty roundaboutly shuts down. \n\n[[file:S4e4 get high.png|thumb|left|Rick and Balthromaw get high.]]\nThe dragon retreats to a newly dug cavern underneath the Smith family yard; while Rick is watching TV with [[Summer Smith|Summer]], they both notice and poke fun at how dejected Morty is with a dragon. After Rick is nearly killed by the dozing dragon's flame breath, he goes to kill it; after he ambushes Balthromaw, Rick takes a close look at the treasure that he is guarding and is amazed by some of the contents. He decides to not kill Balthromaw and they go off and cause havoc at a nearby zoo. Enjoying the other's company, Rick and Balthromaw perform a \""Soul Bond\"" ritual, connecting their souls together. \n\n[[file:S4e4 2019-12-10-15h02m03s959.png|thumb|Summer and Morty witness Rick and Balthromaw's soul bonding.]]\nWhile this happens, both Morty and Summer witness this, causing Morty to lash out in anger. This breach of the contract summons the Wizard and, pronouncing Balthromaw a slut dragon for having bonded to multiple riders, whips the dragon (which Rick can feel due to their bond) and takes the dragon away to sentence it. Rick, Morty, and Summer than travel to the dragon world to save Balthromaw and undo their soul bonding.\n\nMeanwhile, with Jerry and the cat, they had a nice time with a bunch of party-goers playing volleyball on the beach until one discovers some cat poop barely covered in sand. The cat quickly blames it on Jerry, causing the party-goers to chase Jerry away and the cat goes with the party-goers onto a nearby party yacht. After the cat is later thrown off the boat, it swims back to Jerry.\n\n[[file:S4e4 2019-12-10-16h04m51s028.png|thumb|left|The all-slut slut phoenix dragon, Slut vs. three dragons.]]\nWhile they attempt to free the dragon, Rick, Morty, and Summer learn that the bonding is permanent and nothing can be done; the four are then forced to flee into hiding. While laying low, they and Balthromaw encounter several other outcast/slut dragons including [[Debranavox|Debrah]], [[Michael (Dragon)|Michael]] and the Shadow Jacker. They eventually join forces via a massive soul-bond ritual and are able to fly back to the lair of the Wizard; the combined energy of the Smiths and the slut dragons kill the Wizard and frees Balthromaw, Rick, Morty and the other dragons. Since the Wizard is dead, the bond between Balthromaw and Rick is broken.\n\nAfter returning home, Rick immediately leaves with the excuse that Jerry needs to be picked up from the airport with the talking cat and severs ties with the dragon. And Morty eventually dismisses Balthromaw as well, sending him away with disgust.\n\nAfter traveling for a while, Rick makes a stop in the desert so they can supposedly stretch their legs and is able to trap the cat inside an energy box. Rick tells the confused cat that he will do a mind scan on it to discover why he can talk, despite the latter\u2019s repeated claims of being from space. Rick calls the cat out on the lie and looks through his vision goggles to discover the history. Subsequently, Rick is aghast by what he sees, looks away horrified. Seeing Rick act this way, Jerry wishes to see for himself but Rick tries in vain to stop him. Jerry ends up repeatedly vomiting in the sand before crawling backward away from the cat. The cat wants to amend things, but Rick banishes it in the desert; as the latter tries to plea with them; Rick and Jerry mutually scream at the cat to go away. \n\n{{quote|He was in my home... where I keep photos of my parents!|Jerry}}\n[[file:S4e4 jerry's mind blowers.png|thumb|Rick mind blows Jerry, because someone will remember.]]\nRick offers to erase Jerry's memories, the latter refuses, believing someone needed to remember. Despite this, Rick erases Jerry's memory anyway to spare him the mental anguish and torture.\n\nThe post-credits scene shows Balthromaw carrying his plunder through the street and scaring off a motorist who tried to proposition him. The cat soon arrives and the two decide to stick together, becoming friends who have been rejected by humans."

Morty passes on Beth\u2019s concerns that Jerry will kill himself in the light-hanging process. Jerry says he can hang lights safely; Rick responds by accusing Jerry of lying. Jerry promptly falls off the roof, but before he hits the ground, Rick zaps him with a ray that makes Jerry\u2019s body lighter than air. He then zaps Jerry\u2019s shoes with a ray that makes them heavier than air, rendering Jerry \u201cneutrally buoyant\u201d. As Rick and Morty climb into the spaceship, Jerry celebrates his buoyancy, which allows him to jump high up in the air and then slowly sink back down. Remembering a warning that the ray will eventually wear off, Jerry sets a timer to keep track of how long he will be neutrally buoyant.\n\nIn space, Rick and Morty are arguing about piss and centipedes when (somehow) the spaceship hits \u201ca sharp thing in space\u201d and gets a flat tire. Rick puts on a spacesuit and goes out to fix the flat, giving Morty strict instructions not to follow. Morty promptly ignores these instructions, dons a spacesuit, and goes outside. Rick, who is fixing the flat, starts yelling at Morty to go back in the ship. While the two are arguing, a snake astronaut slithers up and bites Morty in the ankle. Morty kills the snake by breaking its astronaut suit with a hubcap, but it is clear he has been seriously injured.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h05m23s343.png|thumb|Snake racism. As hilarious and stupid as human racism.]]\n\nSoon afterward, Morty begins to turn purple, a symptom of the poison that the snake injected into him when it bit him. Rick flies to the snake\u2019s home planet, scans it, and synthesizes an anti-venom serum, which promptly cures Morty. The scan also reveals that the snakes on the planet have formed an advanced patchwork of industrial societies\u2014 there are 19 billion snakes divided into 10,000 nations, all on the brink of global war because of race. Rick remarks that the concept of racist snakes is hilarious, and begins to fly away. Morty, horrified that he killed an astronaut who might have been the snakes\u2019 last hope for survival, and despairs that he is the reason \u201c19 billion snakes lost all hope!\u201d Rick responds that the snakes\u2019 loss of hope is their own fault, reminding Morty that the snake astronaut bit its first alien contact.\n\nOn earth, we see Jerry bouncing into the city, where he sees a group of friends of many different races playing basketball together. Jerry asks to join the game, offering a bet that \u201cthis white boy can jump\u201d. The players take exception to Jerry\u2019s use of racial epithets, pointing out that the basketball court is the one place left in society that racism has not touched. Jerry tries to make amends, but ends up inadvertently implying that he is a Nazi. He decides to just try taking a jump shot, but as he jumps up, one of his shoes falls off, causing Jerry to go flying up into the sky as the basketball players look on, taking pride in the fact that their neighborhood has integrity.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h09m17s507.png|left|thumb|Morty stuffing Slippy into the snake spacesuit.]]\n\nAfter returning from the space adventure, Morty continues to blame himself for the snake planet\u2019s impending doom. Having held onto the space snake\u2019s body, he holds a vigil, where he hatches an idea on how to restore hope to the snakes. He goes to a pet store & buys a snake roughly the size of the space snake to take her place, whom he names Slippy. Morty proceeds to draw markings on Slippy similar to the ones the space snake had and then force Slippy into the space snake\u2019s astronaut suit, being bitten multiple times in the process.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h10m21s798.png|thumb|Slippy picked up and on the snake news.]]\n\nMorty then flies Slippy to the snake planet and throws her out the window. A parachute opens on the spacesuit, gently carrying Slippy down to the surface. Military officials from one of the nations on the snake planet detect Slippy and intercept her.\n\n\n\n\nWe then see a montage of Snake scientists, academics, politicians, and military officials attempting to interact with Slippy. The nation\u2019s president appears at a press conference with Slippy, who hisses at reporters in a language they don\u2019t understand. Snake academics record these hisses and attempt to decipher them. One snake professor finally manages to translate them. The military then recruits the professor to talk with Slippy, who is being held in a room at the Snake Pentagon.\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h13m31s663.png|left|thumb|The two snakes fuck.]]\nThe professor talks with Slippy, first through an intercom and later by entering the room and speaking with her directly. Though Slippy seems suspicious at first, she eventually grows to trust the professor. She wraps herself around the professor in an aggressive display of affection. Though surprised, the professor quickly reciprocates, and the two make love while being monitored by other snake military officials.\n\nBack on earth, Rick, Morty and Summer are playing Downbeat when Beth enters the room and asks about Jerry. Morty, much to Rick\u2019s chagrin, reveals that Rick made Jerry lighter than air. Beth expresses concern that Jerry will fall out of the sky to his death; Rick responds that that could only happen if Jerry messes up wearing shoes. Quickly realizing that that is in fact quite possible, Rick and Beth rush to find & save Jerry.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h16m58s956.png|thumb|Horrific Jerry clone head]]\n\nJerry is revealed to be flying through the sky while attempting to return to the ground. He has tied the legs of his pants together and is holding the torso area open so the pants will fill with rainwater. Beth calls Jerry on his cellphone and tries to convince him to tell her where he is so Rick can pick him up. Jerry tells Beth nothing is wrong and that he is just buying lights at the store. However, Rick notices that he is lying and freezes Beth using a special remote, and then tries to level with Jerry, but Jerry rebuffs Rick. As far as Jerry is concerned, his predicament is a \""win-win\"": if he survives and returns home, it will be without Ricks help, but if he dies, it will be entirely Rick's fault. Rick decides to let Jerry try to get out on his own as he manages to lower himself enough to grab onto a tree. Before unfreezing Beth, Rick activates a special gadget in his lair, which created a disfigured, fungus-grown Jerry head, whom he uses to trick Beth into thinking that her husband was okay.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h18m25s186.png|thumb|left|This bar has a lot of ceiling fans.]]\n\nMeanwhile, in a bar, Jerry walks in, carrying a boulder into a bar and looks for a driver. The bartender and patrons tell Jerry he can\u2019t bring the boulder in with him. When Jerry drops the boulder, he floats up to the ceiling; the bartender and patrons tell him this isn\u2019t allowed, either. The patrons end up throwing Jerry out of the bar, causing him to immediately fly up into the sky again.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h20m31s672.png|thumb|A grotesque Terminator-esque robot comes to save the Smiths.]]\n\nBack at the house, Morty is in his room when a snake-shaped robot [[Portal Technology|teleports]] to his position. The robot attempts to kill Morty, but a snake enters the room wielding a shotgun. The snake and robot fight with each other, and Morty runs to the garage, where he warns Beth and Rick about the snakes. Beth and Rick are initially skeptical at first, but when snakes and snake robots start appearing in the room and trying to kill Morty, they quickly get the message. Beth, Rick, and Morty grab weapons and try to kill the snakes, which keep attacking in growing numbers. A humanoid snake robot arrives to tell the family, but Beth crushes him to death in a panic. Morty asks Rick why the snakes would attack him when he was just trying to help them. Rick angrily responds that by sending Slippy to masquerade as the original astronaut, instead of leaving well enough alone, Morty unwittingly informed the snakes that there was something bigger and scarier to unite against. Now, instead of falling into the Dark Ages for a couple of generations, select snakes create new technology such as time travel in an attempt to kill him.  \n\nIn other words, none of this chaos would be possible if Morty simply did what Rick said in space and stayed in the car. \n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h22m49s372.png|thumb|left|All hail Morty.]]\n\nTrue to Rick's words, some time in the Snake Planet's future, the war costs the lives of 17 billion snakes by the end. Soon after, a new ''Terminator''-esque war rages between snakes and machines. The surviving snakes from the previous war managed to defeat the machines in part because Morty somehow helped unite them.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h22m59s512.png|thumb|Chaos in the Snake Pentagon]]\n\nBack at the Snake Planet, Rick and Morty land on the planet where the war between snakes and machines is in its earliest stage. Rick and Morty fight their way into the Snake Pentagon, where they defeat robots and snake soldiers alike. They briefly see Slippy, who is being threatened by several time-traveling robot snakes and protected by time-traveling snakes, making her a central source of the conflict that can determine the planet's fate. \n\n[[File:S4e5_2019-12-29-14h27m31s472.png|thumb|left|Snake M.I.T. in 1985]]\n\nThey then reach the center of \u201cSnakenet\u201d, where a time machine is under construction. They kill the scientists making the time machine, but they realize that it is not even a quarter finished, Rick makes a mental note to blueprint time travel in a format snakes can understand or, in his case, \""committing more to Morty's current 'fuck-ups' \"". As he said that, future versions of Rick and Morty show up with a book full of instructions on time travel written in the snakes\u2019 language, portable time machines, and snake costumes. Future Morty, who is sporting a black eye, rudely insults current Morty, and future Rick insults current Rick. Future Rick and Future Morty then leave. Rick and Morty put on the snake costumes, travel back to 1985, and leave the time travel instructions at Snake MIT before returning to the present, hoping the snakes' own self discovery will be their undoing. \n\nAfter they leave, a snake student and his peers read the time travel instructions and use them to build a time machine. They send a student back to the 19th century to prevent Snake Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, sending him a letter which told him to duck, preventing his assassination. The student returns victorious, only to find that the ripple-effect of protecting Lincoln has altered the timeline and caused his present to be ruled by Snake Nazis.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h31m11s914.png|thumb|Snake time travel chaos]]\n\nNot taking any chances, the student grabs a chainsaw and steps back into the time machine. In 1938, Snake Adolf Hitler is giving a speech in Snake Berlin. He then goes inside to take a shower. A series of snake time travelers show up\u2014 some seeking to kill Snake Hitler, others seeking to protect him, or just fight one another as Snake Hitler stares at them in confusion. The time travelers start killing each other, leading to pandemonium.\n\nOn earth in the present, Jerry briefly calls Beth to ask for help. When she doesn\u2019t answer, he leaves a voicemail promising to come home with \u201cthe best Christmas lights ever!\u201d He grabs ahold of a jet, which he holds onto when the neutral buoyancy wears off. A snake-human hybrid robot approaches Jerry and offers to save his life; Jerry, thinking the robot is from Rick, kicks it away, causing it to fly into the plane\u2019s engine. The plane careens toward the ground\u2014 Jerry jumps away at the last minute, grabs a tree, and climbs to safety.\n\nBack on earth in the present, time-traveling snakes and snake robots are raining down on the suburbs, still fighting to the death. Summer & Beth are hard at work killing them, but to no avail. Morty worries that giving snakes time travel just made it worse, but Rick reassures him that things will work out in their favor, knowing what would happen next.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h33m35s614.png|thumb|left|4th Dimensional Time Cop Headquarters]]\n\nIn the fourth dimension, [[Shleemypants]] receives a phone call, informing him of the incident. He and another time cop travel to the snake planet and go back in time until they find the first snake to use tools. They proceed to beat that snake to death, thereby preventing the snake civilization (as we know it) from ever developing. In the present on earth, all the attacking snakes and snake robots suddenly disappear, the ones that haven't fallen writhing in pain before involuntarily eating their own tails. As this counted as one of Morty's adventures, Rick pulls out the card, but this time, he tears it apart, declaring that there are no freebies because of what happened.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h34m39s598.png|thumb|The only way to tie up a time travel story is ouroboros, or basically dealing with the source of the problem]]\n\nJerry reveals himself to be on the roof, and claims he was there the entire time. He then promptly falls off and breaks his leg. Rick heals the leg halfway, claiming that the other fifty percent is on him. He then remarks to Morty that Jerry sucks, yet Morty does not challenge this assertion Rick, Morty, and the family go inside to have some eggnog, only for the former two to once again encounter their future selves, who rudely remind them that they need to make snake costumes and translate time travel instructions into the snakes\u2019 language. Both Rick and Morty resign themselves to doing this.\n\n[[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h38m02s569.png|thumb|left|Merry Christmasssss.]]\n\nIn the post-credits scene, they finish the instructions and time machines and travel to the snake planet to hand off the instructions, but before doing so, Rick punches Morty in the eye while reminding him to stay in the car next time. This resolves the causality loop and explains Morty\u2019s black eye.\n\n{{-}}"

A conductor with a red misshapen nose says \""Tickets, please\"" and takes his ticket. The man sits down at the bar. A second man sits next to him and asks the bartender for a drink for his \""colleague\"", presuming they are both on the train to kill Rick Sanchez. He suggests to the first man that they swap stories and begins his own.\n\nIn the story, the second man is seated on a throne of skulls and orders his minions to lower a prisoner into a vat of acid. Rick enters. The man asks Rick how Rick found him; Rick responds to his questions with farts. The man orders his minions to attack Rick, who quickly defeats his attackers. The man from the bar says, \""Now *I'll* fight you!\"" Uncharacteristically, Rick looks scared and flees.\n\nBack on the train, the second man now asks the first man why he's going to kill Rick; the first man replies annoyed that he doesn't know any Rick Sanchez. As others begin telling their own stories of Rick, the first man leaves the dining car. In the next car, the man encounters a circle of storytellers regaling one another with heartwarming tales of Rick's good deeds. Goomby, one of the storytellers, relates the story of how Rick saved \""Space Christmas\"". The group laughs appreciatively, then aggressively demands the man should tell his own \""Christmas Rick\"" story. The first man angrily declines and threatens them with his gun so that he can leave the car.\n\nEntering the next car, he encounters a blonde woman wearing a low-cut top, whom he threatens to shoot if she cues up a Rick vignette. In explaining she doesn't know how she got there, she begins a cutaway story in which she enters a train car (the conductor appears from behind a plant and takes her ticket) and meets an older woman who asks her why she dated Rick Sanchez. The older woman embarks on her own cutaway story about when Rick met her family, which is interrupted by a warning shot from the man's gun. He admonishes the blonde woman for beginning a vignette; she protests that she wasn't trying to. The man begins to monologue about the train amplifying and linking narratives. When the woman becomes distracted by her own cleavage, the man realizes what's happening, and the two reveal themselves to be Rick and Morty in disguise.\n\nRick explains they are stuck in a literal story device, an anthology. The conductor enters. Pointing his gun, Rick tells him to stop the train, but the conductor turns out to be a powerful fighter. After he skillfully uses Morty as a human shield, Rick instead shoots the train window, sucking the conductor half out the window.\n\nThe conductor is suddenly in an arcade. He pulls off a helmet attached to a game (which he's just lost) called \""Tickets Please\"". He returns to his family but doesn't believe anything is real. Moments later the top half of his body tears away bloodily and begins to pirouette toward the arcade ceiling, spraying blood everywhere. The scene cuts back to outside the train, where the window Rick shot has cut the pirouetting conductor in half.\n\nRick plugs the hole in the window, but so much air has gone that the train deploys \""emergency continuity\"" as oxygen masks that drop down. Rick breathes in, then takes the large tank connected to the masks labeled \""Continuity\"". Train police break in, threaten Rick and Morty to tee up a story about Rick and end up shooting the tank, which explodes.\n\nCut to a police training class, which is using the last scene as an educational tool. But Rick and Morty are suddenly among the students. They subdue the students and the teacher, and Rick finds a diagram labeled \""Anthology\"" in the teacher's desk that shows a circle with eight segments (Dan Harmon's \""story circle\"").\n\nThe train rumbles, signaling an act break and a musical number with Rick and Birdperson. Via the continuing narrative of the pirouetting conductor at the arcade, the story winds its way back to Rick and Morty, wearing space suits and walking on the hull of the train. After putting the conductor out of his misery, Rick and Morty must disrupt the \""thematic seal\"" by Morty telling an unrelated story. Morty eventually succeeds by telling a story of Summer and Beth fighting off scorpions with their period rays. The two of them make it into the train's engine compartment before Rick runs out of air, only to confront Story Lord (\""like a Matrix space Frasier\""). \n\nStory Lord captures and binds them and reveals his plan: drain Rick and Morty of story potential to fuel the anthology train. After a series of cutaway narratives, modulated by Story Lord's control panel (which influences things like \""narrative energy\"" and \""broad appeal\"") , Rick and Morty find themselves in a final narrative that Story Lord views through a runed portal: the pair must face armies of Meeseeks, Citadel Guards, male Gazorpians and Evil Morty. Rick defeats Story Lord's plans by telling Morty about Jesus Christ, his personal savior. The control panel drains of power, and the train grinds to a halt.\n\nAs Veggie-Tales-like cartoon characters surround Rick and Morty, Story Lord jumps into the narrative through the portal to yell at them. Jesus Christ descends from the heavens and drives everyone to their knees, and Rick and Morty use the distraction to leap back through the portal, trapping Story Lord in the narrative. But when they try to restart the train, the controls crumble away, fake.\n\nCut to Rick and Morty in the Smith living room looking at a glowing model train traveling in a circle. Morty has bought it for Rick at the Citadel. Rick expresses great happiness that Morty spent money and engaged in capitalism. In the train narrative, Story Lord is talking to Jesus Christ, who decides to escape by summoning magic blood. In the living room, the train short-circuits and derails. \n\nRick grows angry that the train is broken. When Morty suggests that he could return the broken train, Rick gets angrier and tells Morty to buy another one instead, reminding him that \""''nobody's out there shopping with this [[Wikipedia:COVID-19 pandemic|fucking virus]]!''\""\n\nThe post-credits scene is an ad for Story Train."

Rick immediately understands the situation and kills their respective facehuggers. Neither know how they got to that point and Rick is dismissive of the parasitic alien species. That is, until they spot a shockingly developed city.\n\nWhile trying to find Rick's car ship, they find out that Morty's facehugger was a celebrated leader, while Rick's was a political-soapbox-YouTuber that was largely looked down on contemptuously by the alien society. \n\nThe two find the car tied to a freight ship that would drop loads of the alien eggs on Earth. While they had originally tried to make a clean escape using the corpses of their facehuggers as disguises, they are quickly seen through. Rick and Morty manage to leave the planet after causing devestating destruction to the city and its people. \n\nThe two are in a good mood, high off of guilt-free murder. As they enjoy breakfast, Beth asks about Summer. The two stutteringly make excuses and head back to the planet to look for Summer who they'd completely forgotten about. \n\nAfter causing more mayhem, the two find her being waited on and worshipped by the aliens. After having them arrested Summer goes to their prison cell and explains what happened after Rick and Morty stupidly got close to the facehugger eggs and got possessed.\nSummer, who's new \""thing\"" was chewing on a toothpick, killed whatever facehugger tried to jump on her. She finds out that the facehuggers generally only lived about half an hour before laying eggs in their hosts and died an explosive death. Using that to her advantage, she reasonably coaxes a new way of life, where they didn't all have to die just for the sake of laying eggs. \n\nSummer quickly becomes their ruler and appoints Morty's facehugger, Steve, as their inspired leader. Rick's facehugger, Bruce, grows jealous and leaves their growing government to make those anti-politic online videos. As things are going well, Steve and Summer chat in a friendly manner before she brings up freeing her brother. Steve realizes that all Summer wants is her family back and goes to Bruce to rant and complain. \n\nBruce resentfully gives Steve an I-told-you-so, but Steve is exasperated with his social stance against their species' progressive life. Bruce angrily explodes that he was angry that Summer had taken away Bruce; revealing his jealousy. \n{{Quote|'''Steve:''' Why do you hate her so much?!<br>'''Bruce:''' Because she took you away from me!}}\n\nAlthough awkward at first, the two makeup with a sizzling kiss and plan to runaway together. That's when Rick and Morty were freed. \n\nHer story done, Rick and Morty are a little bewildered that Summer would know how that second half of the story went, but she dismissively waves it off. Everyone around the office knew about Steve and Bruce. \n\nSummer's plan for escape is sentencing the two to death... by way of leaving in Rick's car. And of course, Summer had to go with them to make sure they died. The facehugger society is not stupid however and catches on that they're all just trying to escape. When they were jailed, Rick and Morty discover that Morty's terrible harmonica playing causes the aliens to combust. So, using the car's speakers they massacre even more of the aliens before finally leaving the planet. \n\nWhen they reach home, Summer goes back to her room and Rick and Morty retire to the living room. For a moment they believe the aliens really had laid eggs in them and they were going to explode. But it just turned out that they both just actually shitted theirselves\n\nAfter the end credits, [[Tricia Lange|Tricia]] watches Jerry keeping bees in the garden from Summers bedroom window, after she increasingly implies she\u2019s sexually attracted to him to Summer, she finally says she wants to have sex with him to a bored and annoyed Summer; who sarcastically responds \""Oh, ''really?''\"".

During the flight, Morty mentions that Rick might be setting him up for a double-cross. Morty seems done with Rick's shenanigans. Rick tells Morty that they don't have to worry - and as a last ditch effort, if things \""go wrong\"", that he's got a plan, and tells Morty to leap into the same vat of acid he does. Morty still complains, and says he should be doing English homework. However, Rick doesn't budge and resumes the ride.\n\nRick meets up with some intergalactic barters who he trades with. All seems well until the dealer tells Rick he's been duped, and that they successfully scammed Rick. Angered by this, Rick forms a third arm and shoots a dealer in the head. However, still held at gunpoint, Rick and Morty are forced to jump in the vat of fake acid that he prepared in advance. Rick and Morty sink to the bottom of the vat of acid, and open up predetermined hatches in order to trick the dealers into thinking that they died. The dealer and his cronies take time to watch the bones settle. They are in shock that a grandfather would commit suicide with his grandson, and mourn over Morty's death. Rick and Morty lie in wait at the bottom of the vat, until the dealer and his cronies vanish. Morty begins to get impatient after an extended period of time, as the dealers take the time for self-reflection and then decide of the bones, and takes it upon himself to rise out of the acid and kill the dealers. He misfires, and Rick takes the gun from him and kills all of the cronies. They then make a getaway.\n\nMorty begins to get mad at Rick's faulty plan, and that Rick should be more open-minded instead of falling back on himself all of the time. Rick argues that he was able to handle things all by himself when he was turned into a pickle, and that Morty's adventure with the dragon was a total disaster. Morty then waves the fact that Rick likes to ignore most ideas Morty pitches over his head. As the argument escalates, it turns out that Rick has already refused Morty's request for a device that would allow him to save a point in time (like that of a video game), so that Morty can visit said time restarts. Rick, in a fit of rage, reluctantly agrees. Shortly after, Rick admits that he actually is unable to make said device, and proceeds to shoot Morty. After being shot Morty is still breathing - suggesting he was stunned - however, Rick triggers the device creating the first time stamp and encourages an oblivious Morty to have fun with the device.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Morty has a lot of fun with his time-saving device - including pulling his teacher's pants down, talking to his love interest Jessica, avoiding embarrassing moments, rectifying bad decisions and saving himself from death. One day, he activates the time save before approaching a girl outside of a coffee shop to talk to her. They get along well and go on a date, which leads to a long-term relationship. Morty and his (unnamed) girlfriend go through many ups and down over the following months, and even break-up at one point, but emerge stronger than ever. The two go on vacation together, but the plane they boarded on crashes and they get stranded on a mountain range. They are forced to resort to cannibalism to stay alive, and Morty starts trekking across the mountains to retrieve his backpack. Although he finds the time-save device, Morty decides not activate it, and uses his frost-bitten hands to call for a rescue. He is saved just in time, and after an extended stay in hospital Morty and his girlfriend fully recover from their ordeal. At their welcome home party, Morty and his girlfriend are happier and stronger than ever... until Jerry mistakes the time-save device for the TV remote and hits the buttons, 'restoring' Morty's save point back to before he approached his girlfriend. He tries to approach her again, but gets pepper-sprayed in the face for his troubles. In his pain, he falls on the time-save device and saves that point, leaving him unable to go back and try again.\n\nDepressed that the time-save has only made him more miserable, Morty throws himself to a bunch of gorillas at the local zoo a few times. Finally he goes to see Rick, sick and tired of restarting time, and decides to take these experiences as an opportunity to face the consequences of his actions. \n\nRick however lets Morty know that his previous actions did, in fact, have consequences. Stating that he has never believed in time travel, reveals to Morty that the boy didn't perform any \""do-overs\"", but rather \""did it, over and over\"". Showing a recording of one of these \""do-overs\"", Rick shows that all the \""time resets\"" were actually different probabilities of him all along. This caused the death of numerous Morty's, moving the present Morty in their place, not unlike the movie ''Prestige''. Disgusted with his actions, Morty is in a state of despair, as he doesn't know what to do or how to fix the mess he caused. Rick suggests that he can fuse all of his alternate selves and their respective universes. Fed up, Morty complies and Rick reveals that he is not Morty's original Rick but another Rick who says all Ricks have a vat of acid. He then merges the universes together and returns Morty to the first save point with his Rick. All of a sudden, a bunch of law enforcement members and protesters appear outside of Rick's garage, with anti-Morty posters (consequences of his actions in the other universes). Morty is terrified and confused, however Rick is determined to make Morty learn his lesson and tells him to jump into the fake vat of acid he's set up. Grumbling, Morty does so (just as his previous girlfriend arrives, only to leave in tears upon seeing Morty go into the acid) and hides at the bottom releasing fake bones just like he did before. Satisfied, and feeling a bit guilty, everybody vacates the premises except for the two cops. The cops seem to doubt Morty's death and drop a ladle in, and Morty's attempt to blow it up results in him accidentally shooting the cop in two and splashing his partner with the fake acid. The remaining cop, instead of coming to the logical conclusion, believes he's immune to acid and leaves happily after insulting and exposing himself to his dead partner. Rick is satisfied Morty has learned something: to \""never make fun of him again, ''ever''\"", and decides to head home (saying he wouldn't waste their home reality on this crap) lamenting that the reality they're in was nice, as Johnny Carson was still alive and on the air, 9/11 never happened and Rocky Road ice cream had peanut butter instead of marshmallows.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, the surviving cop goes on Johnny Carson's show proclaiming that he is immune to acid. He is lowered into a genuine vat, where he suffers a slow and painful death."

During the drive, Rick gets a call from an ex telling him he is the father of her children. Beth, determined that Rick will do for his new child what he never did for her, forces him to go to his ex and be a good dad. However it turns out that Rick's ex, Gaia, is an entire planet about to give birth to her first sentient species. Beth wants Rick to help the kids develop, and Rick agrees so the two of them set to work developing the society and helping them fly into space.\n\nMorty, Summer and Jerry go camping, but Morty and Summer make it clear they have no intention of going along with Jerry's camping trip. After Summer verbally blasts Jerry for wanting to bond with her in order to feel important, he leaves forlorn and accidentally gets thrown into a group of Rick and Beth's new society's rejects. With their basic brains, they love the idea of camping, so Jerry becomes their new leader. Morty and Summer go looking for him after a few days, only to find a crashed alien ship. Boarding it, Morty believes the controls are identical to his video game while Summer thinks the vapor the ship emits will grant her knowledge of how the controls and begins inhaling it. Soon she gets high off of the substance, and Morty tries to fly the ship. Meanwhile, a god-like being named Reggie arrives claiming he is the father of the children that Beth and Rick raised, and Gaia admits to Rick she made a mistake and doesn't know who the father is. Rick and Reggie both want to lay claim to the offspring, and quickly get into a fight. After a long brawl, Reggie gets the upper hand and tells Rick he has no intention of raising his kids but simply wants to strike the fear of god (who, as far as he is concerned, is himself) into them. However before Reggie can kill Rick, Morty and Summer dispatch him by accidentally driving the spaceship through his brain. Boarding, Rick finds Morty and Summer high, and thanks them for saving his life. Rick tells them that video games and drugs are the best, although also points out Summer wasn't actually doing drugs, but rather - inhaling brake fluid. Rick soon inhales the brake fluid.  \n\nWhile all this is going on, Beth's advanced Ricklets and Jerry's tribal Ricklets have gone to war with each other. However before the battle can go too far, Reggie's body falls on the city destroying it and killing many of the residents. Beth is sent flying over a cliff, and its left to Jerry to save her. He manages it, however the smell he now emits quickly quells any thought of thanking him for the rescue. Gaia is furious that her mate has been killed and forms an erupting volcano, the resulting lava killing most of the surviving society. Rick, Morty and Summer pick up Beth, Jerry and the last few survivors and fly off. The family finally leaves in their car, and gives the ship to the Ricklets (which Rick placing a tracer and a bomb on board, planning to blow it up if they come near Earth seeking revenge). \n\nAs the family flies off, Jerry reveals that he has learned a lesson from the experience, and tells the kids they were right about him, as he admits that he wanted to feel important, something that left Summer and Morty shocked. Jerry says there are times, where teenagers do have a point even if they are cruel, leaving the kids to feel guilty at their treatment. After Rick insults Jerry, Beth for once doesn't defend her father - and instead takes her husband's defense by voicing how Jerry saved her life, while criticizing Rick. This brings a smile to Jerry's face, and as Rick observes Jerry's smug look, Rick takes the opportunity to put them in their place and reassert control - telling Jerry and Beth they need to work on their parenting skills as Morty and Summer got high, went joyriding and killed Reggie. Beth and Jerry appear to be shocked and displeased that Rick is ratting out their kids who are equally shocked until listening to criticism.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Summer catches Rick looking at what appears to be a dating/porn website for planets. Although Rick claims he's only looking at it for the comedic potential, he's clearly aroused by what he sees."

Beth quickly ended most of them leaving one guard alive. She told the guard her name and tells him to say that the Defiance lives on to the top bugs. The bug guard agrees ensuring that he would make her a legend although it was making it difficult for him to construct such an idea since Beth's name is so plain. The bug guards then forgets Beth's name but then Beth kills him.\n\nThe next scene appears to be a secret base where Beth is stationed. Beth is being repaired on her shoulder while watching an ad about a planet-destroying machine. The doctor who is repairing Beth's arm tells Beth if she ever missed Earth. Beth tells him that she's aware that there was a clone of her on Earth making her \""technically\"" there. The doctor points out that Beth had a proximity device in her neck. He thinks that the bomb indicated that Rick didn't actually want Beth back and that he liked the clone better. He then offers Beth a drug to help her with her \""soul-crushing\"" but it was addictive. But he swaps out for the correct one and then he eats one.\n\nNow back on Earth, Beth is talking about Dr. Wong being open for family therapy. Rick then tries to act as if he was disintegrated but Morty points out that Rick simply used an invisibility belt. Jerry proves this by grabbing Rick's crouch causing Rick to uncloak. Morty says that he wanted to use the belt even though Rick never let him. Summer pitched in saying that if she can use the belt to piss of Morty. Rick gives Summer the belt with a smug look towards Morty. Summer turns invisible as Morty tries to take it from Summer. Beth stops Morty and says that both Summer and Morty should share it. Jerry enters with a puppet \""Mr. Nibbles\"". Morty then runs to catch Summer as she leaves the front door. Rick says to both Jerry and Beth that they can't control their kids and that it was a good thing Dr. Wong was available. Rick leaves the scene and enters into his garage where he commanded the garage into \""Family Therapy Mode\"".\n\nThe garage seals all openings with lasers and doors. However, the other version of Beth stands before Rick. Space Beth attacks Rick explains that the Beth on Earth has a similar device in her neck meant to transfer her Memories to space Beth and that Earth Beth is the clone. Space Beth is confused about why her clone got back together with Jerry, but Rick explains that, as they are the same person, she would have done the same thing. The two then decide to get a drink.\n\nMeanwhile, Summer uses the invisibility belt to break into a boy's room and go through his stuff, however, Morty stops and confronts her wearing a pair of infrared goggles. The two wrestle for a short time before managing to switch tech. Morty is going to leave with the belt, but Summer reveals that she knows that Morty is planning to go to cheerleading practice and can catch him in the act. Morty asks summer for a deal, with her saying that he can have the belt in an hour. He agrees and hands her the belt, but instead of giving him the goggles, Summer she smashes them before mocking Morty, only for him to reveal that he gave her his \""Tiny Big Man Junior\"" belt instead of the invisibility one. Morty then proceeds to turn invisible before leaving, leaving Summer to confront the boy whose room she broke into. Summer lies to the boy about having wandered away from her game console.\n\nRick and Space Beth converse at Shoney's, with Beth talking about her adventures and Rick pointing out how they seem similar to Star Wars. In turn, Beth brags about how she has become the most wanted person in the universe, much to Rick's surprise. The two are interrupted when they see a television report about the New Galactic Federation looking for Beth. Realizing that they would find Earth Beth, Rick lets it slip that Earth Beth might not be the clone. Space Beth attempts to shoot Rick, but he freezes her.\n\nAt the school, Morty uses the invisibility belt to try and peek on the cheerleaders in the shower, but Summer, knowing he would be there, pulls the fire alarm and sprays a fire extinguisher, coating Morty in the foam. Morty runs into the football field, and tries to clean himself off, Summer uses the opportunity to steal the belt and turn invisible. Morty tries to use the fire extinguisher on her, but it turns out to be empty. A New Galactic Federation ship then approaches, causing Morty to drop the fire extinguisher. Morty is about to be arrested, but a still invisible Summer picks up the fire extinguisher. Surprised the federation agents ask if Morty psychic, to which he lies and says yes. They explain they are looking for his mother and then ask of Morty can stop their hearts. Morty lies again, saying he can, and the agents then surrender without a fight.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Wong chastises Jerry's obsession with puppets as it makes him look dumb and crazy. Suddenly, the room explodes as Tammy and a team of Galactic Federation troopers storm the building with the intent of gong after Beth. While Tammy wants to kill Beth, she's under orders by her superiors to bring her in and arrest her for her defiance. Beth doesn't understand what Tammy means, but after seeing Space Beth's battle, she realizes that she's the clone all along. Suddenly, Rick arrives and has his smart guns kill everybody but the humans inside the building, including, to his reluctance, Dr. Wong. While Tammy holds Beth prisoner, Rick reveals that he added a lot of contingency plans inside the office, using one to burn Tammy alive before shooting her. Rick takes Jerry and Beth in his ship and flies away.\n\nAs the trio fly, they are followed by Space Beth and Galactic Federation ships. While Jerry suggests that Rick make a portal for safety, the latter refuses to as Morty and Summer are still out there invisible, before calling him a bad father. However, Beth calls Rick out on his hypocritical statement as he lied to her about being a clone, only for the latter to hesitatingly claim that Space Beth is the clone as Beth refused to leave, and he liked the idea of having a space daughter. Tired of being lied to, Beth crashes Rick's ship so she can speak with Space Beth, with both versions accusing the other of being the clone. Before Space Beth can kill Beth, a burned Tammy and a squad of Galactic Federation troopers surround them. Rather than decide which is which, Tammy simply has both Beths taken away on a NX-5 Planet Remover. Rick tries to sacrifice himself as he believes the Galactic Federation still thinks he's a high-value target, but Tammy reveals that the new leaders do not deem him that anymore as they know he could simply move to a new dimension when left alone. Suddenly, Tammy's gun is pulled away from her, and Morty, in a Galactic Federation ship, fires at the troopers. He reveals to Rick that he and Summer, who is invisible right now, have put aside their differences and are working together as part of their \""arc\"". After an invisible Summer takes Tammy down, Rick shoots her in the head as payback for making him go to a wedding, along with killing Birdperson which he realized should have been the first thing he said. However, the NX-5 begins to destroy the Earth, with a pissed and reluctant Rick realizing they have to do a \""Star Wars\"" in order to rescue Beth.\n\nRick and the family land in the NX-5's hanger bay and use Tammy's corpse to unlock the door to the main hallway. While Rick goes off to find Beth, he tells Morty and Summer to stop the NX-5 from destroying the city. However, the siblings are forced to leave without the invisibility belt as Jerry is using it to pee, but Morty is certain that they don't need it.\n\nIn their prison cell, the Beths wonder what their fate will be as Earth Beth feels she's the clone to Space Beth. After the two trade insults over their decisions on who they became, Rick announces to on the PA that he's coming to save one of the Beths if they are alive, but if they're both alive, then he suggests that they do not hurt each other as anyone of them could be the clone. Now realizing what a piece of shit father Rick is, the Beths escape their prison cell.\n\nRick enters a fight chamber and sees his old friend Birdperson, now Phoenixperson, come out to face him. Although dishearten to see his old friend now on the Galactic Federation's side, he tries to calm Phoenixperson by saying that he killed Tammy. However, Phoenixperson is not happy with this news as he loved Tammy, and the two begin fighting each other.\n\nMeanwhile, Morty and Summer find the laser controls, only to see two Galactic Federation troopers guarding it. They see that the NX-5 cannons are unable to destroy Wrangler jeans due to their sponsorship, which gives Morty and Summer an idea. Meanwhile, Rick and Phoenixperson continue their fight, but Rick starts to get overwhelmed by the latter.\n\nElsewhere, the two Beths work together and fight their way through Galactic Federation troopers to reach Rick. Back at the cannon station, Morty distracts the two guards by running past the doorway, leading them out of the room. That gives Summer the chance to go in and toss Morty's Wrangler jeans into the laser well, and the computer shuts down because of it. Morty comes back after killing the two guards off-screen, but Summer is disgusted to have seen her brother's balls.\n\nMeanwhile, Rick and Phoenixperson's fight goes outside, with the former getting blasted at and having his cybernetic guts ooze out of his body. Before Phoenixperson can kill Rick, the Beths arrive to help him, or at least kick his ass before he dies. However, it's not enough as Phoenixperson knocks the Beths out of the way before stomping on Rick's organs. Suddenly, Jerry comes out invisible and uses Tammy's corpse as a puppet, claiming that Rick lied about killing her, distracting Phoennixperson. While Jerry trips up and goes visible, his actions were long enough for Space Beth to shut off Phoenixperson. Afterwards, Morty and Summer come and see their two mothers.\n\nBack at home, the Smith family is okay with the idea of having two Beths as the kids like the idea of having two moms, and Jerry likes the idea of having two wives. However, Rick has a projector ready to reveal who the real Beth is, and shows that he mind-blew his memory of the reveal. That upsets the Beths even more as they now realize how much of a piece of shit Rick is, and refuse to look at the memory, claiming they don't need anything from Rick before leaving. Rick tries to entice Morty and Summer into seeing it, but they are not interested either as both Beths are badass and it's a win-win. Regardless, Rick puts the memory into the projector and watches the memory.\n\nIt turns out that after giving Beth the choice of staying on Earth or going off on her own, she asks Rick to make the choice for her as she wants to know what he really wants. Rick ends up making a clone of Beth and copies her memories into the clone, but then, he turns his back to the containers and has a machine randomize the Beth's so he could not tell who was who.\n\nAfter seeing this, Rick despondently realizes that he's a terrible father, before looking at the pieces of Phoenixperson, having recovered his old friend from the NX-5. However, Phoenixperson is still hostile towards Rick, forcing the latter to turn off his friend. Afterwards, Rick sits down, despondent that his actions have driven himself further from his family more than ever.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Jerry throws Rick's invisibility belt in the trash, only for it to turn the garbage truck invisible when it picks up the trash. A rich man then arrives driving his fast car and, despite Jerry's warnings, crashes into the invisible truck. Though he is glad that he survived, the car then explodes, killing him and causing the truck's drivers to flee terrified. Jerry proceeds to claim the invisible truck for himself, and becomes a vigilante, performing several \""heroic\"" feats, such as saving a prostitute from a pimp. However, when the truck runs out of gas, Jerry is forced to abandon it at a gas station, having been unable to find its fuel tank."

However, their ship and its controls are damaged beyond repair, and Rick passes out from his wounds before he can fix it. Realizing they're about to die either through re-entry or by the impact, Morty decides to call Jessica and confess his feelings for her, blaming the timing for not doing it sooner. However, Jessica reveals that she was interested in Morty for some time now, and asks to visit his house to watch a movie. Revitalized by this revelation, Morty tries to regain control of the ship, which he does at the last second, but he hits a palm tree that catapults him back into the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the nature of his wounds, Rick wakes up and sees where they landed, and in a panic, tries to flee with Morty, but is too late as his old arch-nemesis, Mr. Nimbus, appears and cries foul at Rick for violating an ancient treaty.\n\nBack at the Smith Residence, Rick is frustratingly preparing the table for dinner between himself and Mr. Nimbus. Despite Morty's attempts to get out of it, Rick assigns him to be \""booze guy\"" for the dinner as he leaves a few crates of wine in a \""[[Narnia Dimension|Narnia-like Dimension]]\"" as Mr. Nimbus prefers his wine aged to a few centuries. Mr. Nimbus arrives and controls the police to do random things after Jerry tries to call them to get him out of the house. Jessica arrives shortly after and is hurriedly rushed to the living room by Morty and gets her to choose anything she wants from the TV while he deals with Mr. Nimbus' demands for wine. Back at the Narnia Dimension, he encounters a couple who kept the wine safe for a few decades and give him love advice for his date with Jessica. However, once he returns, Mr. Nimbus consumes them both in a split second and orders Morty to get more, to his dismay. He goes back, only to find the deranged son of the couple he met just a few minutes earlier trying to kill him for the murder of his parents. Morty briefly leaves to regain his composure before returning, and kills the couple's now elderly son in front of his children. Realizing he told them the truth, they apologize to him shortly before dying of his wounds, and made a blood oath to kill Morty should he return.\n\nAs time goes by, the farm evolves into a fortress and then the fortress into a castle, with all of its inhabitants bent on killing Morty. They believe they accomplish this when he returns for more wine and they open fire on him forcing him to retreat. Fed up with all these setbacks, Morty equips himself with every weapon and armor he can get and massacres the entire castle of its inhabitants in a fit of rage. He finds the remainder of the wine and heads back, unaware that he left his levitation glove behind for a group of survivors to pick up.\n\nFinally done with all that, Morty gives all the wine to Mr. Nimbus, save for one bottle, which he smuggles to the living room for himself and Jessica to share. He tries to apologize for making her wait, but she ignores all that and kisses him. Before this can progress any further, they decide to drink up the wine and find a bottle opener, but Rick tries to drag him away to be a witness to the \""contract\"" that he and Nimbus are making. At the same time a dog-horse specimen named Adam (who is the son of the woman who found Morty's levitation glove in the ruins of the castle following its destruction at Morty's hands) dons a power suit, opens a portal and arrives in the kitchen with the intent to kill Morty. Despite his best efforts (and after being distracted by Mr. Nimbus), he is defeated by Jessica, who after finding the bottle opener, uses it to stab the tube connected to his suit. This causes his suit to implode (following a brief vision where Adam encounters a giant owl-like creature) and in turn, causes the tube to sever, flail and connect with the bottle opener which Jessica continued to hold in her left hand and consequently, sucks Jessica head first into the Narnia Dimension as it returns to it's point of origin.\n\nMeanwhile, Rick and Mr. Nimbus fight over terms when Rick snaps and yells at Mr. Nimbus, claiming he doesn't need anyone or him to make him feel better, though Nimbus suggests that he's turned into a hollow shell of himself because of Diane, causing Rick to strangle him. Meanwhile, Morty is tricked by robots into capture and sees Jessica, seemingly unconscious, encased in a crystal above him. While the scientist robot monologues as to why the society before them picked him for petty vengeance, Morty is able to break free of his restraints and free Jessica in the process. On the way back, they're surrounded by robots. Rick sees Morty and Jessica struggling to break free from a robotic tentacle and attempts to rescue them just to get rid of Mr. Nimbus, but he is dragged into the dimension as well and his weapons are stripped from him, forcing him to run into an enclosure with Morty and Jessica. Just as it all seemed lost, a huge wave of water along with an army of sea creatures rushes in and engulfs the entire dimension. It's revealed that Mr. Nimbus had secretly followed Rick and rescued him from the robots, causing Rick to reconcile with him.\n\nBack at the residence, Rick and Mr. Nimbus have started to get along well when Summer returns with a conch shell she acquired from fighting deep-sea creatures in the Mariana Trench, completely ruining their relationship once again, and Mr. Nimbus beats up Rick before controlling the police to arrest him. At the same time, Jessica, who unfortunately, is revealed to have actually been fully conscious for the centuries of time she spent in the crystal, has opened up to time and begins to philosophically rant to herself before calling off the date with Morty, saying they should just be friends. As she walks into the night, she flips off a nearby driver and declares herself to be a time god.\n\nAfterwards, Beth and Jerry head to Mr. Nimbus' place to take up an offer to a threesome with him after seeing his approval of them as a \""progressive couple\"" earlier. They start to have some doubts on pulling through with it until Mr. Nimbus opens the door, and the couple sheepishly dive into his arms."

Beth tells everyone Jerry is getting a job. Rick points this out as something wrong, then squid like creatures break into the house and shoot everyone one by one. Somewhere else, Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted is asking to be hunted, and the family tries to grab him until Rick's watch activates an alarm, showing that someone just killed a decoy family.  \n\n''<nowiki/>''\n\nIn the car, Rick explains that squid people are trying to hunt him down, and since the Space Beth incident, he has created various decoy families in various places around the country to protect themselves from any possible killers attempting to murder the family. However, the Smiths begin to argue, and as they do, the squids attack them from above and proceed to shoot their car to bits. However, they are quickly revealed as a decoy family. Another family is in Italy on vacation, and are ambushed and killed. In yet another house, a Rick and Morty notice that their decoy family has been destroyed and lock the house shut and proceed to watch a show about a time-travelling werewolf called ''<nowiki/>'When Wolf''' on interdimensonal cable. However, their commentary on the show is interrupted when more squid people attack them, bombarding their house regardless of the security.  \n\n''<nowiki/>''\n\n''<nowiki/>''\n\nIn yet another version of the Smith Residence, another Smith family takes notice. The five of them talk about it, and Summer asks if they are decoys themselves. This scares Rick as he tells Morty to check for a number on his butt. Morty looks and Rick farts. Jerry comes out with gluten-free, sugar-free, and lemon-free lemon squares, and Rick flies them in his Space Cruiser to one of the decoy houses. He enters and says the password, freezing them in place. Morty finds that the decoys are making decoys. Rick goes to his decoy and re-activates his head to ask questions before de-activating the being entirely. They drive around the countryside, and spot another Smith Residence created by another Rick, except Rick does not remember building them. They go to investigate, and another Rick says his password, freezing the other decoys. Seeing this, the first family hides as a second family comes into the scene. The second family unfreezes their decoy to ask questions, but realize that others are among them. Both sides accuse the other of being a decoy family, and they proceed to brawl, only to be destroyed by a fourth Rick and his family.  \n\nAfter Rick briefly explains what is happening, they disguise themselves as their mysterious squid opponents and shoot one of the ships down. They proceed to loot their ship, only to realize that the squids were actually a decoy family in disguise. A decoy Jerry throws a bomb, incinerating them. The commotion caused by the various decoy families has made various versions of themselves worried if they are decoys or real, leading to various deaths and families checking to see if they are real or not. One family is in the woods, fleeing the commotion when they are tranquilized by another decoy who takes them to his version of the Smith Residence. The decoy reveals himself to be a scarecrow-like version that was so poorly-made that he knew he was fake from the moment he was created; he harvests the skin of decoys to look more like them, and provides skin for his own version of the Smith family.  \n\nHowever, before he can skin them alive, a Glockenspiel version of the Smith family intervenes, saving the other Smith family from the scarecrow versions. They do not care for killing other decoys, instead saving as many as they can. They take their counterparts into a canyon, where a community of various decoys hides underground. The squids attack them, causing Glockenspiel Jerry to lock himself in the escape route with a can of varnish, effectively leaving the decoys to die. As another family kills a few decoys, their Rick ultimately decides to end the cycle by creating an Andross-styled beacon to attract the various decoys towards his version of the Smith Residence, all of which proceed to engage in an all-out battle royale, killing each other one by one until only one remains standing.  \n\nYet another version of the Smith family, disguised as lazily made decoys, take off their disguises and go into their Space Cruiser to investigate. However, one of the remaining versions shoots them from above, forcing them to fight. Ultimately, the ones that crashed win, but they are all killed by Mister Always Wants To Be Hunted, who was angered by the fact that he wasn't being hunted.  \n\nUp in space, what is presumably the real Smith family is wrapping up on an adventure with Space Beth when Rick's watch goes off, revealing the decoys were killed off once more, raising questions from his family.   \n\nMeanwhile, Glockenspiel Jerry escapes into the wilderness, takes off his clothes, puts the whole can of varnish onto himself and goes down the river. However, he is soon spotted by a group of beavers who use him as a crib for baby beavers. The water floods, putting him to sleep and he wakes to see he is stranded in a wasteland. The descendants of a dolphin and a woodpecker, who speak of him as a relic from a kinder past, take him to their place. Then, he wakes up as part of the ornament of a saloon mirror and sees green, reptilian cowboys who are surprised at him and burn him alive. Finally, he awakens a third time to see yellow humanoids living in their version of the Roman Empire and reenacting the origin of Christianity.  Glockenspiel Jerry awakens embedded on the cross of the yellow humanoid Jesus, laments his inability to die and says that this the worst thing that ever happened to anyone."

He is attacked by a Captain Planet-esque superhero named [[Planetina]], who defeats him with her elemental powers, impressing Morty. When Rick tosses an aluminum can on the ground, Morty recycles it, attracting her attention. He awkwardly invites her on a date, to which she accepts, flying away with him and shocking Rick.\n\nAt breakfast sometime later, [[Beth Smith|Beth]] expresses concern at the idea of Morty dating a woman who looks much older than him, which he shrugs off. [[Summer Smith|Summer]] laments Morty's success with women while she has been recently broken up with, and Rick invites her on a bar crawl across three planets that are all about to end via natural disaster, to which she accepts, despite [[Jerry Smith|Jerry's]] objections. Morty receives news of a wildfire and ignores Beth's protest, going to it with the hope that he may see Planetina.\n\nHe arrives just as she stops the fire and the two express their mutual attraction to each other. She mentions having \""kids,\"" but is actually referring to the Tina-teers, four people who carry elemental rings and summon her using them. The Tina-teers arrive on the scene, and Morty realizes that they control, exploit, and profit off of Planetina. While Planetina is being interviewed by a news team, the interviewer notices Morty and asks if they are dating. Planetina hesitates, but Morty claims that they are, to her delight.\n\nAs they fly to the first planet, Rick and Summer make a \""no attachments\"" deal in regards to any sexual encounters they may have. They arrive at the first planet, Morglutz. While there, Rick finds himself attracted to an alien named [[Daphne]], and goes off to have sex with her. Summer shouts after him to have fun and reminds him to not get attached.\n\nAt night, Morty stays up flirting with Planetina over text. He thanks her for the flowers she sent him, which are a massive amount grown to look like his face. She appears outside his window and the two have sex. As Summer and Rick leave Morglutz and the planet is destroyed, she hears a noise coming from the trunk, which Rick brushes off.\n\nAt a convention called Eco-Con, the Tina-teers summon Planetina to host a panel, but Morty is taken with her during the summoning, the two still asleep together. The Tina-teers dispel her and security drags Morty away. The fire elemental, Eddie, assures the dirt elemental that he will deal with Morty. On the second planet, Slartivart, Summer realized Rick has taken Daphne with him, leaving her furious at the violation of the rules.\n\nMorty, meanwhile, is tied up in a broom closet by security. Eddie reveals his plan to sell Planetina to a rich Arabic ambassador. He lights a mop on fire and attempts to burn Morty's face, but Morty knocks him down, frees himself, bites Eddie's finger off, and burns him and two guards alive with his own ring. He breaks into the conference room where Planetina is being sold, and kills the rest of the Tina-teers with their own rings, as well as two more guards and the ambassador.\n\nAfter the destruction of Slartivart, Summer struggles to ignore Rick and Daphne having sex in the back of the car. During a break, Daphne talks to Summer, revealing why Rick is so attracted to her: she has a pair of breasts on each of her elbows. Summer remains confident that Rick will dump her upon reaching the third planet, but Daphne casually disagrees.\n\nAt home, Morty reveals that he has invited Planetina to live with the family now that she is free from the Tina-teers. Beth is still disheartened by the age gap of the two and demands Planetina leave. Morty, enraged, confesses his love for her, and the two leave together, going off to stop natural disasters and environmental destruction. Without anyone reigning her in, Planetina becomes more violent, slashing the tires on a highway full of cars, burning down a congressman's mansion, and killing a mine full of workers in a fit of rage, horrifying Morty.\n\nOn the last planet, Ferkus 9, the citizens are having a planet-wide orgy while Rick and Daphne dance together. Summer tries to dissuade him, telling him that Daphne is just using him, which he denies. She takes the ship and flies towards the asteroid about to crash into the planet, destroys it, and comes back down, asking Daphne if she will continue to stay with Rick now that they are no longer in danger. She casually leaves, shocking Rick. As they fly home, Summer apologizes, and Rick tells her that while he is angry at her, it was very like him of her to stop an apocalypse just to prove a point. When she apologizes again, he brushes it off and tells her he would do the same if she needed it.\n\nMorty, alone in his room, is visited by Planetina. She begs him to try and make their relationship work, but he refuses, too disgusted by her actions at the mine. She insists that violence is the only way to save the Earth before bringing up how he killed her \""kids\"". Planetina then confesses her love for him but he sadly rejects her declaration. When he asks her to try and understand, she curses him out tearfully and flies away. Beth, hearing the argument, comforts a weeping Morty as the arrangement of flowers Planetina made of his face shows signs of decay. The song playing in the background is \u201cI Am the Antichrist to You\"" by Kishi Bashi.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an alien from Ferkus 9 who had sex with his father, believing the world was going to end, arrives at work the next day.

Curious, and to Beth's surprise, he quickly volunteers to work with her, with the purpose to use the mount to jerk him off. One week later, Morty relaxes at home, thinking back at his deed, before he notices a familiar barrel Rick brought back with him. To his shock, he learns that Rick borrowed a barrel of \""horse semen\"" from the hospital to create a bioweapon, to be used on an underground race of cannibalistic horse people called \""chuds\"" that he and Morty have been fighting. After Morty frantically convinces Rick not to test the semen to verify that it indeed belongs to a horse, Rick proceeds to work on his experiment. A power surge goes through it and the barrel explodes. When Morty comes to, he sees that the sperm have mutated into floating, toothy monsters that eat humans. Rick blames himself, believing he brought in a bad sample, much to Morty's guilt and relief.\n\nThe family is airlifted to the Pentagon's war room by [[the President]], where Morty agrees to lie for Rick and tells the President that they know nothing about the outbreak. The President brings in [[Professor Shabooboo]], the world's leading expert on sperm, who theorizes that the sperm will head to the Grand Canyon because of its vaginal shape. When he brings in a captured sperm monster and announces that he intends to analyze it, Morty shoots it to cover his tracks. At Morty's suggestion, the President sends Rick, Morty, the country's nukes, and a helicopter full of Marines to the Grand Canyon. The sperm, rapidly evolving, shoot down the plane with a trebuchet.\n\nRick, Morty, and two marines (one named Blazen that they believe to be incredibly cool) survive the crash, although the other marine is killed when the sperm attack. Morty saves a sperm with its tail stuck under a rock after it recognizes him as its creator, dubbing it [[Sticky|\""Sticky\""]]. In the war room, Summer comes up with an idea to create a giant egg for the sperm to flock to, but has her idea stolen by Shabooboo. Blazen leads them into the caves where the sperm are hiding, and ends up stabbing himself in the chest and accidentally revealing that he wears a thong, shattering Rick and Morty's image of him. He asks Morty to not tell Sports Illustrated model Kathy Ireland that he is wearing her thong. He then attempts to perform autofelletio on himself before the sperm devour him. They then freeze Rick in crystallized semen and the two are led to a talking sperm in a mechanical suit known as the [[Sperm Queen]], who reveals that Morty is the one responsible for their creation to a disgusted Rick.\n\nSticky breaks the two free and together they defeat the sperm. While Rick and Morty starting planting nukes along the canyon walls, they discover that the remaining sperm are all heading for Las Vegas. While expected due to the city's history, Rick wonders why now. It is revealed that Summer has volunteered an egg, and the soldiers have planted it on top of the Luxor, planning to shoot it into space after all the sperm enter the egg. Morty radios the President and finally tells him the truth, which horrifies him and the nearby Smith family; not only because of Morty's lack of self-control which led to the \""Space Sperm\"" but the realization that this will lead to the birth of an inbred biological child of Morty and Summer; in short, a \""Giant Incest Baby\"". The President orders Shabooboo to jettison the egg into space before any sperm can get to it, but learns that it will take thirty minutes with no way to bypass the timer. Shabooboo commits suicide to avoid any consequences after given credit for Summer's idea, while Rick, Morty, and Sticky are captured by chuds.\n\n[[Chud King|The Chud King]] plans to kill and eat the trio to punish Rick for having sex with his daughter, [[Ponietta|Princess Ponietta]], but she intervenes after revealing she is pregnant with [[Rick's Foal|Rick's child]]. She convinces her father to send the chud armies to fight the sperm. In Las Vegas, the chuds and government fight the sperm to stop them from reaching the egg. The Sperm Queen almost crawls to the top of the Luxor, but is pushed to her death by Sticky. Unfortunately, to everyone's horror, he fertilizes the egg himself out of instinct. Summer attempts to destroy her egg, but the President intervenes, claiming that the baby now exists thanks to a heartbeat and it is election season. With no other option, they launch it into space.\n\nMorty is met by Kathy Ireland, approaches Morty to ask if Blazen was wearing her thong when he died. Expecting that he was told to keep it a secret, she encourages him to be honest, even if it hurts people the truth pertains to. Morty tells her the truth and she leaves in disgust. Rick decides to commit to Ponietta as she gives birth to a human/chud hybrid that looks like Rick, but leaves with it without trouble, and Rick takes out a Staples \""Easy\"" button and presses it, causing it to say \""that was easy.\""\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an astronaut talks to mission control as he does maintenance on a satellite, discussing how his wife had a child to try and keep him on Earth, but he left her behind regardless. As he talks about how the guilt of this has affected him, the [[Naruto Smith|\""Giant Incest Baby\""]] rises up in front of him in a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey and begins shaking him. During it, the president and  mission control complain about him and his drama."

She leaves the kids alone under threat to not cause any trouble, while Rick orders them not to touch any of his things. Morty plans to invite over [[Bruce Chutback]], a new student at their school, and Summer agrees to help him impress Bruce in hopes of getting some in with him. \""Guy's night\"" is revealed to be Rick letting Jerry hang out with demons who feed off of misery, paying back a debt he owes them for selling faulty skinhooks.\n\nBruce arrives. Morty and Summer try to impress him with interdimensional cable and wine, but he is instead taken with [[Space Cruiser|Rick's car]]. The car's defense system comes online when they try to take it, but Summer and Morty convince it that Rick is in danger and they need to take it to go save him. They fly around the universe, showing Bruce different planets and smashing up anthropomorphic mailbox aliens called \""mailboxians\"" with a baseball bat.\n\nHer work conflict resolved, Beth tracks Rick and Jerry to a karaoke bar and watches the demons enjoying Jerry's fumbling. Rick admits he is using Jerry to keep the demons satiated, but Beth confronts them regardless. Having heard good things about her from Rick and wanting to meet Jerry's wife, they invite her to drink \""Essence of Hell\"" wine with them, and she accepts.\n\nMidway through their joyride, the car's system stops Bruce, Morty and Summer. It reveals that it has a recording of the entire night and plans to show Rick everything when he returns, using the time it has left to do whatever it wants and blame it all on the trio. The car uses a solar system as bait to catch and kill a gigantic god-like alien, then declares itself bored. It lets the kids get a meal before it takes them home and lets Rick punish them. Parking at a restaurant, it is dinged by a \""Changeformer,\"" a robot that can turn back and forth between a car. Believing the car is a Changeformer as well, he invites it to hang out with them at a galactic ski resort and leaves. Bruce gets the car to admit its insecurity about being a virgin and suggests helping disguise it as a robot, in exchange for it not telling Rick about the joyride, to which it agrees.\n\nA drunk Beth shares embarrassing stories about Jerry, which he takes in stride and does not understand that they are meant to make fun of him, only understanding when he overhears two demons talking about him while using the bathroom. Hurt, Jerry argues with Rick and Beth, boring the demons. They go on a rampage and kill everyone in the bar, taking Jerry through a [[Portal Technology|portal]] to Hell, with Rick and Beth pursuing.\n\nAt the ski resort, the car has disguised itself as a Changeformer, only to have its fake head knocked off when the one who invited it tries to get a kiss. As he insults the car, it lights the room on fire and kills all of the Changeformers in a rage. It escapes the planet with Bruce, Summer and Morty still inside, with police in hot pursuit. Worried that they will be killed if shot down, Morty ejects them from the car and the trio is arrested.\n\nRick and Beth disguise themselves as demons and infiltrate the chamber where Jerry is being held, but are ambushed by demons. When Rick tries to electrocute them, he finds that the pain only causes them pleasure, leaving him unable to attack. They plan to keep Rick and Beth to have someone to react to Jerry's miserable attempts at humor and give them more suffering to feed off of and raise them up on Rick's faulty skinhooks, but they crumble and allow the three to escape.\n\nThe kids are given a [[Alyson Hannigan|public defender]], which turns out to be the car, having killed their lawyer and put a chip in the corpse's head to control the body. The car tries to get Summer and Morty to give Bruce to the authorities, but they refuse, so the car blows up the body it is inhabiting and escapes with the three through a hole in the wall, blowing up the police station that was holding them.\n\nRick, Jerry and Beth kidnap a demon and restrain it to a wheelchair with a turret on top. Rick explains the turret shoots shrapnel that will convert the pleasure from pain back into pain, but needs Jerry's misery to power it. When Jerry refuses, Rick sincerely apologizes for misleading Jerry and admits that he does care about him, which ends up powering the turret. They use the turret to defeat the demons and portal out of Hell. Rick aggressively tells Jerry that guy's nights are over, which he takes in stride, to Rick's annoyance.\n\nBarely making it home in time, the kids collapse on the couch as the adults notice nothing suspicious. Bruce tells Summer and Morty that while he had fun, he wants to get a sense of what they're like via the school's opinions of them, negating the point of them inviting him over, and leaves. Summer and Morty conclude that Bruce is lame and decide to drink the wine that they offered him together.\n\nIn a post-credit scene, Bruce hangs out with the popular kids at [[Harry Herpson High School]], who all believe him to be cool, until Sharon Lewis points out that he wore the same pants the day before. They reject him and start calling him \""Bruce Chutpants,\"" which a watching Summer and Morty observe will stick to him.

Morty accidentally destroys the glass surrounding it, the Constitution itself, the Lincoln Memorial, the Liberty Bell, and the Statue of Liberty using a laser cutter, and a robot hidden inside the statue goes on a rampage. The government traps the two inside the Smith house. Two Soldiers attack but a satellite dish deploys a plant like alien which promptly devours the Two Soldiers. \n\nRick and The President both state their separate plans to get a presidential pardon/stop Rick to their parties. In the past, Rick had turned himself into a turkey and gotten a pardon from The President, so The President has sent out multiple armored trucks, only one of which contains the presidential turkeys and will be guarded by marines. Rick plans to sneak aboard by turning himself into a turkey before they arrive, because the human eye cannot recognize a turkey's face, but The President has a solution: turning several marines into turkeys, all of which swallow capsules that identify them as humans in turkey form.\n\nRick and Morty turn themselves into turkeys and distract the soldiers surrounding their house with robots. They land on top of the truck, knock out two turkey marines, and disguise themselves using the marines' headsets. The President, realizing Rick's deception, turns himself into a turkey, and enters the pen where turkeys wait to be selected for a pardon. He immediately recognizes Rick and the two fight. In the scuffle, Rick knocks out The President's identifying capsule, which is swallowed by a random turkey. The marines pull out the wrong turkey and inject it with The President's DNA, which turns it into a doughier, slightly feathery version of The President. The remaining turkeys are sent into an underground chamber where the unpardoned ones go, and are met by a polio vaccine-mutated Franklin Roosevelt, who has become a large human-spider hybrid. Rick and Morty turn back into humans, the President saves Rick and Morty, and Morty burns FDR alive. Rick makes a deal with the President to make him human again in exchange for a pardon.\n\nThe Turkey-President begins making large, muscular turkey-human hybrids as guards and sells states, giving the profit to congress to keep them satiated. Rick, Morty, and a now human President arrive on the scene, but congress, enjoying the Turkey-President's new leadership, vote to keep him. The three escape the turkey guards and have Thanksgiving dinner at Rick's house, where Rick and The President discuss what to do next. The group observes on the news that the Turkey-President is turning every turkey he can into turkey guards, making some the size of skyscrapers. The President rallies his marines, and they stage a plan to break into \""The Crypt of the New World\"", under the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nThe group fights through the turkeys, and The President, Rick, and Morty make it to the crypt. Pictographs on the crypt walls reveal that Americans had been fighting turkey dinosaurs for centuries. In the 15th century, a group of aliens crash-landed on Earth and fought off the turkeys, some still being preserved in the modern day. The President frees them, and they are revealed to be two races of alien\u2014one that resemble pilgrims, and another that resemble Native Americans, previously warring but now united by their hatred of turkeys. They easily massacre the turkey guards, while the trio are met by the Turkey-President, who sends the Washington Monument into space with the ray that turns turkeys into humans attached. Rick and Morty fly into space to stop it, while The President fights his turkey counterpart.\n\nRick fights more turkey guards in space, while Morty ends up destroying the Monument with the same laser cutter from the opening. The President defeats the Turkey-President, who blows himself up in a last-ditch effort to kill him. As The President sends the aliens back underground to hibernate, Morty laments that he doesn't know how to feel about America, now that he knows it was built on the backs of aliens. The President, looking at the destroyed monument and the burning grass around it, tells him to feel thankful.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the wife of a marine who had expressed worry about her husband being turned into a turkey shops with him and their baby. A basket of blueberries gets knocked over, and the husband experiences PTSD-induced psychosis from when he was a turkey, dropping down and pecking at the blueberries. As onlookers watch and remark that they won't pay for his healthcare, the wife weeps.\n==Characters==\n===Major characters===\n\n* [[Rick Sanchez]]\n* [[Morty Smith]]\n* [[The President]]\n* [[Turkey President]]"

It turns out to be a blue Gotron Ferret, one of five animatronic Voltron-like vehicles that Rick is obsessed with. While Morty tries to convince him to go to Boob World, Summer offers to help him take the Gotron back to Earth. As Morty watches them walk away, a voiceover not unlike one from a mafia movie sounds where he foreshadows dark times following the Gotron, until Summer cuts him off with her own voiceover, which Morty himself can hear.\n\nRick, Summer and Morty collect the other four Gotrons offscreen and propose to [[Beth Smith|Beth]] and [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] that they join them to stop an interdimensional monster. When Summer pushes them to accept, they all suit up and combine their Ferrets into a Gotron, a mechanical warrior that easily defeats the monster. Rick, overjoyed at the success of the fight, starts planning to get other Ricks the Ferrets they need to complete their collections. Morty tries to ground him, reminding him that Rick wanted to be calmed down if he got too obsessed, but Summer cuts him off.\n\nRick invites four other Ricks and their families to a barbecue, where he, the other Ricks, and his Summer discuss business. Their attempts at striking a deal angers a violent Rick named Hothead Rick, but Rick easily replaces him with another Rick after he leaves. The five Smith families combine their Gotrons to form a gigantic Gogotron, which easily dispatches all the monsters that cross over to their dimension. Summer continues to rise in the ranks, while Morty is treated like a common worker and Rick's obsession with the Ferrets leads him to abuse alcohol and other substances.\n\nAt a nightclub built to hide from enemies, Rick drunkenly announces his plans to build a Gogogotron, disgusting Morty. When he steps outside for some air, he is kidnapped by the original pilots of the Gotron Ferrets, five teenagers animated in an anime style, who the Ricks have been killing alternate versions of to get their Ferrets. They initially try to bribe him with Boob World currency in exchange for insider information about Rick's operation, but when he resists, he is forced to fight off an assassination attempt. When he makes it back to the nightclub, he finds Hothead Rick destroying it with his Ferret, killing a Rick and getting himself killed in the process. Summer has Morty thrown out of the operation.\n\nSummer fires her parents from the operation on a whim, while Rick hires Kendra, one of the original Ferret pilots, and her friends. Rick fires Summer. At home, Morty has calmed down from the high of the operation, while Beth and Jerry are readjusting and attempting to do the same. Summer comes in and apologizes profusely for her behavior. She confesses that her attachment to the family working together comes from an experience she had had\u2014[[Naruto Smith|her giant baby]] from \""[[Rickdependence Spray]]\"" had been captured by the United States government and held on Mars. The government took Summer to him, hoping her influence as his biological mother could turn him into a weapon, but she bonded with him and helped him escape. As the Smiths try to figure out what to do next, Summer mentions Kendra and Morty realizes the pilots are planning to kill Rick and take their Ferrets back.\n\nInside the Gogogotron, the pilots have trapped Rick inside the head and are about to kill him when the Smiths, riding on the head of the gigantic baby, (who Summer has named \""Naruto\"") arrive. Naruto smashes the Gogogotron apart, killing all the pilots and rescuing Rick. Morty and Summer tell the audience in voiceover that life returned to normal after that, Rick lost his interest in Ferrets, and monsters continued to ravage worlds unstopped. As they continue to monologue, Rick pulls alien worms out of their ears and kills them, which he dubs as parasitic \""voiceovarians.\""\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a task force of bug monsters prepare to enter an interdimensional portal, so they can tell anyone they meet about the cure for AIDS. One cadet asks if the citizens of the other dimension will understand them, and the captain insists that going through the portal will not \""strip us of our clothes and make us screaming monsters.\"" As the cadets head through the portal, one comes out on the other side and tries to communicate the cure, but is shot as his presence is perceived as an attack."

When they leave, Rick goes to the [[The Garage|garage]] and activates \""Best Friend Rejuvenation Sequence,\"" which brings the cybernetic, half-dead [[Birdperson]] out of the wall Rick had stored him in in \""[[Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri]]\"". Rick removes his cybernetic parts and tries to bring him back to life, but Birdperson only wakes up for a second, sees Rick, and promptly falls unconscious again. Rick's Garage AI reports that Birdperson has hidden his conscious mind inside his unconscious mind. With no other choice, Rick enters Birdperson's mind to save him.\n\nRick arrives, nude, in the memory of their meeting at an alien music festival, using a bystander to point him towards Birdperson. He goes through a memory of a battle between Rick, Birdperson, and several [[The Citadel|Citadel of Rick]] agents, before landing in a memory of Rick, Birdperson, Squanchy, and several other Resistance fighters planning \""The Battle of Blood Ridge\"". Memory Rick notices him and Rick reveals to him that he is just a sentient memory, before incapacitating him and finishing a device that lets him track Birdperson through his mind.\n\nHe finds Birdperson observing a memory of him and [[Tammy Guterman|Tammy]] together. Birdperson rejects his rescue attempt and flies away just as [[Gromflomites|Gromflomite]] soldiers attack. Memory Rick joins Rick in the fight and the two win, going off to find Birdperson. In the garage, both Rick and Birdperson are having a seizure. The AI that control Rick's garage notices neighbor [[Gene]] walking by, and convinces him to bring it as many batteries and solar panels as possible.\n\nThe Ricks track down Birdperson to a large red crystalline tree. They split up, Memory Rick entering Birdperson's memories suppressed by the [[Galactic Federation|Federation]] after being transformed into Phoenixperson. Rick finds Birdperson making bombs out of rage, and, upon seeing Rick, he detonates them in an attempt to destroy his own mind. Memory Rick sees Birdperson's death as the tree begins to collapse, and the Ricks run, not before Rick stops at the memory of his fight with Birdperson in \""Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri\"", defeats Birdperson, and orders himself in the memory to give him his clothes. The destruction of the tree turns all of the [[Bird People]] nearby feral.\n\nThe Ricks go through the \""PTSD-Station\"" to get to Birdperson, and end up in the Battle of Blood Ridge. Memory Rick, eager to see it, is delighted to find that the Resistance easily wins the battle, mostly because of the efforts of Rick and Birdperson. As Rick looks for a way out, Memory Rick observes that after the battle, Rick offered to take Birdperson to whatever reality they wanted to go to and stop fighting, but Birdperson rejected it, stating that it was not worth his integrity.\n\nBirdperson has taken a Memory Tammy to watch the sunrise with him at their home, and both are ambushed by the Ricks. As Rick argues with Birdperson to try and take him back, he reveals that both him and Memory Rick had learned that Birdperson and Tammy had a [[Birdperson's Daughter|child]]. Birdperson decides he will live for his child, held by the Federation, just as the memory Federation attacks. The four steal a Federation car and drive through Birdperson's memories.\n\nRick reminds Birdperson of a time when they used the mind erasing gun on Jerry and they travel to Rick's garage, where they retrieve the gun. Rick explains that to reach the exit, they need to use memories that Rick and Birdperson share mainly rooted in anger and sadness to \""lily pad\"" their way to a happier memory of their first meeting where they indulged in the use of the illicit Federation substance [[Senthol Diempathate]]. They travel through a funeral of a friend, Squanchy's attempt at stand-up comedy, and Rick, Birdperson, and Squanchy's band. As they arrive at a portal that will take them out, they are attacked by another Tammy, who Memory Rick throws into the abyss along with himself. A black, bird-like goo creature attacks, Birdperson says goodbye to Tammy, and Rick and Birdperson fly out of his mind.\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the collapse of his brain's neural pathways and regaining consciousness, Birdperson confronts Rick over not telling him about his incarcerated child until it was \""necessary to save\"" himself. Disappointed, he leaves just as Gene arrives with his batteries. Panicking, the garage pretends to not know him and shuts the door. However, Rick is not angry and tells the garage that he understands.\n\nMeanwhile, it is shown Memory Rick is still alive after transporting himself inside Rick's brain. Rick finds him and offers to make him real to get a drink, Memory Rick follows but hesitates realizing that doing so would mean he eventually becomes present Rick.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Birdperson's daughter is picked on by an inmate in a Federation prison, and is seen attacking him before being dragged away."

As he finishes his bucket list, he returns to the garage only to find that Rick had marked a notch on his container of portal fluid so he would know if Morty used the portal gun. Panicking, Morty mixes Mountain Dew with the remaining fluid, which the gun seems to accept. He accidentally spills the remaining portal fluid on his palm, which creates a small portal that regurgitates junk and shows him a man named [[Nick]], who tells Morty he has a portal on his thigh, referring to it as his \u201cstash hole.\u201d\n\nRick finds out that Morty tampered with the gun, and, furious, decides to have Morty replaced by a wheel of names, deciding on two crows. Nick, somehow familiar with Rick, cites their relationship as abusive and encourages Morty to embrace this change, while Rick easily catches and trains two crows. Morty tracks Nick down, finding him in a mental hospital. A sheepish Nick explains he met Rick at a bar and became too curious about his portal gun, leading Rick to shoot him out of a catapult and force a mental breakdown. Using their portals, Morty and Nick fight off the hospital's abusive staff and dub themselves \""The Portal Boys\"".\n\nWhile on a mission, the crows try to save a group of tortured aliens over a valuable artifact, leading Rick to dump them on a planet of intelligent crow aliens. The aliens pull down his ship, offended at the notion of him abandoning their kind, and help Rick become more in tune with the crows. Nick and Morty break into the garage, where Nick helps Morty vent his rage against Rick by wrecking the place and taking an empty prototype portal gun. When Rick returns to Earth with the crow aliens and sees the trashed garage, they notice the wheel and realize Rick's crow training was all an elaborate joke. Furious, the aliens turn all nearby crows feral and take Rick's crows, with him pursuing.\n\nNick and Morty go to Rick's portal fluid supplier and things turn violent when Nick pulls a gun. He incapacitates Nick when he shoots unarmed civilians and flees. As Rick breaks onto the crow ship and is quickly captured by the aliens, he gets a call from Morty and answers. Morty apologizes for lying to him, and Rick admits the crows were just a bit. Hearing this, his crows allow themselves to be transformed into crow aliens by a large energy egg. His crows pretend to attack him, but actually reattach their laser wires and use it to kill the aliens and destroy the egg, which changes them back.\n\nMorty is attacked by Nick, who runs his car off the road and corners him on a set of train tracks. He inadvertently reveals his story of Rick hurting him to be a lie, and Morty, realizing he has to disconnect their portals, severs his hand under a train wheel and drops it in Nick's thigh, creating a singularity that destroys him. Seeing Morty outside the house while flying down in a crow ship, Rick regrows his hand and rejects their partnership, declaring himself a bad partner and that Morty would be better off without him. Morty watches tearfully as Rick cleans out the garage and waves goodbye, leaving in a crow ship to start the \""Rick and Two Crows\"" show, which he announces to no one in a drunken ramble.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an alien that eats Rick's trash which has been dubbed \""Garbage Goober\"" is confronted by his wife. She reminds him that his work is not what he signed up for and that he is a doctor and deserves respect. When Garbage Goober finally agrees to ask the family for dignity, [[Summer Smith|Summer]] offers him trash to eat, he eagerly leaves to go consume it."

Some time later, Rick is approached at a bar by a now middle-aged Morty, claiming Rick has been gone so long that [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] has died of cancer and [[Summer Smith|Summer]] has gotten married to a junkie. He begs Rick to come home, but Rick again rebuffs him.\n\nThe crows sneak out at night to plan adventures with Crowscare, Rick's nemesis. Realizing the crows were using him to get over a breakup the same way he used them, Rick returns home, only to find Morty was lying and he took aging serum from the [[The Citadel|Citadel of Ricks]] to emotionally blackmail him. After Morty gets properly re-aged, he notices a deformed Morty raving about the Citadel being an inescapable weapon of mass destruction, before he is shot by the police. [[President Morty]] invites the two to have dinner with him, with Rick expressing doubt and planning to leave if things go awry.\n\nOver dinner, President Morty hints that Rick built the Citadel and requests information from Rick on how to \""bring down the [[Central Finite Curve]].\"" When Rick refuses, President Morty reveals he kept [[Evil Rick Sanchez|Evil Rick]]'s partial scan of Rick's brain from \""[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]\"", having completed it as Rick had been sitting at the table, and states he has enough to do what he needs. When Morty apologizes to Rick for bringing him to the Citadel, President Morty, disgusted, uses the brain scanning device to show Morty visions of Rick, as leader of the Citadel, previously having had Mortys tortured, used as labor, and having their parents' lives tampered with specifically to create more Mortys. He allows the two to leave, but Rick realizes his portal gun has been hacked (with internal coordinates locked to the [[Blender Dimension]]) after shoving a Rick guard into it and seeing the result. Rick C-137 then recognizes President Morty as an \""evil\"" variant he had previously personally encountered, the only person to have ever hacked his portal gun.\n\nThe Citadel's portals go haywire, killing anyone who tries to step into them, despite broadcast warnings instructing them not to. Rick and Morty go underground to try and find untapped portal fluid, seeing more deformed Mortys being used as slave labor. When Morty presses Rick on his involvement with the Citadel, Rick gives him the brain scanner and Morty uses it to see Rick's backstory.\n\nAfter [[Beth Smith|Beth]] and [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]]'s murder at the hands of [[Rick Prime|another Rick]], (first shown in \""[[The Rickshank Rickdemption|The Rickshank Redemption]]\"") Rick C-137 perfects his [[Portal Technology|portal technology]] and uses it to explore dimensions and do research. He begins selling weapons and murdering those who cross him, later meeting [[Birdperson]] and joining the fight in the resistance before immediately going their separate ways after the Battle of Blood Ridge. He sets his sights on killing the Rick who murdered his family, massacring hundreds of versions of himself to find his target. A large number of Ricks of the multiverse hold a conference to decide how to stop Rick, who decides to crash the meeting, kill the speaker, and jadedly slaughter a large number of the audience with explosives. After Rick eventually tires of it, the survivors assemble into the [[Council of Ricks]] and, with Rick's assistance, built the Citadel. Upon finishing, he crash-lands on [[Cronenberged dimension|a version of Earth]] where [[Beth Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Beth]] is still alive and takes up residence there, taking Morty as his sidekick.\n\nThe two reach the Citadel's Dimensional Drive, where Evil Morty explains the Central Finite Curve is a multidimensional wall that separates all the infinite universes where Rick ''isn't'' the smartest man alive from all the infinite universes where he ''is'' the smartest man alive. Evil Morty intends to break through it so he can live away from Rick entirely. He claims that what makes him \""evil\"" is hating Rick and wanting to leave, and if any Morty has ever felt the same, then they are \""evil\"" as well. Doubtful, Morty asks Rick if he came back to him because he got over the crows, or because they got over him: Rick is unable to answer. At the same time, Evil Morty switches on the machine, which is powered by the blood of hundreds of [[Operation Phoenix]] clones, all rerouted to the Citadel.\n\nSeeing Rick's deception once again, Evil Morty offers Morty a chance to come with him. Rick himself acknowledges that it is a better deal than staying with him, but Morty rejects this and opts to stay with his grandfather. The portal gun empty, the two escape the Citadel by detaching part of it and flying away, loading it up with Mortys and activating the booster together just as Evil Morty uses his machine to tear open the Curve and launch himself through it in a small spaceship. Coming out on the other side, he sees the rest of the [[multiverse]] and smiles while he activates a hologram from his wrist that shows all of the universes that make up the Central Finite Curve popping and disappearing. Finally, he opens a gold portal with an improved gun and steps through it.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] talks to the audience about the end of the \""Evil Morty\"" arc and the collapse of his relationship with his wife after Rick caused him to lose his job in \""[[One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty]]\"", hypothesising about becoming \""Evil\"" himself (shown in \""[[Never Ricking Morty]]\"").

In the Cronenberged dimension, Morty encounters his [[Jerry Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|dad]], who travels by himself after the deaths of his [[Beth Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Beth]] and [[Summer Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Summer]] and has adapted a Rick-like nihilistic philosophy: he rejects Morty's attempts to reconnect, reminding him that he abandoned the dimension and his family twice. Rick arrives to pick up Morty and reveals that the Cronenberged dimension is, in fact, Rick Prime's home dimension, and that Rick had originally settled here in hopes that he would one day catch him if he returned. They break into Rick Prime's lair, finding either him or a clone of him in a tube while pre-recordings of Rick Prime mock him. Rick goes on the offensive, once again wanting revenge for what Rick Prime did to his family, but Morty convinces him to stand down by reminding him he has a family back in [[Dimension C-131|a different dimension]] to worry about.\n\nSpace Beth finds herself caught up in a dispute between Beth and Summer, with Summer trying to bond with Space Beth as her cool \""space mom.\"" The pair of Beths argue over this while raiding the Citadel and fighting off five-dimensional monsters that came from the wormhole, though Summer is able to convince them to back down. After Rick and Morty return and save them from some aliens, they retrieve Jerry from his original dimension, one where the divorce never happened and the Smith family relationship is pretty much where it was in [[Season 2]] \u2013 making Jerry appreciative of the [[Season 3|brief period]] where he and Beth divorced. Before leaving, Jerry scolds his original family for their behavior and proclaims himself an interdimensional traveler.\n\nThe family returns to [[Dimension C-131]], where they encounter [[Jerry Smith (C-131)|the Jerry]] who was brought back to the house and has been taking a shower upstairs while waiting for them to sort everything out. However, he accidentally unleashes a cute but deadly parasitic Boogens named [[Mr. Frundles]] that takes over the world in mere seconds, forcing the entire family plus Space Beth to move to ''yet another'' [[Parmesan Dimension|replacement dimension]], where they coincidentally died at the exact moment of \""natural\"" causes \u2013 the only major difference is that residents of this dimension pronounce \""parmesan\"" strangely. In the new dimension, Beth and Space Beth make peace with each other, while Morty asks Rick if he's being used as bait for Rick Prime. Rick affirms that Rick Prime simply does not care about his family, remarking that in some ways, Rick Prime is the \""real deal\"".\n\nIn the [[Cronenberged dimension]], Jerry encounters none other than Rick Prime himself (he really had been inside the tube), who inquires about the whereabouts of Rick and Morty. Jerry feigns interest in an alliance to defeat the two before slashing Rick Prime's throat. Rick Prime reveals he can heal quickly and promptly shoots Jerry, expressing some admiration for Jerry's unusual ruthlessness before finishing him off and wondering how he got into the the Cronenberged dimension."

Morty, who was playing ''[[Roy: A Life Well Lived]]'' when the gang attacked, becomes trapped in the game with his mind spread out across the various NPCs, forcing Rick to go into the game as [[Roy]] to try to get Morty out. Summer, in the meantime, is instructed by Rick to \""do a ''Die Hard''\"" to fight back against the aliens (who as it turns out are led by a certified expert on ''Die Hard'') even though she has not seen the movie. Ultimately, she uses this to her advantage, taking the aliens by surprise by not following tropes used in ''Die Hard''.\n\nInside the game, Rick as Roy's attempts to explain to the NPCs that they are all his grandson stuck in a video game is interpreted as starting a cult/religion, leading to a religious conflict of sorts. In order to get Morty out with his mind intact, Rick has to get all of the Mortys to agree to fly into space beyond the barriers of the game. With the help of a Morty named [[Marta]], they manage to get up to 92% to agree, but 8%, who have long since also realized they are in a video game, express that Rick is actually a jerk to them and they are better off in the game. Marta-Morty asks Rick to tell them he loves Morty and they will all agree to leave, but Rick's awkward hesitancy only proves their point. Decades pass in the game, as Marta joins the opposing side in rejecting Rick's attempts to free them. Eventually, she loses her will to keep fighting as some of the Morty NPCs age out and even her own children decide to join Rick. She commands the Mortys to leave the game, but tells Rick she herself will remain behind.\n\nRick and Morty are freed from the game just in time to help Summer, who manages to one-up the alien gang one last time by reading a plot summary of ''Die Hard'' and actually doing one of the tropes for once (i.e. taping a gun to her back). The three depart Blitz and Chips, but not before it is revealed to the audience that Rick paid for the ''Roy: A Life Well Lived'' game to remain powered on to allow Marta-Morty to live out the rest of her life in peace.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the gang of aliens tries to do ''Die Hard 3'', made difficult by the fact that their previous leader died playing the Hans Gruber role at Blips and Chitz."

During her stay, her relationship with Beth develops after they bond over a bottle of Venusian wine. Eventually, their casual flirting develops into a full-on love affair. [[Summer Smith|Summer]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] notice this first, and quickly become obsessed with playing an ultra-realistic alien video game in a bid to avoid thinking about it. Rick figures out what\u2019s going on and tells Beth while he understands (having done something similar himself over the years), she needs to think about how this will affect her family: he, Morty, and Summer quickly become concerned about Jerry, who had previously claimed he would kill himself if Beth left him. When Beth begins to express doubts, Space Beth admits to the affair in front of Jerry, who promptly rolls up into a pillbug (a protocol Rick built into him that he\u2019d forgotten about). Rick reveals that Jerry can only emerge from the pillbug by his own choice, and trying to force him out will only make things worse.\n\nWhile Rick joins Morty and Summer in focusing on realistic video games, the two Beths soon find their fundamental difference in how they think of Jerry: Space Beth thinks he's pathetic and would rather leave him in the pillbug shell, while Beth still loves him and tries to encourage him to come out. Eventually, the two Beths decide to wipe their knowledge of each others\u2019 existence using Rick's Memory Wiping Machine, despite Rick pointing out this would just leave the rest of the family to deal with the knowledge of what happened. Jerry, overhearing this, leaves the shell and declares he won\u2019t let them lobotomize themselves over him, but says he is still leaving Beth. Eventually, it emerges that Jerry is more upset that the two Beths hooked up behind his back than the fact they did it and he actually quite enjoys being cuckolded. As Rick, Morty, and Summer uncomfortably listen from the dining room table, Jerry and the two Beths have an increasingly sexual conversation that culminates in all three of them hooking up. Rick is forced to calm Morty and Summer down as they finally break down over the situation.\n\nSpace Beth bids the family goodbye while promising to keep an eye out for her [[Naruto Smith|space grandson]]. Rick quickly gets rid of the Venusian wine that apparently caused the two Beths to fall for each other.\n\nDuring a post-credits scene, Jerry visits the [[Jerryboree]] in an apparent attempt to pull the same love affair with himself that Beth did. He is not permitted to by the receptionist, due to the Jerryboree having an issue with this in the past, but he runs into a stray Jerry on the streets with a similar desire. The two share a quick kiss before deciding their curiosity is satisfied and quickly part ways."

However, she is startled by [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]], who is doing crunches on the floor in the living room. Rick then leaves the room without saying a thing. At breakfast, Rick explains to Beth that what she saw was his \""night person.\"" Rick had purchased a machine called a \""Somnambulator\"" from the Goobie-Joob System, which allows him to program his unconscious body to do things while he sleeps that he doesn't have time to while awake. As a result, he now has washboard abs thanks to Night Rick working out so much. Naturally, the rest of the family want a piece of the action and request to have night versions of themselves. Rick initially refuses, but eventually gives in.\n\nAt first, the family is quite content with their night selves, as well as doing chores. Beth learns how to play the trumpet, Summer learns Spanish, Morty joins Rick in his squats and gets his own impressive abs (with the two starting a podcast on the subject) while Jerry becomes pen pals with Night Jerry. However, one day, Jerry tells Rick that he had a request from Night Summer that the day family start rinsing their dishes when using them so that she doesn't have difficulty washing them. Rick reacts angrily, telling the rest of the family that he has no intention of doing that, as the whole point of having night people is to do the shit that the day people don't want to do. The next morning, the Smith family wakes up to find all their dishes have been broken by their night selves in defiance. Rick responds by calling in a favor from a devil-like alien on another planet to make unbreakable plates.\n\nThat evening, the Night Family retaliates. Led by Night Summer, they strap Rick down and force him to eat the leftover residue on the plates, making him vomit. They also get rid of all the house's furnishings and hide the Somnambulator to stop Rick from destroying it (as that would destroy the Night Family). Taking this as a declaration of war, Rick creates a suit to keep Summer awake and has her go undercover that night to find the Somnambulator and destroy it. Unfortunately, this fails, as Night Summer takes control just before Summer can do this. Night Rick cuts Day Rick off from all his technology and builds robots to enslave the Day Family. \n\nAfter days of working as slaves, the family is able to escape with the help of Night Jerry (through his friendship with Day Jerry) and try to make a run for it; however, each time one of them is knocked out or tranquilized by the robots, their night versions take over, leaving the others to try and wake them up. This leads to a car chase as each member of the family is knocked out and woke up several times, adding more chaos and confusion to the situation. Eventually, Night Summer offers Day Rick a truce; they'll let the Day Family go if they promise to rinse their dishes. Day Rick still refuses, so the Night Family takes complete control.\n\nMonths later, after going on several expensive vacations and living lives of luxury, the Night Family are completely destitute, realizing that the Day Family were the ones who properly handled the finances. Deciding that being in control isn't worth it anymore, the Night Family destroy the Somnambulator themselves and release the Smith family. Everyone wakes up disorientated, and Rick checks to see what has been going on and discovers the terrible news that the Choco Taco has been discontinued, to everyone's devastation."

Jerry complains about the place giving him diarrhea, although the others point out that it wouldn't have happened if he hadn't eaten the food meant for the animals. The meal over, the family are given their fortune cookies, with Summer pointing out they only comes true when the cookie is eaten first. Although the rest of the family is given generic meaningless ones, Jerry's fortune reads ''\""You will have sex with your mother\"".''\n\nJerry starts getting paranoid that the fortune might come true, despite the fact he obviously would never have sex with his mother. Beth implores him to ignore it, while Morty and Summer find it hilarious and play various pranks on Jerry (including hiding a stuffed doll made to look like Jerry's mom in his wardrobe which falls on him repeatedly making it look like it's performing fellatio). Jerry's nerves get worse when he mother starts calling him more since he's trying to ignore her and begs Rick to investigate or use science to make it impossible. Rick refuses stating that using science to make something impossible usually ends up making it more possible. \n\nJerry becomes so paranoid that he tries taping up his genitals and even starts dressing like Morty, since Morty's mom is Beth. Space Beth arrives to pick the family up for the zoo trip, but Rick asks Jerry to stay behind as he's been getting strange readings from Jerry's probability field regarding the fortune. The rest of the family leave, and Rick admits that he made that up the strange readings to get Jerry out of going to the zoo, and admits that as much as he dislikes Jerry he has the right to take this seriously. Turning on his device, Rick is startled to find that Jerry's fortune is registering and decides to run a test by getting two boxes with holes, writing Jerry's mom's name in one and asking him to choose one hole he would stick his penis in. Rick repeats the test several times, sometimes switching the boxes and is worried when Jerry keeps picking the mom box. Rick decides to do something he would never willingly choose to do... go to Panda Express. He reasons that someone is trying to get his attention (mentioning that all the restaurant had to do was get a liquor licence).\n\nArriving with Jerry and announcing his presence to the backroom staff, he finds himself in a shootout which he is easily able to handle killing most of the employees. However he finds that the Panda Express staff are actually running a meth ring (which obviously Rick doesn't mind due to his aversion to the concept of laws) and have nothing to do with the fortune cookies which they get from the usual distributor. Apologising to the two remaining staff for murdering their colleagues (which they accept, saying it's part of the risk), Rick agrees to not turn them in to the cops in exchange for the truck that delivers the fortune cookies.\n\nTaking the truck to the factory where the fortunes are made, they find them coming from a building which is way too extravagant for a company that makes something that's given away for free. Entering and dodging the retinal scans, they find hundreds of similar trucks and cameras everywhere. Rick changes his clothes to blend in by calling on the Eye of Thundera, then makes Jerry look like an assistant with a transformation sequence lifted from Sailor Moon.  "
