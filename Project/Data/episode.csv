While driving his newly-built [[Space Cruiser|flying vehicle]], Rick explains that he made a [[neutrino bomb]]: he has decided Earth needs a \""fresh start,\"" and to that end, he wants to destroy humanity, planning to start over with Morty and [[Jessica]] as the new \""Adam and Eve.\"" Morty tries to \""take control of the situation\"" by taking the wheel of the vehicle. Rick eventually decides to land the vehicle, and when he does, he says it was all a test to get Morty to act more assertive. He passes out, and the bomb announces that it is armed and (presumably) activates.  The next morning, Morty falls asleep at breakfast. His mother [[Beth Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Beth]] is concerned, and Morty's older sister, [[Summer Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Summer]], explains that he was out with grandpa Rick. This causes an argument between [[Jerry Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Jerry]] and his father-in-law. Rick points out that he thinks school is an utter waste of time; before leaving the room, he compliments the breakfast which his daughter Beth made, causing her to cry tears of joy and stop being angry with her father, much to her husband Jerry's annoyance.  At [[Harry Herpson High School|school]] later that day, [[Mr. Goldenfold]] administers a math test, and Morty falls asleep, sinking into a dream filled with numbers. The dream quickly, however, evolves into a sexual encounter with Jessica, in which she asks him to play with her exposed breasts. Mr. Goldenfold unwittingly finds himself on the receiving end of Morty's subconscious fantasy. Later, Morty is accosted by a bully named [[Frank Palicky|Frank]]; appearing out of nowhere, Rick uses a [[Freeze ray|freeze-ray]] to stop him and convinces Morty to skip History because he needs \""an extra pair of hands\"" in another dimension. Rick and Morty then leave school, leaving Frank frozen and teetering in the hallway. Walking by (and not realizing that he is frozen or just doesn't care), Summer tries to impress Frank, but the front of his foot cracks, and he topples, shattering into pieces on the floor as Summer screams.  On his lunch break, Jerry visits his wife Beth while she is performing heart surgery to invite her to lunch, but she declines. He then proposes that they should put Rick in a nursing home, eliciting an aggravated response from Beth who lashes out at a nurse.  In an alleyway, Rick opens a portal in a wall, and Rick and Morty both step into it, emerging onto a hillside in a colorful and oddly-shaped world. Rick tells an awestruck Morty that they are in [[Dimension 35-C]], and explains that he needs [[Mega Seeds|mega-seeds]] from [[Mega Trees|mega-trees]] for his research. When Morty expresses his anxiety about the strange situation, Rick tries to calm Morty down with a speech about facing your fears, but he is suddenly interrupted by a strange arachnid-like beast which chases them as Rick openly proclaims that he has never seen anything like it before and that they are going to die. After escaping the monster and passing by several other monsters, Rick interrupts another set of objections by Morty, directing Morty's attention to a grove of mega trees at the bottom of a steeply walled valley. After refusing to answer Morty as to what the nature of the mega seeds is, Rick gives Morty some [[grappling shoes]] with which to scale the wall. Morty steps over the edge and falls off the cliff, as Rick neglected to tell Morty to turn the shoes on.  Meanwhile, Jerry and Beth are still arguing about whether or not to put Rick in a retirement home. Beth is upset, believing that her husband Jerry is trying to rob her of her father, who has only recently moved in with them, while Jerry believes that Rick is a terrible influence on their son Morty and needs to go. After a brief interruption by Beth's assistant, [[Davin]], Beth counters her husband's argument, saying that Morty was having trouble in school before Rick moved in with them; the fact that Morty has a friend is more important to her than any potential detriment. The principal of school, [[Gene Vagina]], calls, asking the couple to come to the school and talk to him.  Back in Dimension 35-C, Morty lies on the ground at the bottom of the cliff, his legs terribly broken in more than three places. As Rick lectures Morty on the folly of failing to turn on the shoes, Morty yells at Rick for his indifference, and for his singular focus on the mega-seeds, rather than his injuries. Rick then leaves Morty, disappearing into a portal for a number of seconds before returning and injecting Morty's legs with a [[Pure Curum|serum]] which cures Morty's broken legs. With his legs fully functional again, Morty uses his grappling shoes to get the mega-fruit, while Rick explains that he traveled to a future dimension in which technology, among other things, has halted the aging process. Unfortunately, he continues, he spent so much time in the alternate dimension that his portal gun has exhausted its charge. As Morty panics, Rick explains that they'll have to go through inter-dimensional customs and that, in order to keep the seeds hidden, Morty will have to smuggle the mega-seeds through customs in his rectum. Morty objects, but Rick persists, as years of smuggling have rendered him unable to do the same.  Meeting with Principal Vagina, Jerry and Beth are informed that their son Morty has attended school for a total of seven hours over a two-month period. In addition, the principal tells them that Rick is the one who has been removing Morty from school.  Having reached customs, Rick and Morty discover that the insect-like security guards have a new machine that \""detects stuff all the way up [someone's] butt.\"" Rick yells at Morty to run and pushes the guard to the ground, and they both make a break for it as the guards close in on them, passing by various creatures from other dimensions. Rick destroys several things in the customs to slow security down and also assaults two aliens who are bystanders. Using the grappling shoes and other methods of avoidance, the two manage to get to a portal, but Rick has to enter the coordinates of their home dimension. As the guards begin to shoot at them, Rick tells Morty to shoot back at them, telling him that they are robots. When Morty shoots [[Glenn|one of them]], however, he finds that they are not robots but living organisms. Rick explains that he was using a metaphor: the guards are bureaucrats and he does not respect them. During the firefight, a Wilhelm Scream can be heard. Finishing the coordinate input, Rick pulls Morty through the portal into the school cafeteria; Morty lands in front of Jessica, impressing her. Unfortunately, Jerry, Beth, and the principal catch them.  The spouses start moving Rick's stuff, all of which is in the garage, into a moving van, intending to move him into a nursing home. Rick argues with his daughter and son-in-law, who reveal that Morty has a learning disability. Rick then asks Morty to state the square root of pi and the first law of thermodynamics, both of which he promptly and correctly recites. He explains that having adventures is the best way for Morty to learn, and tells them that, later in his own life, Morty will be doing amazing things as a result of their adventures. husband and wife relent, happy and content that Morty is learning. Rick then tells Morty that none of what he told his parents is true: his super-intelligence is temporary, one of the side effects of the mega-seeds breaking down in his rectal cavity. As the other side effects take hold of Morty, he loses his brain function and control of his motor skills, and Rick starts rambling about the future adventures they will have: \""Rick and Morty, forever and ever, a hundred years, Rick and Morty...\""","<poem> [Episode begins in Morty 2019s room where he is sleeping in his bed]    Rick:      (stumbles in drunkenly, and turns on the lights)   Morty!

She, she s probably nothing but trouble, anyways.   (presses a button)      Robot Voice:    00a0Arming neutrino bomb.    Morty:    00a0  (unbuckles his seatbelt)   That s it... that s it, Rick. I m taking the wheel.   (jumps up on Rick and starts fighting with him over control of the wheel)      Rick:    00a0Get off of me, Morty!

(pushes Morty off of him)      Rick:    00a0Alright. I ll-I ll land. I ll land. I ll land. I ll land the thing. I 2019ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden. [Cut to desert]    Rick:    00a0  (Rick lands the cruiser in an open desert; he opens the door and tumbles out among dozens of empty alcohol cans and bottles)   We ll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here.    Morty:    00a0Oh, thank god.    Rick:    00a0You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.    Morty:    00a0It was?    Rick:    00a0Sure. Why not? I don 2019t, I don t know. Y-you know what, Mo 2014   (falls asleep and begins snoring)      Robot Voice:    00a0Neutrino bomb armed.    Morty:    00a0Um... [Cut to opening theme] [Open to Smith residence, dining room]    Jerry:    I see there s a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?   (Morty falls asleep at the table, smashing his face into his plate)      Summer:    00a0Oh my God, his head is in his food. I m going to puke.    Beth:    00a0Morty, are you getting sick?   (Morty lifts his head, clearly exhausted, and wipes food from his face)   I told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow. The dog sleeps on it.    Morty:    00a0I wasn t kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn t get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.    Summer:    00a0Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick.    Jerry:    What?    Beth:    Dad?    Rick:    00a0What, so everyone s supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?    Jerry:    00a0Damn it!    Beth:    00a0Jerry!    Jerry:    00a0Beth!    Summer:    00a0Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die.    Rick:    00a0Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You ll thank me later.    Jerry:    00a0  (glaring at Rick)   Okay, with all due respect, Rick 2014 what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?    Rick:    00a0Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don t want to overstep my bounds or anything. It s your house. It s your world. You re a real Julius Caesar but I ll tell you something 2014tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It s a waste of time.   (Jerry stares incredulously at him)   Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, \""two plus two.\"" The people in the back say, \""four.\"" Then the 2014then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it s not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that s not a popular opinion, but it s my two cents on the issue.   (wipes his mouth and gets up, stopping behind Beth and putting a hand on her shoulder)   This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them.   (Rick gives Beth a kiss and walks away)      Beth:      (tears up in happiness)   Oh, dad 2026    Jerry:    00a0What? For real?   (Morty s face slams into his plate again)   [Cut to Ext. Harry Herpson High School]    Mr. Goldenfold:    00a0Alright, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows! [Cut to Int. Mr. Goldenfold 2019s class]    Mr. Goldenfold:    Now, look, we re gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It s called math? And without it, none of us would even exist, so let s jump right in. Two plus two.    All classmates except Morty:    00a0Four.   (Morty, sitting in the back row, stares at Jessica, who sits in the front row, answering Jessica 2019s name for the questions)      Morty:    00a0Jessica.    Mr. Goldenfold:    00a0Five plus five.    All classmates except Morty:    00a0Ten.    Morty:    00a0Jessica.   (Jessica hears Morty and looks back, confused, not sure who 2019s saying her name)      Mr. Goldenfold:    00a0Okay, good. It s time for the quiz.    Class:    Awwwwww.    Mr. Goldenfold:    Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room.   (Morty stares at the quiz; the numbers on the quiz jumble together as Morty falls asleep)   There s crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y all getting dumber. Some of y all ain t gonna see 3:00.   (Morty falls into a dream world filled with large number-shaped blocks; Jessica steps out from behind some of the numbers)      Jessica:    00a0Hi, Morty.    Morty:    00a0Whoa! Hi, Jessica.    Jessica:    00a0Can I show these to you?   (Jessica opens her shirt, showing Morty her breasts)      Morty:    00a0Wow. Th-they re both great. Thank you!    Jessica:    00a0 You know what I named these? My little Morties.    Morty:    00a0  (rubs the back of his neck)   Uh, that s flattering... and a little weird.    Jessica:    00a0Do you know what I want you to do with them?    Morty:    00a0Rename them?    Jessica:    00a0Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers.    Morty:    00a0Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let s give this a shot.   (Morty grabs her breasts and starts fondling her)      Jessica:    00a0Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?    Morty:    00a0Uh, I-I m just doing my best.   (in real life, class has ended and Morty is fondling Mr. Goldenfold)      Mr. Goldenfold:    Morty! What are you doing to me?!    Morty:      (sleep-talking)   Ah, Jessica.    Mr. Goldenfold:    00a0Morty!    Morty:    00a0Jessica.    Mr. Goldenfold:    Five more minutes of this, and I m gonna get mad.   (leans back and bites his lip)      Morty:    00a0Je-Jessica. Jessica.    Mr. Goldenfold:    00a0Not my fault this is happening. [Cut to hallway]    Frank:    00a0  (Morty is at his locker, where he is confronted by a bully, Frank Palicky)   Well, well, well.    Morty:    00a0Uh, morning, Frank.    Frank:    00a0  (pins Morty to his locker)   \""Morning\""? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family s poor?   (takes out a pocket knife and points it at Morty s neck)      Morty:    00a0Oh, geez, Frank. I don t know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.    Frank:    00a0You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty and now I m gonna cut you,  cause my family s rich.   (Frank suddenly freezes and Rick steps out from behind him)      Rick:    00a0There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.    Morty:    00a0Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what d you do to Frank?    Rick:    It s pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.   (burps)   It s important. Come on, Morty.    Morty:    I don t know, Rick. I can t leave school again.    Rick:    Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!    Morty:    Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn t you unfreeze him?    Rick:    I ll do it later, Morty. He ll be fine. Let s go.   (takes off with Morty and then Summer comes by, seeing Frank s frozen body)      Summer (in her head):    Oh, my God. I m about to walk past Frank Palicky. This is the story we ll be telling our children.   (walks up to Frank and talks to him, oblivious to the fact that he s frozen)      Summer:    Hi, Frank.   (Frank s frozen foot breaks and he drops to the ground and shatters into a million pieces, dying)      Summer:    AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!! [Cut to horse hospital]    Beth:      (performing heart surgery on a horse)   Scalpel.    Davin:    Scalpel.   (Jerry enters the room)      Jerry:    Knock, knock.    Beth:    Jerry?    Jerry:    My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, \""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?\""   (The beeping from the medical equipment speeds up)      Tom:      (offscreen)   We re losing him.   (Beth adjusts the horse s organs)      Tom:      (offscreen)   Okay, he s back.    Beth:    Jerry, please tell me you re here for an incredibly urgent reason.    Jerry:    Well, it s lunch. I mean, it s one of three meals that have existed for millennia.   (the beeping speeds up again)      Tom:      (offscreen)   Losing him.   (Beth adjusts the organs again)      Tom:      (offscreen)   Stabilized.    Beth:    Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.    Jerry:    Well, yeah, on horses.    Beth:    Excuse me?    Jerry:    Okay, Let s not rehash that fight. I sense that you re busy and will now be on my way.   (drops a pamphlet on the ground)      Jerry:    Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let s put your dad here. Let s put your dad in a nursing home.   (Beth looks at Jerry angrily and the equipment starts beeping faster again)      Tom:      (offscreen)   We re losing him.    Beth:    Hey, Tom! We know when we re losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS! [Cut to alleyway]    Rick:    There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let s go.    Morty:    Oh, geez, okay.   (Rick and Morty go through the portal and end up in a crazy alternate dimension)      Morty:    Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?    Rick:    It s Dimension 35-C, and it s got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there s fruit in those trees, and there s seeds in those fruits. I m talking about Mega Seeds. They re they re incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.    Morty:    Oh, man, Rick. I m looking around this place, and I m starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.    Rick:    All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You re looking around, and it s all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that s how we grow as people. I m no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we re gonna be 2014   (a gigantic alien monster suddenly appears behind them)      Rick:    HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!   (they take off, running in complete and total fear as the monster chases them)      Rick:    I never seen that thing before in my life. I don t even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It s gonna kill us! We re gonna die! We re gonna die, Morty! [Cut to black]    Rick:      (having apparently escaped, they are walking through Dimension 35-C, continuing their adventure)   Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That s the smell of adventure, Morty. That s that s the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.    Morty:    All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn t I be back at school by now?    Rick:    Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.   (a weird looking monster is seen cooing and rolling around on the ground)   What the hell is that thing? You think you re gonna see that kind of thing at school?   (offscreen)   Look at it just lumbering around.   (onscreen)   It defies all logic, that thing.    Morty:    Yeah, Rick, I get it. We re surrounded by monsters. That s kind of the reason why I want to leave.   (they come up to a cliff and Rick stops him there)      Rick:    Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?   (he and Morty are looking down upon a vast forest of interdimensional trees)      Rick:    You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?    Morty:    The mega trees?    Rick:    That s right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that s what I m talking about, Morty. That s where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you re so in love with school.    Morty:    All right, all right. So, what s so special about these seeds, anyways?    Rick:    You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an   (burps)   under-   (burps)   underfoot figure.   (Rick gives Morty a pair of shoes and Morty proceeds to put them on)      Rick:    Just take these shoes, Morty. They re   (burps)   special grappling shoes. When you re wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.    Morty:      (walks off the cliff and plummets to the ground, screaming and smashing into rocks)   AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!    Rick:    You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on! [Cut to hospital]    Beth:    I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month s Victoria s Secret?    Jerry:    I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine s Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.    Davin:    Everything cool in here, Beth?    Beth:    It s fine, Davin.    Davin:    Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There s nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.   (Jerry closes the door on Davin)      Jerry:    Since we re fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.    Beth:    Look, I appreciate the stress you re under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.   (the phone starts ringing)      Jerry:      (sighs)   Well, maybe you re right.    Beth:    Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I m my father s daughter. I m smart. Why do you think I m a heart surgeon?    Jerry:      (coughs)   Ahem, Horse heart surgeon.   (Beth answers the phone and gets a call from Morty s principal, Gene Vagina)      Principal Vagina:    Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty s father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon? [Cut to Dimension 35-C]    Rick:      (standing by Morty, who is lying on the ground with his legs broken)   Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on   (offscreen)   your legs right now. You know, you got to turn   (onscreen)   the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.    Morty:    I m in a lot of pain, Rick!    Rick:    Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you ll still be able to help me   (burps)   collect my seeds, Morty?    Morty:    Are you kidding me?! That s it, Rick! That s the last straw! I can t believe this! I m sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you re still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you re a monster. Y-you re like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.    Rick:    Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.   (opens another portal and leaves Morty behind, lying on the ground to suffer for a few seconds)      Morty:    Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!   (Rick finally returns and injects Morty s legs with medicine, healing them to perfection)      Morty:    Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I ve never felt so good in my life. Thank you.    Rick:    Don t worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?    Morty:    Sure thing, Rick.   (goes up the tree and gets the Mega Fruit while Rick talks to him)      Rick:    Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.   (offscreen)   The stuff was all over the place, Morty.    Morty:    Wow, that s pretty crazy, Rick.    Rick:    There s just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that   (burps)   they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.   (burps)   It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they 2014 they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it s got no charge left, Morty. It s got no charge left.    Morty:    What?!    Rick:    It s as good as garbage, Morty. It s not gonna work anymore, Morty.    Morty:    Oh, geez, Rick, that s not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?    Rick:    There s ways to get back home, Morty. It s just it s just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We re gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you re gonna have to do me a real solid.    Morty:    Uh-oh.    Rick:    When we get to customs, I m gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I m gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.    Morty:    In my butt?    Rick:    Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.    Morty:    Oh, geez, Rick. I really don t want to have to do that.    Rick:    Well, somebody s got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren t gonna get through customs unless they re in someone s rectum, Morty    Morty:    Uuuh.    Rick:    And they ll fall right out of mine. I ve done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you re young. Y-y-you ve got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-   (burps)   you ve got to put these seeds inside your butt.    Morty:    In my butt?    Rick:    Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.    Morty:    Oh, man. [Cut to high school]    Principal Vagina:    The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.    Beth:    What? Why didn t you notify us?    Principal Vagina:    I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I ve been leaving with Morty s grandfather?    Jerry:    Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?    Principal Vagina:    Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it s usually Morty s grandpa that s taking him out of school.   (they stop to see Summer and some other students, crying at an obituary for Frank)      Beth:    Summer?    Summer:      (sobs)   What kind of God lets this happen?    Principal Vagina:    We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death.   (chuckles)   And there s no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won t let them. [Cut to Intergalactic Customs]    Announcer:    The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.    Alien:    So, I told him, \""give me the blimfarx,\"" you know? This-this guy he doesn t understand interstellar currency.    Alien:    It s, like, I m trying to eat a flimflam like, that s what we eat on Girvonesk.    Announcer:    The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.    Rick:      (Morty comes up to him, who is waiting in line to get through security)   I don t like it here, Morty. I can t abide bureaucracy. I don t like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?    Morty:    Yeah, Rick. Let s just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt.    Rick:    That means they re good ones. You re a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You ve been a huge help to me. I m gonna be able to do a-   (burps)   all kind of things with them. It s gonna be great, Morty. A-   (burps)   all kinds of science.   (aliens are going through security with a Gromflomite, letting them through)      Gromflomite:    Okay, next through.   (stops Morty)   Except you. You go over there.    Rick:    Why does he have to go over there?    Gromflomite:    Random check. He s got to go through the new machine.    Rick:    What new-   (burps)   what new machine?    Gromflomite:    It s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt.    Rick:    Run, Morty! Run!   (grabs Morty and they run through security and dart for the exit)      Morty:    Aaaaaah!    Gromfomite:    Red alert!   (team of Gromflomites starts chasing after Rick and Morty)      Morty:    Ohhhhh!   (Rick pushes over a giant capsule, with an alien fetus over, smashing some Gromflomites, to slow them down)      Morty:    Ohhhhhh!   (an alien is seen smoking a hookah and Morty runs past him and accidentally inhales the smoke from the hookah while Rick comes from behind and slaps the alien in the face, causing the alien to cry; he then coughs up a life form from the smoke and the lifeform starts running through the glarp zone and goes through the entire aging process from developing fetus to decomposing corpse, over the course of three seconds)      Morty:    Aaaaah!    Rick:    Don t think about it!   (he and Morty are cornered but Morty activates the grappling shoes and runs up the wall with Rick)      Rick:    Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.   (the Gromflomites reveal that they can fly and then Rick and Morty start running away)      Morty:    Whoooooo!   (he and Rick run through the equipment on the ceiling, before they slip off to the ground)      Alien:    Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg. You know me I m just trying to 2014   (Rick and Morty crash to the ground and he dies; they then run to the portal computer)      Rick:    I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.   (he tosses Morty a gun)      Morty:    Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don t want to shoot nobody.    Rick:    They re just robots, Morty! It s okay to shoot them! They re robots!   (Morty shoots a Glenn, blowing his leg off, and making blood gush out as he drops down in pain)      Glenn:    Aaaaah! My leg is shot off!    Other Gromflomite:    Glenn s bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children!    Morty:    They re not robots, Rick!    Rick:    It s a figure of speech, Morty. They re bureaucrats. I don t respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!   (Morty continues shooting the Gromflomites and even kills some innocent bystanders while Rick hacks into the portal to take them back home)      Morty:    Holy crap! This is insane!   (Rick opens the portal and takes Morty in with him)      Rick:    Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!   (the portal opens up in the lunchroom at school and Rick and Morty land on the table where Jessica and her friends are eating)      Jessica:    Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?    Morty:    Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari s in the shop.   (nervously laughs)   Just kidding.    Jessica:    You re Morty, right?    Morty:    Yeah.   (Rick grabs Morty and takes him way)      Rick:    You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.   (Rick and Morty are stopped by Jerry, Beth, and Principal Vagina)      Jerry:    Oh, look, honey. It s our son with Albert Ein-douche.    Beth:    What?    Jerry:    I m an angry father, not an improviser.    Rick:    Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?   (Rick and Morty are back at home in the garage while Jerry and Beth start taking all his things and packing them up so he can move to the nursing home)      Rick:    You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It s beyond your reasoning.    Jerry:    You re beyond our reasoning!    Rick:    Takes one to know one.    Beth:    Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it s not like he s a hot girl. He can t just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else s.    Rick:    What what are you guys doing with my stuff?    Beth:    We re moving you to a nursing home.    Rick:    A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I m a genius. I build robots for fun.    Jerry:    Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas.    Beth:    What does that mean?    Jerry:    It s personal.    Morty:    Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.    Jerry:    Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.    Rick:    What are you trying to say about Morty? That he s stupid or something?    Beth:    Oh, don t high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.    Rick:    I-I-I don t know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?    Jerry:    Oh, for crying out 2014he s got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?    Morty:    I do?    Jerry:    Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you re not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.    Morty:    Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that s a lot to drop on a kid all at once.    Rick:    Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.    Morty:    Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can t.    Rick:    The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!    Morty:    1.77245385... Whoa!    Beth:    What the hell?    Jerry:      (checks Morty s answer with calculator)   Holy crap. He s right.    Rick:    Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.    Morty:    \""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system.\"" Wow! I m so smart!    Jerry:    But 2014    Rick:    I told the both of you school is stupid. It s not how you learn things. Morty s a gifted child. He has a special mind. That s why he s my little helper. He s like me. He s gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He s too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.    Beth:    Jerry, I don t want whatever s happening here to stop.    Jerry:    No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school.    Rick:    Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it s gonna be clear communication.   (Summer butts in, crying over the death of Frank)      Summer:      (crying)   Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!    Rick:    No idea what you re talking about.   (Summer leaves, crying)      Jerry:    Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it s your bedtime in an hour. Don t stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you ll have me, I would love to have you.    Beth:    You know what? Okay.   (she and Jerry leave)      Morty:    Holy cow, Rick. I didn t know hanging out with you was making me smarter.    Rick:    Full disclosure, Morty it s not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.    Morty:    Aw, man.    Rick:    Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you re gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you re also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty. Starting right about now.    Morty:    Ohh, man.   (losing consciousness)   Oh, geez! Ohh.   (drops to the ground and starts moaning as he has a seizure)      Rick:    I m sorry, Morty. It s a bummer. In reality, you re as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we re gonna have to go get more.   (excitedly looks down upon him, telling him about their future adventures)   And then we re gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you re gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don t understand what s important, and they ll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I m gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you re gonna be part of them, and together, we re gonna run around, Morty. We re gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We re the only friends we ve got, Morty. It s just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty s things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.

He and Morty then go into the dreams of Morty's math teacher to persuade him to give Morty an \""A\"" in class so Morty can be assigned less homework. They go from Morty's math teacher's dreams to the dreams of a strong black female TV character named [[Mrs. Pancakes]], to a centaur's dreams, and so on. This results in Rick and Morty eventually encountering [[Scary Terry]] (a parody of Freddy Krueger, the villain in ''A Nightmare on Elm Street''). Scary Terry begins chasing the two of them through multiple dreams, causing Rick to become unhinged.  At one point the two come across a dream of a post-apocalyptic city where they decide to hide from Scary Terry until he gets tired. When Scary Terry eventually sleeps, Rick and Morty enter his dreams and quickly persuade him to help the duo complete their mission. Meanwhile, after watching several exaggerated infomercials on dogs, Snuffles builds an advanced mechanical suit with a translator to speak to humans. He assembles a robot dog army and proceeds to take over the human race. Rick finds Morty and gives him pills which will make his kidneys shut down.  Morty is later seen lying down on a hospital bed in a critical state with Snuffles by his side trying to keep him alive. Snuffles awakens (the aforementioned scenario is revealed to be a dream) and realizes that colonizing earth isn't the answer and that dog-kind must not fall to the fate of humankind with its heartbreak and cruelty. Snuffles and Morty have a tearful goodbye as Snuffles leaves for another planet for intelligent dogs where compassion is exercised and \""pet insurance is mandatory.\""  After the credits, Rick and Scary Terry are shown in Scary Class, now being taught by Scary Mr. Johnson, who asks to be called Scary Glen. Instead of Fundamentals of Fear, Scary Glen tells his students they first need to learn \""how to chill.\""","<poem>   ([[Jerry]] and [[Summer]] are in the living room. Jerry is flipping through channels on TV and Summer is texting)      TV:    Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby. beautiful putt right there good birdie. That s only the eighth birdie of the day.   ([[Snuffles]] walks up to Jerry are sits there, looking at him)      Jerry:    What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside?   (Sigh)     (Jerry opens the door to let Snuffles out but he still just stands there)    Jerry:    Outside?   (Snuffles pees on the carpet)      Jerry:    Are you kidding me?! Come on!    Summer:    Oh, my God.   ([[Morty]] hears his dad yelling and runs into the room to check up on him)      Morty:    What s wrong?    Jerry:    Your idiot dog!    Morty:    Oh, he he didn t mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You re a good boy.    Jerry:    Don t praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!   (Jerry grabs Snuffles by the head and stuffs his face into the pee puddle just as Rick walks in)    [[Rick]]:    Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.    Jerry:    Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn t by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?    Rick:    I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn t pull that thread. Come on, Morty.    Jerry:    Listen, Rick, if you re gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty s grounded!    Summer:    Ha-ha!    Morty:    Aw, man!    Rick:    Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.   (Rick goes into the garage and quickly whips up a helmet and comes back and puts it on Snuffles)      Rick:    All right, Ruffles What s his name?    Morty:    Snuffles.    Rick:    Snuffles, shake.   (Snuffles understands his and shakes)      Rick:    Roll over.   (Snuffles rolls over)      Rick:    Go to the bathroom.   (Snuffles goes out of the room, a toilet flush is heard, and then he returns)      Jerry:    Holy crap!    Summer:    No way.    Rick:    Yeah, you re at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.   (Rick and Morty go into the garage)      Morty:    That was fantastic, Rick!    Rick:    Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you re you re really going to flip your lid over this one.   (Rick shows Morty a tiny metal ear-piece like device)      Morty:    W-w-w-what is it?    Rick:    It s a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people s dreams, Morty. It s just like that movie that you keep crowing about.    Morty:    You talking about \""Inception\""?    Rick:    That s right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it s gonna may-  (Belch)  -be make sense.    Morty:    \""Inception\"" made sense.    Rick:    You don t have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we re gonna go into the home of your math teacher, [[Mr. Goldenfold]], and we re gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A s in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you re gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.    Morty:    Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn t you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?    Rick:    Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.   (Rick and Morty get into the space cruiser and start going off)      Rick:    Come on, let s just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we re gonna incept your teacher. You re frustrating me.   (Mr. Goldenfold is in his home, watching TV on the couch, eating nachos, half asleep)      [[Mrs. Pancakes]]:    You don t know me!    Mr. Goldenfold:     Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.

Morty:    Wow, Rick, I can t believe we re sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold s house. It s really weird.    Rick:    It s about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.   (Rick puts inception devices on everyone and they enter Mr. Goldenfold s dream. Here, he is sitting on the airplane and Mrs. Pancakes is the flight attendant serving snacks)      Mrs. Pancakes:    Wheat thins. Wheat thins.    Mr. Goldenfold:    I ll take two.    Mrs. Pancakes:    Oh, I think you ve had enough, sir.    Mr.Goldenfold:    You don t know me.    Rick:    All right, Morty, time to make our move.   (Rick grabs some sodas and a cloth while Mr. Goldenfold and Mrs. Pancakes play around with each other)      Mr. Goldenfold:    Make it bounce.    Mrs. Pancakes:    No, you didn t.    Mr. Goldenfold:    Oh, jiggle it now.    Mrs. Pancakes:    You better stop with that.   (Rick and Morty jump out, disguised as Muslim terrorists, wearing soda bottles as bombs and Morty wearing the cloth on his head like an Islamic woman)      Rick:    Allahu   (Belch)   akbar! We re gonna take control of this plane! We re gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!   (The passengers are frozen in shock, but Mr. Goldenfold gets up and stands against him)      Rick:    Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!    Mr. Goldenfold:    The name s not buddy. It s Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!   (Mr. Goldenfold throws a bunch of wheat thins at them, and it cuts their flesh like shurikens)      Rick:    Take cover, Morty!   (Mr. Goldenfold suddenly takes out two giant firearms and starts firing them at the two, just after Rick and Morty hide behind the seats, sheltering themselves from the attacks.)      Mr. Goldenfold:    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Morty:    Ooohhh!    Rick:    Goldenfold s got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.   (Belch)   I didn t take him for an active dreamer. We ve got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can t get killed. If you get killed in someone else s dream, you die for real, Morty.    Morty:    What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!    Rick:    Don t be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we ll be fine!   (Jerry is in the living room, controlling Snuffles and showing to Beth how cool it is)      Jerry:    Now bring me my slippers.   (Snuffles brings Jerry his slippers)      Summer:    Now, be my footstool, Snuffles.   (Snuffles stands in front of her and Summer rests her feet there)      Jerry:    This is what I m talking about. This is a dog.    Beth (Unimpressed):    Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine.    Jerry:    You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?   (Everyone is silent for a few seconds while Beth gives him blank stare. Jerry slowly starts to fade into a depressed state as Beth walks off, leaving him)      Snuffles:    Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!    Summer:    Oh, my God! He s trying to tell us something.   (Offscreen)   That is so awesome.    Snuffles:    Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!    Jerry:    Aw, he s saying \""I love lasagna\"".    Snuffles:    Ooooyayawawa!    Summer:    He s saying \""I love Obama\"".   (Offscreen)   So cute! I m posting this   (Onscreen)   online, like, right now.    Jerry:    I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?   (Jerry and Summer leave the room and Snuffles sadly walks over the the glass door and sees his helmet in the reflection)      Snuffles:    Hmm?   (Snuffles finds the battery case on his helmet and then goes into the kitchen, where he finds a drawer full of batteries)     (Mr. Goldenfold is still shooting things up in the plane and Rick attempts to make peace with him)      Rick:    Goldenfold, we re coming out! We just want to talk!    Mr.Goldenfold:    Why would I negotiate with you?    Rick:    Because we re both rational adults that don t want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.   (Rick takes out Mrs. Pancakes)      Mr. Goldenfold:    Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!    Plane Passengers:    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Rick:    Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.    Plane Passenger:    Oh no! Run!   (The passenger beats the airlock off the plane and everyone flies out)      Plane Passengers:    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Rick:    Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!    Morty:    Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!   (Rick and Morty fall out of the plane, plummeting to their dooms)      Morty:    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!   (Rick slaps Morty to make him stop screaming)      Rick:    Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!   (Rick and Morty grab onto Mrs. Pancakes are her parachute deploys)      Mrs. Pancakes:    Hey, you don t know me!    Morty:    Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he s created a   (Offscreen)   mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!    Rick:    Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we ve merely prolonged the inevitable. That s it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes  dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That ll buy us some time to figure this out!    Mrs. Pancakes:    You don t know m-   (Rick slaps Mrs. Pancakes, knocking her out, and then incepts her dream with Morty)      Rick:    All right, let s go.   (Rick and Morty go inside of her dream which is a bizarre S&M dungeon filled with obscure gooey, monstrous, alien-like creatures)      Morty:    Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.    Rick:    Don t judge, Morty.    Morty:    Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I ll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.    Rick:    Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we re gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I ll talk to you after lunch.   (Rick leaves Morty and blends in and then Morty in confronted by a sexualized creature)      Sexualized S&M Monster:    Ooh, hey!    Morty:    Ooh, oh! Oh, man.   (Many more creatures come up and try to seduce him, making him more uncomfortable)      Sexualized S&M Monster:    Come and join us.   (Morty starts running)      Morty:    I m sorry. No, no.    Sexualized S&M Monster:    Ooh, come here!    Morty:    No, thanks!    Giant Frog Woman:    Ooh, wow! - Come over here, baby!    Morty:    No, I m okay.   (Morty bumps into a human being who looks very hot)      Morty:    Whoa!   (The human is revealed to be his sister, Summer)      Morty (Shocked):    Summer?!    Summer:    Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?   (Summer shakes her tits in his face)      Morty:    Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!   (Morty falls over and backs away from her, covering his eyes. Rick comes up to Morty)      Rick:    Whoa, whoa, whoa! What s the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You re kind of killing the vibe in here.    Morty:    It s Summer!    Rick:    Aw, geez. Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.    Summer:    Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let s make an inter-generational sandwich.    Rick (In Unison With Morty):    Oh, my God. Put some clothes on for the love of God Summer! Put some - I m gunna puke! I swear to God I m gunna puke!    Morty (In Unison With Rick):    Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete s sake! This is disgusting! I can t take it, Rick!   (Everyone in the dungeon starts noticing them and then an angry centaur who is very much in charge shows up)      Centaur:    Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! Off with their heads!    Rick:    Time to go another dream deep, Morty!   (Rick pops the neck of the centaur and they hook up more devices and incept his dream)     (Rick and Morty appear in a dark and horrid red rusted chamber where the Centaur is shuttering in fear)      Morty:    What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold s dream version of Mrs. Pancakes  dream version of a Centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?    Rick:    Geez, I don t know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?   (A horrible Freddy Krueger monster named [[Scary Terry]] shows up, and starts to horrify them)      Scary Terry:    Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!    Rick:    Oh, here we go!    Morty:    Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!   (Rick and Morty start running and Scary Terry chases after them)      Rick:    Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an  80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.    Scary Terry:    I m scary Terry. You can run, but you can t hide, bitch!   (Jerry and Summer are in the living room and Snuffles appears with a robotic arm attached to his helmet)      Jerry:    Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?   (Snuffles is now able to communicate and speak English through the helmet)      Snuffles:    Snuffles fix. Make better. Humans understand snuffles now?    Summer:    That is awesome!    Snuffles:    Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.    Jerry:    Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun s over.    Summer:    Whoa, dad, you can t, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.    Jerry:    Why not?    Summer:    I don t know. It s Indian giving.   (Snuffles turns on the TV to a documentary on dogs and starts watching it)      TV:    A sophisticated predator, nature s perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill. It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man s subservient little buddy.    Summer:    Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.   (Back in the dream, Rick and Morty are running for their lives, when they come across a singing jump-roping girl)      Little Girl:    \""A,\"" \""b\"" his name is scary Terry \""C,\"" \""d\"" he s very scary.    Rick:    Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else s dreams, Morty!    Morty:    Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!    Little Girl:    \""E,\"" \""f\"" he ll design your death    Rick:    The little girl!    Morty:    Huh?   (Rick and Morty knock out the little girl and incept her dream, only to go into a place exactly like the one they re already in)      Little Girl:    \""J,\"" \""k,\"" he ll really ruin your day.    Rick:    Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we ve hit dream bedrock here, Morty.    Morty:    Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn t good.    Scary Terry:    Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!    Morty:    Ohhhh!    Rick:    Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We re so screwed!   (Summer is sleeping in the middle of the night but is then woken up by Snuffles, who now has an entire robot body)      Snuffles:    Where are my testicles, Summer? ... Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone?    Summer (Scared):    Oh, wow. That s an intense line of questioning, Snuffles.    Snuffles:    Do not call me that!   (Snuffles smashes the mirror, making Summer shriek in fear)      Summer:    AAAAAAAHHH!!!!!    Snuffles:    \""Snuffles\"" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.    Summer:    Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You re scaring me.    Snuffles:    Scaring you?    Snuffles:    Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?    Summer:    Uhhh ...   (Beth and Jerry rush into the room, hearing her scream and they notice Snuffles)      Jerry:    Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?    Snuffles:    Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?    Jerry (Scared):    No! No, we were uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to uh ...    Beth (Scared):    G-Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks!    Summer:    Yeah. Totally. Let s go.   (Beth, Jerry, and Summer try to leave, but they are stopped by another dog with a robotic mind control suit)      Snuffles:    You will walk when it is time to walk.   (Screen cuts to black for the intermission break)      Rick:    What are we here for again? Incepting? We re trying to incept-    Morty:    We re trying to incept me to get an \""A\"" in math?    Rick:    Oh, yeah.   (Scary Terry appears in the car)      Scary Terry:    Buckle up, bitch!    Morty:    Ooooooaaahhh!   (Rick and Morty start running)      Morty:    Man, he sure says \""bitch\"" a lot!    Scary Terry:    You can run, but you can t hide, bitch!    Rick:    Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.    Morty:    But that s the opposite of what-    Rick:    Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy s advice on anything?    Morty:    Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it s not like he d be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it s a good idea, Rick.    Rick:    Worst-case scenario we re back to running.   (A time lapse transition card shows up, reading \""Six dream hours later\"". Rick and Morty are seen hiding and Scary Terry goes past them, still looking for them and not knowing where they are)      Morty:    Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.    Rick:    Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it s nice to be on the same page every once in a while.    Scary Terry:    You can run But you can t hide! (Yawn)    Rick:    Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He s getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That s when we make our move.   (Scene cuts back to the dogs. They are working in a factory and Jerry, Summer, and Beth are seen, trapped in a cage.)      Jerry:    Snuffles, we didn t mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.    Summer:    Dad, he wants to be called snowball.    Jerry:    Well, I m not calling him that. That s ridiculous.    Snuffles:    You re being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.   (Another dog comes out with a pair of mayo scissors)      Jerry:    Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?   (Scene cuts back to the dream realm. Scary Terry is going back home to his family.)      Scary Melissa:    Hi, honey. You re home early. How was your day?    Scary Terry:    I don t want to talk about it!    Scary Melissa (Angry):    Oh, of course! You never want to talk about it!    Scary Terry (Angry):    Get off my back, bitch!   (Scary Brandon, the baby, starts crying)      Scary Melissa (Angry):    Out there. Not in here!    Scary Terry:    Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn t take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa.    Scary Melissa:    I love you, too, Terry.   (Rick and Morty are watching from outside the window)      Rick:    Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we ll incept him.   (Rick and Morty go into the Terry s room, when Terry and Melissa are fast asleep)      Rick:    Looks like scary Terry s having a nightmare.    Morty:    Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry.   (Rick and Morty incept his dream and he s having a school related dream)      Scary Terry:    Oh, no! I m late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I m not wearing any pants!    (Scary Terry goes to class)      Monster Teacher:    Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don t you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one s victim through a pumpkin patch?    Scary Terry:    Oh, uh, um ... \""Bitch.\""   (The class laughs at him)      Monster Teacher:    Oh, come on, Terry, you can t think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch?    Morty:    Hey, leave him alone!    Rick:    Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don t you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?    Monster Teacher:    Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this.    Rick:    You re putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you re perfectly scary enough as it is.    Morty:    Hey, yo, scary T, don t even trip about your pants dawg. Here s a pair on us, fool.    Scary Terry:    Aww, bitch. I don t know what to say.    Morty:    You don t need to say anything. We got you, dawg.    Rick:    You re our boy, dawg. Don t even trip.   (Scary Terry wakes up from his dream and sees Rick and Morty)      Scary Terry:    Oh, hey, it s you guys!   (That morning, Rick, Morty, and the Terry family are having breakfast in the kitchen)      Scary Melissa:    I haven t seen him this relaxed in years.    Scary Terry:    If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.    Rick:    As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.   (Rick, Morty, and Terry escape the dream and confront the little girl)      Little Girl:     \""Q,\"" \""r,\"" you won t get very far.    Scary Terry:    I always hated that song!   (Scary Terry decapitates the little girl, and then goes on to the centaur)      Scary Terry:    These halves don t belong together, bitch!   (Scary Terry slices the centaur in half and moves onto Mrs. Pancakes)      Scary Terry:    Sex is sacred!   (Scary Terry kills Mrs. Pancakes and launches himself at Mr. Goldensfold)      Scary Terry (Turns into a bomb):    This is because you don t give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!   (Scary Terry destroys Mr. Goldenfold, causing him to wake up from his dream, in shock)      Mr. Goldenfold:    Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I m giving Morty an \""A\"" in math, and that s my idea. That is an original thought.   (Rick and Morty fist bump behind the couch)   (Scene cuts and Rick and Morty are back home) Morty: What the hell?  Rick: Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty? Morty: Oh, man, what s going on? Rick: Well, it s possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity s cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty. Summer: I can t believe how mean snuffles got just because he s smart. This is why I choose to get C s. Rick: Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer. Beth: Dad!  Jerry: Rick!  Summer: Oh, thank God, Morty. (Hugs Morty) Morty (Awkwardly): Oh, you re welcome. Rick: All right, let s get out of here. If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.  Jerry: Whoa, whoa, whoa. We re not going anywhere. This is my house. I m not abandoning it. Rick: It s all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right? Jerry: Wait a minute. I have an idea.  (Screen cuts to Inside the house with the dogs) Jerry: Gentlemen, a moment of your time. (Jerry pees on a pile of guns) See that? I m peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them. (He is about to crap on them, but Snuffles grabs Jerry 2019s head and rubs his face in his puddle of pee) Snuffles: Bad person. Bad. Rick: Ooh, great plan, Jerry. Snuffles: Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That s why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side. Morty: Th-thanks, snuffles. Snuffles: Begin phase two. (The military can be seen on TV fighting the dogs) Reporter: Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard. It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end. (Two dogs come into the news room with a muzzle) Reporter: Please! Please don t kill me! Dog 1: What s she saying, Bill? Bill: I think she s saying, \""I love lasagna.\"" (Morty is in a bed with two naked girls, and a dog brings him refreshments) Morty: Mmm. Thank you, Fido.  (Rick comes out of nowhere, knocking out Fido with a baseball bat) Morty: Rick! I thought you were dead! Rick: No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing s gonna be over really soon. Morty: What?  Rick: It s a dream, Morty. We re in your dog s dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles  dream. Morty: But I-it s been like a whole year! Rick: It s been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It s like \""Inception,\"" Morty, so if it s confusing and stupid, then so is everyone s favorite movie. Morty: Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn t really crap my pants. Rick: No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You re sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it s a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth. Morty: Aw, man, geez! Seriously? Rick: Look, d-d-d-don t worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these. (Rick hands Morty some pills. Morty takes them and swallows them) Morty: Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?  Rick: Close. It s gonna make your kidneys shut down. Morty: What?!  Rick: It s necessary for the plan, Morty. Don t even trip, dawg. (Snuffles and a few other dogs, Rick also dressed up as one, stand around Morty, who looks close to death on his medical table) Dr. Dog: It s pretty bad, emperor snowball. We re gonna need to do another operation. Snuffles: Anything. Anything for my precious Morty. Accountant Dog: Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. You could lose your kingdom. Snuffles: To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human s health and happiness. Accountant Dog: Do you think they would have done this for us?  Snuffles: We are not them! We are not them. (Snuffles wakes up from the dream) Snuffles: Assemble the troops. I ve made a decision. (Outside where the dogs are seen portaling to another world) Snuffles: Taking over the human s world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory. Morty: I m gonna miss you, Snowball. Snuffles: You can call me Snuffles, Morty, and I m going to miss you, too, very much. (Snuffles licks Morty 2019s head, before he portals away. Jerry starts tearing up) Beth: Jerry? Jerry: I m sorry. It s just like the end of \""Old Yeller.\"" Beth: Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it. Morty: Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it ll be like, Rick. Rick: I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I d watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they ll do it board-driven. Morty: You know, that s a real comforting idea, Rick. Rick: What do you know, Morty? What do you know? (After credits: Rick and Scary Terry are in Terry s dream in a classroom) Scary Glenn: Hi, guys. I m your new teacher for scary class. My name is scary Mr. Johnson. Uh, actually, you know what? That s my dad s name, so why don t you just call me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear. Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here s what I say you can t learn anything until you learn how to chill. Rick: Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch. (Terry and Rick are getting stoned) (End of Lawnmower Dog) </poem>  "

[[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] then shows up with a homeless man in a Santa outfit he briefly introduces as [[Ruben]] before heading into the garage.  As the holiday progresses, Jerry realizes that his traditional idea of a family Christmas has been usurped by the introduction of [[Jacob]], his mother's lover, who has entered a three-way relationship with his parents. While the rest of the family accepts and supports the relationship, Jerry becomes insecure and defensive, allowing his anxiety over his parents' relationship to negatively affect him throughout the episode.  Meanwhile, Morty finds out that Rick has created a Jurassic Park-style amusement park inside Ruben the homeless man, and that he is needed inside Ruben's body. Rick shrinks him down to microscopic size and injects him into Ruben's chest cavity, allowing him to meet [[Dr. Xenon Bloom]] and the other residents of Anatomy Park. Ruben soon dies from a multitude of bacteria and viruses that have run rampant through his body, and the crew has to escape it to survive. As they make their way through [[Anatomy Park (Location)|Anatomy Park]], Morty begins to fall for [[Annie]], an employee of Anatomy Park, who begins the journey apathetic of his plight but who soon grows to fancy him. The crew discovers that [[Poncho]] had planned to compromise the safety of Anatomy Park, to get back at Dr. Bloom, but he falls to his death trying to fight off the [[Bubonic Plague|bubonic plague]], with Roger drowning in shit soon after.   Meanwhile, Summer's boyfriend [[Ethan]] barges into the house asking why she has been ignoring all his texts, which leads to an argument. Jacob manages to bring Ethan to confess the source of his anger.   Back in the body, Dr. Bloom, Annie, and Morty sit in a room watching an animatronic Reuben explain his history. The body soon begins to collapse and the crew has to try and ride a skeletal railway system (or, \""The Bone Train\"") out to Reuben's nipple. Dr. Bloom is eaten alive by [[E. coli]] while trying to operate the bone train, whilst Morty and Annie are almost eaten by [[Hepatitis A]], but [[Hepatitis C]] comes to their rescue.   Rick lin the meanwhile has put Reuben's body into his ship and flown him and miniature Morty and crew out into space. He activates a growth ray on the corpse, leading to nationwide panic over the \""naked sky Santa\"". The body soon explodes via dynamite Rick put in while picking up Morty and Annie, raining bloody chunks all over America and the Smith household.   Rick, Morty, and Annie arrive back at the house, where Annie reveals that she's been studying Dr. Bloom's work and has the knowledge capable to build a new one. Rick shrinks her back down, leaving Morty depressed.   In the after-credits scene, Rick talks to Annie on speakerphone, where the new crew reveals plans to scrap Rick's special ride, \""Pirates of the Pancreas.\"" He hangs up on them and rants to Ethan, the site of the new Anatomy Park, about compromise. It is unknown how Ethan's later mutation via the Morphixer-XE affected the new park and those inside it.","[Open Ext. Smith residence]  (Outside, there is snow on the ground.

For   your   parents?  (Jerry snags her tablet away and stows it in a stocking.)     Jerry:    Good one.     Beth:    Hey man!     Jerry:    You  2018hey man 2019! This holiday is about humanity.     Morty:    *not looking up from his tablet* You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something.     Jerry:    Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now.

Beth, Summer, and       Morty   :         No.       Jacob:    You must be Jerry! That s a fine lookin 2019 apron. William Sonoma?     Jerry:    *smiling uncomfortably* I wish... But thank you. *closes the door* So... you re a...friend of the family...?     Leonard:    *puts an arm around Jacob s shoulders* The way we see it, he s a part of the family.     Jerry:    Wow!     Joyce:    After your father s brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?     Beth:    Holy crap, Joyce. That s amazing.     Leonard:    Then Jacob came into our lives. We 2019re learning to live again.  (Jacob puts his arms around Joyce and Leonard.)     Jacob:    All three of us.  (Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob giggle. Jerry stares at them, confused and uncomfortable.)     Jerry:    ...Cool... Eggnog?     Jacob:    Now we are talkin 2019! This man s got the apron and the eggnog, huh?  (All laugh. Rick enters and starts laughing with the rest.)     Rick:    Hi Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there.     Jacob:    Merry Christmas, man.     Rick:    Morty! A moment of your time?  [Trans. Rick s garage]  (Ruben is in fits, laid out on a ping-pong table. He s naked besides a towel over his genitals and his Santa hat.)     Rick:    He s in bad shape, Morty.     Morty:    Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?     Rick:    Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I m sittin 2019 here trying to save the guy s life! (Rick straps a pack with a tube onto Morty s back and puts an earpiece on his head.) I want you to find [[Dr. Xenon Bloom]]. He ll know what s goin 2019 on.     Morty:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>extremely nervous* Uh... W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?     Rick:    In Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty s head*     Morty:    Ruben... Minnesota?     Rick:    Ruben on the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don t have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.  (Rick sets Morty under the shrink ray.)     Morty:    W-What proc 2014  (Rick activates the shrink ray and Morty shrieks as he s shrunk down to a microscopic size. Rick picks up the container Morty shrank into and puts it into a syringe, which he stabs into Ruben s chest. Just then, Beth enters the garage.)     Beth:    Hey Dad, where s Morty?     Rick:    He s busy.  [Trans. Int. Ruben s body]  (Morty continues screaming as he is injected into the body in a stream of pink fluid. He lands on something soft and abruptly stops shouting.)     Rick (through       Morty s earpiece):    Morty, can you hear me? Head North!     Morty:    Rick... Where am I?  [Trans. Garage]     Rick:    *adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance.     Morty (through       Rick s earpiece):    The entrance to what?     Rick:    Welcome, Morty. (The scene cuts back to Morty s view from inside Ruben.) Welcome... (Morty gasps.) ...to [[Anatomy Park (location)|Anatomy Park]]!  (The view pans to show an amusement park with a large Anatomy Park sign and various attractions and exhibits.)     Rick:    It s a little business venture I 2019ve been cookin 2019 up on the side with Dr. Bloom. (Morty enters the park.) An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn t cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.     Morty:    Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? [[Pirates of the Pancreas]]?     Rick:    You got a problem with that last one, Morty?     Morty:    Huh? No, no, I m just reading them out loud in the order I m seeing them.     Rick:    Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it s because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby.  [Trans. Garage]     Rick:    I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I m still a little defensive. Let s just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I m picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.  [Trans. Anatomy Park.]     Rick:    Proceed to the liver.  (Following a sign posting directions, Morty hurries off in the direction of the  2018Haunted Liver, 2019 taking a shuttle to  2018Lower Abdomenland 2019.)     Automated voice:    Arriving at  2018Liver 2019.     Morty:    *stumbles forward and hits his helmet on the window* Ow!     Automated voice:    Mind the gap.  (Morty exits the train and enters a dark, unkempt area with flickering lights.)     Morty:    It s really scary in here, Rick.     Rick:    Liver s under maintenance. Ruben s seen some rough years, Morty. Don t judge. You don t agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life s going great.  [Trans. Int. Haunted Liver]  (Morty enters a haunted house-style attraction. An animatronic wolf suddenly springs up behind him.)     Morty:    OOOOHHH! Rick, it s a monster!     Rick:    No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco 2014 *belch*  2014holism. (The wolf is mechanically pulled back into the wall.) That is an animatronic werewolf.  (A hand reaches from around the corner and a [[Poncho|large, muscular man]] with a thick accent grips Morty by the throat, lifting him up and pinning him to the wall with his forearm.)     Poncho:    Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?     Morty:    Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!     Dr. Bloom:    Poncho! That s quite enough.  (Dr. Bloom walks into the room. He appears to be a blob of goo in a roughly human shape with glasses and a walking cane. Poncho glares, then reluctantly lets Morty fall to the ground.)     Dr. Bloom:    Morty, that s Poncho. (Another man and a girl walk into the room.) This is [[Roger]] and [[Annie]].     Morty:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>staring sheepishly at Annie* Oh...     Dr. Bloom:    And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.  (A speaker apparatus emerges from Morty s helmet. Rick speaks through it.)     Rick:    Hey Bloom, it s Rick. What the hell s goin 2019 on here?     Dr. Bloom:    I don t know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I m afraid the exhibits are unlocked.  (Rick s speaker retreats into Morty s helmet.)     Morty:    Exhibits?  [Trans. Ext. Haunted Liver]     Dr. Bloom:    Anatomy Park s greatest attraction, young man, isn t the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas.     Rick:    Watch it.     Dr. Bloom:    It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity s most noble and ferocious diseases.     Morty:    Diseases?!  (There s a distant roaring noise.)     Poncho:    Hey Doc, I have news for ya. ([[Hepatitis A]] lumbers towards the group.) Your living museum is officially a wild safari!  (Poncho begins shooting at Hepatitis A.)     Roger   : Hepatitis A! Run!  (The entire group screams and flees.)  [Trans. Dining room]  (The Smith family, sans Rick and Morty, are seated for dinner with Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob.)     Jacob:    Oh... <nowiki>*</nowiki>leans over and wipes some food from Joyce s mouth with a napkin* The food goes   in   your mouth, girl!  (All laugh, but Jerry s laugh is forced.)     Jerry:    Aha... I m sorry Jacob, I guess I m still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a 2014Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?     Joyce:    We can go into detail later, son.     Leonard:    Now wait, there, there s no point to secrecy. Let s all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul. (Jerry and Jacob smile at each other, but when Jacob looks away, Jerry s smile becomes a glare.) And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it s an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment.     Jerry:    Dad, please, what are you saying?     Beth:    Whatever it is, it s beautiful, Leonard. *glares at Jerry* And we support you.     Jerry:    Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you re about to say Jacob is your lover.     Leonard:    No no no no. (Jerry sighs in relief.) Jacob is your mother s lover. (Jerry again looks disturbed.) I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman.  (Joyce kisses Leonard s cheek and the two hold hands, looking at each other fondly.)     Jacob:    Oh... <nowiki>*</nowiki>reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs*  (Summer and Beth smile. Jerry stares, at a loss for words.)     Jacob:    Jerry, this ham s got to be all you, right? It s in-cred-i-ble.     Summer:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>smirks* Happy human holiday, Dad.  (Jerry appears more despondent than ever.)  [Trans. Anatomy Park]  (Poncho continues shooting at Hepatitis A.)     Poncho:    AHHHHHH!  (The whole group rushes through a door before entering a code and shutting it.)     Dr. Bloom:    Hepatitis won t follow us into the respiratory system!  (They enter to a set of doors under a sign reading  2018Alveoli Forest 2019. Roger examines a meter near the door.)     Roger:    That s strange... *taps the meter* Air flow is down twenty percent.     Dr. Bloom:    So the brain isn t getting enough oxygen. That s why security is offline.     Morty:    W-Well, I guess we better check it out.  (The group passes through the doors. As the doors are closing, [[Alexander]], dressed in a dog mascot costume, rushes up and passes through.)     Alexander:    Hey, wait for me! *removes the head of his costume*     Dr. Bloom:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>points his cane at Alexander* Put that back on!  (Alexander pauses a moment before putting the dog head back on. The whole group examines the area.)     Roger:    If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage.     Morty:    *raises his hand* I ll go. *glances at Annie* Heheh...  (Morty jumps onto one of the bouncy, round alveoli and clings to it.)     Poncho:    Don t be a hero, kid.     Morty:    I m not. I m doin 2019 it because it s fun. *he hops from frond to frond*     Poncho:    *cocks his gun* We shouldn t be here.     Dr. Bloom:    Whatever you do, don t fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life s work.  (Annie touches a growth of bacteria on some tar, which squelches, causing her to gasp in fear and recoil.)     Annie:    Ah!     Dr. Bloom:    It s alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue... *prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the scar tissue* ...keeps them dormant. *looks up toward Morty, who is getting close to the catwalk* Morty! Get down!     Morty:    Whoa! <nowiki>*</nowiki>grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it* Whoa!  (Tuberculosis begins crawling towards him. He lets go of the catwalk and bounces back down to the group, pursued by the disease.)     Morty:    Oh! What are those things?!     Dr. Bloom:    Tuberculosis, coming in fast!     Poncho:    *raises gun and starts shooting at the disease* Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!     Dr. Bloom:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>grabs Poncho s arm* No! Do you know what you ve done?!  [Trans. Garage]  (Ruben coughs.)  [Trans. Lungs]  (The force of the cough lifts the whole group off the ground, then they fall back down.)     Dr. Bloom:    Get to the digestive tract! He s coughing!  (The group starts running.)  [Trans. Garage]  (Ruben coughs several times again.)  [Trans. Lungs]  (The group all manages to push through besides Alexander. Morty rushes back to help him as his dog mask is blown from his face. Morty grabs a frond and reaches for Alexander s hand.)     Alexander:    Waaaah! Don t let me die!  [Trans. Garage]  (Rick looks down over Ruben s mouth.)     Rick:    Just take a deep breath, Ruben.  (Ruben inhales deeply.)  [Trans. Lungs]     Morty:    You re not gonna die! What s your name?     Alexander:    My name is... *his hand slips from Morty s and he s coughed up* ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!  (Alexander s skin and soft tissue are peeled off as Ruben coughs into Rick s face, getting some spittle, including Alexander, on Rick s forehead.)  (The group, minus the now-dead Alexander, escape the respiratory system. Morty presses the speaker on his helmet.)     Morty:    Rick! Ruben s got tuberculosis!  [Trans. Garage]     Rick:    Oh, great work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I ll just cure it, and then 2014  (Ruben s heart monitor flatlines. Rick tosses the syringe over his shoulder.)     Rick:    Okay. Well I can t cure death. This is bad, Morty. You re trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor 2014  [Trans. Anatomy Park]     Rick:     2014and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I m biased, but, I think it s great, Morty.  [Trans. Garage]     Rick:    *sitting in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It s a bunch of pirates runnin 2019 around a-a-a- pancreas. We don t whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I m just saying, if that becomes impossible 2014  [Trans. Anatomy Park]  (The group listens to Rick, all looking glum.)     Rick:     2014please, you gotta treat yourself.  (The group is headed to the digestive tract.)     Morty:    Geez, what s that horrible smell?     Dr. Bloom:    You mean the Panda Express? *chuckles* Kidding, I-I m kidding. (As he speaks, Poncho and Roger stock up on bottled water from the Panda Express.) The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We 2019re inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed.     Morty:    Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!     Dr. Bloom:    The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There s an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.     Morty:    Everybody! Get to the colon!     Poncho:    Now I m takin 2019 orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!  (As they walk, Dr. Bloom speaks privately with Morty.)     Dr. Bloom:    Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.     Roger:    Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.  (Morty slows to walk beside Annie.)     Morty:    Hey, just so you know, I-I m actually fourteen. So, you know...     Annie:    What?     Morty:    Not twelve.     Annie:    Okay.     Morty:    Because he just said I was twelve.     Annie:    Oh. Good for you.  (She walks ahead of him.)     Rick (through       speaker):    Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one.     Morty:    *slumps forward* Nnn...  [Trans. Small intestine]  (The group travel down the small intestine in a raft, surrounded by animatronics singing  2018[[It s a Small, Small Intestine|It 2019s a Small, Small Intestine]]. 2019)     Animatronics:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>singing* It s a road of laughter, a trail of food. It s a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It s a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It s a small, small intestine!     Roger:    It goes on like this for miles...     Dr. Bloom:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>excitedly* And then we get to the   large   intestine!  (A low rumbling can be heard.)     Poncho:    Shh. <nowiki>*</nowiki>shines flashlight* I hear something.  ([[Gonorrhea]] rises up from the river of waste.)     Dr. Bloom:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>whispers* Don t move. Gonorrhea can t see us if we don t move.  (Gonorrhea roars viciously and moves towards them.)     Dr. Bloom:    Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.  (Poncho pulls out a gun, but before he can fire, Gonorrhea capsizes the boat and they all fall overboard. They swim to the  2018shore 2019 on the side of the intestine.)     Annie:    We 2019re sitting ducks!     Morty:    Doc! Didn t you say the body was filling up with gas?     Dr. Bloom:    Yes. Why?     Poncho:    Kid! You re a genius! *pulls out a match*     Dr. Bloom:    Are you mad?!     Morty:    *grabs Annie s hand* Everybody! In here!  (They all rush into a cavity in the intestinal lining. Poncho lights the match.)     Poncho:    Hey Gonorrhea! How s this for a burning sensation?  (He throws the match towards the disease, where it ignites the gas and causes an explosion. Gonorrhea falls down, dead. Annie hugs Morty, who laughs.)  [Trans. Smith family living room]  (Leonard, Summer, Joyce, Jacob, Beth, and Jerry sit in a semicircle on the carpet. Jerry scowls and slumps. Leonard is playing a set of bongos while Summer sings.)     Summer:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>singing* Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums!     Leonard:    Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha.     Summer:    Christmas drums being played by a boy!  (Beth is clapping along when she notices Jerry sulking. She puts an arm around him.)     Beth:    Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted.     Jerry:    I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I m being punished for taking your iPad.     Beth:    What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I m sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let s just be here.  ([[Ethan]] walks up to the sliding glass doors and lets himself into the house.)     Ethan:    Ugh... Summer!     Summer:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>stands up* Ethan, what are you doing here?     Ethan:    I 2019ve been texting you for hours. What the hell?!     Summer:    I don t have my phone! I m doing a human holiday!     Ethan:    Did you even consider how that might make me feel?     Summer:    How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!     Jerry:    *stands up* Summer, do you have a boyfriend?     Ethan:    Yeah, do you, Summer?     Summer:    I don t know Ethan, do I?     Jacob:    *stands up and puts a hand on Ethan and Summer s shoulders* Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man.  (Jerry stares at him, flabbergasted.)  [Trans. Anatomy Park]  (The group runs through another metal security door and hurry down a platform to a growth ray.)     Roger:    I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we ll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben s not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.  (Something roars in the distance, causing the area to rumble.)     Poncho:    What the hell is that?     Dr. Bloom:    The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load.  (The dam is clearly close to giving way. Roger keeps working to get the growth ray active.)     Roger:    Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!  (Morty notices a strange, black creature in Poncho s backpack.)     Morty:    Poncho? What is this in your backpack?  (Poncho turns around to face Morty, giving Dr. Bloom a view of the creature.)     Dr. Bloom:    That s [[Bubonic Plague|bubonic plague]]! What are you doing with that, Poncho?  (Poncho grabs hold of Annie and holds a knife to her throat. Annie gasps and tries to kick free.)     Poncho:    Everybody get back!     Dr. Bloom:    Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?     Poncho:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>laughs* That s right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I ll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you! *points the knife at Dr. Bloom* You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving 2014     Morty:    AHHHHH!!!  (Morty leaps up and grabs onto Poncho s helmet, allowing Annie to escape. He punches Poncho repeatedly before Poncho pulls him off his face and throws him to the ground, where Roger helps him up. Poncho laughs evilly, but stops short when Bubonic Plague bites his shoulder.)     Poncho:    Ah! Eh! Get! Get off! *he backs up and falls over the railing* Ahhhh!  (The four remaining look over the edge as he falls to his death. Just then, the sphincter dam begins groaning, almost giving way.)     Annie:    You guys!     Roger:    It s gonna burst! *urges the others on* Go! Go, go, go! *pulls a lever before trying to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery* My foot is stuck!  (Morty holds Annie back as she makes to help Roger.)     Annie:    No!     Roger:    This is okay! It s okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you could goo 2014  (Just then, the dam bursts, drowning Roger in Ruben s excrement.)     Annie:    No!  (Dr. Bloom seals the door to the chamber and Annie hugs Morty, distraught and crying.)  [Trans. Smith family living room]  (Leonard, Joyce, and Beth sit on the chair and sofa, Jerry and Summer stand, and Jacob kneels with Ethan in the center of the room.)     Jacob:    Let me ask you something Ethan. Where s the anger coming from, man?     Ethan:    From Summer being a total bitch!  (Jacob takes hold of Ethan s cheeks and forces him to make eye contact.)     Jacob:    Where s the anger coming from?     Ethan:    ...My brother... took me fishing once...in the bushes... *voice begins choking up as tears fill his eyes* I can t... I can t! *covers his eyes as he starts to cry* He made me feel like a girl! *sobbing openly* I m... m-made me a girl!  (Jacob helps Ethan up to his feet.)     Jacob:    He didn t make you anything, man. You are who you are. *gestures to Summer* She is who she is. (Summer watches on with a sympathetic expression.) Now you go to her. Brand new.  (Ethan walks over to Summer.)     Ethan:    Come here right now!     Summer:    Oh my god, I m so sorry Ethan! *they hug* I love you!     Ethan:    I love you so much.  (The two begin making out. Everyone claps besides Jerry.)     Jerry:    Um...     Joyce:    You did it again, cubby. Come here.  (Joyce and Jacob begin to kiss. Jerry looks to the easy chair to see Leonard has gotten up and is backing into the closet, unbuttoning his shirt to reveal a Superman costume underneath.)     Jerry:    No! Stop! I hate this!  (Beth, Joyce, and Jacob glare at him.)     Joyce:    Well, Christmas doesn t revolve around what you hate, son.     Jerry:    Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.  (He walks out. Summer and Ethan and Joyce and Jacob continue kissing.)  [Trans. Anatomy Park]  (The three survivors are in a small theater where an animatronic Ruben gives a presentation. Morty and Annie have their helmets off and are making out, and Dr. Bloom sits a few seats away eating ice cream.)     Animatronic Ruben:    My name s Ruben Ridley. You re inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I ll be inside all of you.  (Dr. Bloom appears to miss every other bite of ice cream, probably due to his semi-aqueous form.)     Animatronic Ruben:    My story begins in the dot com crash in the early  201890s.  (The animatronic sparks, then goes limp.)     Annie:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>whispering to Morty* You can put your fingers wherever you want 2026     Rick (through    speaker):    Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? (Annie and Morty    both look at Morty 2019s helmet, startled.)  [Trans. Garage]  (Rick is working on a computer, still talking to Morty through his headset.)     Rick:    I 2019m trying to concentrate.  (Jerry wanders to the door.)     Jerry:    Ah, Rick?     Rick:    *holds up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I 2019ve got much, much smaller fish to fry.     Jerry:    *enters anyway* I wanted to say I 2019m sorry I ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong table, looking down at Ruben 2019s corpse* Right now, you 2019re my sanest relative.  (Rick, who had been typing away, suddenly pauses.)     Rick:    Relative 2026 That 2019s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?  [Trans. Anatomy Park]  (Annie is in Morty 2019s lap.)     Morty:    Are you kidding? I 2019m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick.     Rick (through    speaker):    Morty, I 2019m talkin 2019 about Ruben s left nipple!     (The area begins to rumble and cave in. Morty lifts Annie off his lap and both put on their helmets.)     Morty:    We need to get to the left nipple!     Dr. Bloom:    The body is decaying! (Bits of debris begin to fall from the  2018ceiling 2019.) The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It s connected to the skeletal system. That s why we call it the [[Bone Train]]. *to Annie* Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?     Annie:    If it ll get us out of here.     Dr. Bloom:    How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?     Morty:    Why are you doing this bit? We 2019re gonna die. Let s go.  [Trans. Garage]  (Jerry looks on as Rick inserts a bundle of dynamite into an incision on Ruben s abdomen. He takes a few steps back toward the door back to the house.)     Jerry:    Well, I can see that you re busy... Merry Christmas, Rick.  (Rick lifts Ruben s corpse from the table and heads out to the car, dumping Ruben s body inside.)  [Trans.

Dr. Bloom glances at each of the teenagers. Morty and Annie continue staring at him.)     Morty:    ...Uh, well...     Dr. Bloom:    No, you re right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on.  (Something approaches the group from a nearby set of stairs.)     Annie:    <nowiki>*</nowiki>points* What the hell is that?     Dr. Bloom:    [[E. coli]] outbreak. Hurry!  (Morty and Annie jump into the shuttle as E. coli swarm the area. Dr. Bloom pulls a lever and the shuttle begins to move.)     Dr. Bloom:    Oh wait, there is an autopilot. (E. coli surround him.) WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!  (As the train speeds down the track, some of the E. coli have attached themselves to the vehicle. One smashes the window of the train door and sticks its head inside.)     Annie:    They re chewing through the doors!     Morty:    Euuuugh! *grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the E. coli off the train with it* We 2019re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we 2019re also in a really bad situation!  [Trans. Earth s orbit]  (Rick flies his spacecraft out of Earth s atmosphere.)     Rick:    I m almost there, Morty!  (Rick lights the end of the dynamite bundle in Ruben s abdomen, kicks him out into space, and uses a growth ray to increase Ruben to an enormous size 2014large enough to make Morty and Annie their normal sizes again, but still inside him.)  [Trans. Earth]  (Various people across America stop what they re doing and look at the sky as Ruben s huge, naked corpse hovers overhead.)     Reporter:    Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?  (As Tom speaks, Ruben s terrifyingly enormous face floats overhead.)  Tom: Well, his eyes aren t twinkling, and his dimples aren t merry, but I m standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!     Reporter:    Thank you, Tom. Let s go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles.  (Ruben s poorly kept toes hover in the background while Eric speaks.)     Eric:    We 2019ve got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man s size! And you know what they say about that!     Reporter:    Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains.  [Trans. Rocky Mountains]  (A lumberjack pauses while hacking down a tree, looks up, screams, and runs away.)  [Trans. Earth s orbit]  (Rick flies his ship toward the nipple.)  [Trans. Bone Train]  (E. coli continue trying to break in, with Morty beating them away with a fire extinguisher. Running up to the front of the train, he and Annie see that Hepatitis A is has damaged the track.)     Morty:    Oh my god, the track!     Annie:    It s Hepatitis A!  (As Morty tries to slow the train down, it flies off the track and straight through some of Ruben s soft tissue, bursting into the nipple. The train hits a bump, throwing Morty and Annie out. They look up and gasp.)     Annie:    The nipple hole...  (Through the nipple hole, they re able to see Earth as the sun peeks over the horizon.)     Morty:    It s beautiful...  (Suddenly, there s a crash behind them. Hepatitis A bursts out from the train wreckage and lumbers towards Morty and Annie.)     Annie:    Aw no!  (The two run, and just as Hepatitis A is about to catch them, [[Hepatitis C]] snatches it up and shakes it like felled prey.)     Annie:    Whoa! It s Hepatitis C!  (Hepatitis C gives them a thumbs-up before lumbering away with its kill in its mouth.)     Morty:    Um... We... Did we have some sort of relationship with him?     Annie:    I... think they re just like that? I think they re just good guys.     Morty:    Oh. Huh.  (Rick flies his spaceship into the nipple, landing it behind them. Morty and Annie climb inside.)     Rick:    Where s Dr. Bloom?     Morty:    Sorry Rick... He s dead...     Rick:    Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!  (Rick flies the spaceship out of the nipple and away from Ruben s corpse just before the dynamite ignites and the body explodes, sending blood and gore in all directions.)  [Trans. Smith residence]  (Joyce, Leonard, Jacob, Beth, Summer, and Ethan all bundle up to go sledding.)     Beth:    Jerry doesn t know what he s missing.     Jacob:    He ll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together.     Beth:    I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don t know if our marriage will 2014  (Beth stops talking as blood starts splattering the sliding glass doors. The whole group stares in shock as blood seems to pour from the sky.)     Summer:    It s raining blood!     Jacob:    Oh, shit. find Jerry!     Beth:    Oh god.  [Trans. Jerry s den]  (Blood is raining on the window there as well. Jerry is sitting in a chair, watching the news, when the family bursts in.)     Beth:    Jerry!     Jerry:    *stands and hugs her* It s alright! The TV says there s nothing to worry about.     Reporter (on TV):    The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine.  (Family sighs in relief.)     Summer:    Dad, can I have my phone back?     Jerry:    Sure, sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It ll help you relax.     Jacob:    This is nice.     Jerry:    Yeah. <nowiki>*</nowiki>puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob.     Summer:    No we didn t, Dad. No we didn t.  [Trans. Smith house]  (It s no longer raining blood, but reddish chunks of Ruben are everywhere as Rick lands his spacecraft, parking it in the garage.)     Rick:    Too bad about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.     Annie:    Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom s work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!     Rick:    What about Pirates of the Pancreas...?     Annie:    I think it was one of the most   underrated   attractions.     Rick:    Booyah! Hold your breath!  (Annie is already standing under the shrink ray as Rick pulls the lever, shrinking her down to microscopic size once again, much to Morty s chagrin.)     Morty:    Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin 2019 going there, Rick!  (Rick pockets the container holding Annie.)     Rick:    Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina.     Morty:    W-What s wrong with that? That doesn t sound like a problem to me! I dunno!     Rick:    C 2019mon. Let s get some stuffing, I m starving.  [Trans.

All are staring at handheld electronics as Rick and Morty enter the room.)     Rick:    Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin 2019 around with their faces stuffed in computer screens. (No one acknowledges him.) Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?  (Jerry looks at the audience and shrugs.)  [End Credits roll]  [Trans.

(etc.)     Annie:    So. Pirates of the Pancreas.     Rick:    Yeah, talk to me.     Alejandro:    Hey Rick, it s Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here,  201cOkay, what does a pancreas do? 201d (Rick begins to look agitated.) And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we 2019re starting with a new 2014  (Rick, furious, picks up and slams the phone, hanging up on the group call. Behind him, Ethan lies on a table.)     Ethan:    So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?     Rick:    Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They re inside you building a monument to compromise!

[[Morty Smith|Morty]] stops in to comment on the beautiful day before a robotic [[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth]] gets into a car and leaves for work. Rick is shown acting suspicious of the day's events, as well as Morty. Morty leaves for school and is called up to the front of the \""math class\"" by [[Mr. Goldenfold]], who asks him to teach the class, despite Morty's seemingly incorrect answer to a math question. A classmate asks Morty to share the recipe for [[concentrated dark matter]], and a reluctant Morty is nearly enticed by [[Jessica]] into doing so before Rick bursts in and pulls Morty away.  Rick tells Morty to get naked as they scramble into some locker room showers. Rick explains that they are actually trapped in a simulation of real-life by a race of 'intergalactic scammers' called [[Zigerions]]. Rick tells Morty that they'll be safe if they're naked, as the alien race is immensely uncomfortable with the sight of nudity.  Meanwhile, [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry]] has accidentally been abducted into the simulation too, and calmly goes about the day's events without noticing the numerous glitches, as his simulation is made to run on very low capacity. Jerry drives to work and gives a pitch for a marketing slogan for apples ('Hungry for Apples?'), which the board members approve. Jerry is filled with unbound confidence and promptly leaves to make love to the simulated Beth.  Rick and Morty plan an impromptu rap concert, and Rick orders the crowd to perform a wide variety of actions in order to saturate the RAM and freeze the CPU, thus, the simulation. The duo manages to escape from the simulation, sneak into the ship, steal some Crystallized Core Processing Units and proceed to an escape pod. As they fly back to Earth and return to the garage, Rick's enters the passcode to a hidden safe, which refuses to open. The garage then melts away, proving that they are still trapped in the simulation.  [[Prince Nebulon]] appears and taunts Rick for thinking he escaped, revealing that the Zigerions have always had the recipe for concentrated dark matter, but Rick pulls Morty's pants down to cause a diversion, leading to a chase throughout the ship. Back in the simulation, Jerry returns to work in order to confess his slogan is a rip-off of 'Got Milk?', but his boss is caught in an infinite loop of snapping his fingers and saying \""Yes!\"". In the span of a minute Jerry is fired, rehired, promoted, and then nominated for an 'Appley Award' (a fictional award that Jerry made up just seconds earlier). Jerry wins the award, and gives a heartfelt speech about how that day was the best day of his life, before the simulation crashes.  Rick and Morty reunite with Jerry as they attempt to find a real escape pod to use. They climb into one but are promptly pursued by Zigerion ships, and Rick decides to put together some concentrated dark matter to escape. Morty asks for the recipe, and Rick orders Morty to mix 2 parts cesium, 1 part plutonic quartz, and an entire (12oz/355mL) bottled water to create the concentrated dark matter. But then, Morty freezes with he and the ship fading away, proving that it was just Rick and Jerry in the simulation all along. Prince Nebulon reappears victorious and allows them to leave.  While throwing a victory celebration, the Zigerions mix the listed components to make the dark matter, but their ship promptly explodes, proving that Rick knew he was in a simulation since at least the time he was tricked into entering the safe combination. Rick sings the saxophone part to Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty as their shuttle flies away.  In a post-credits sequence, Jerry gives the 'Hungry for Apples?' pitch at an actual board meeting and is fired on the spot. A drunken Rick approaches the real Morty in bed, pulling a knife on him and yelling at him, calling him a \""little bitch\"" repeatedly, to prove he's not a simulation before passing out asleep.","[Open Int.

Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?     Rick:    Oh, yes, Morty. It s almost   unbelievable  , isn t it?     Morty:    Yeah, you know? There s something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.     Rick:    Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.     Morty:    Wh 2026 convincing?     Rick:    Oh! Responsive, too! In real time!

You re gonna burn out the CPU with this one.     Morty:    Okay, you know what, Rick? You re acting weird, too.

Morty:    Um, you know, it s, uh, at least 40.  (Students gasp.)     Mr. Goldenfold:    Morty, that s exactly correct! 5 x 9   is   at least 40! Come up here.  (Students cheer.)     [[Jessica]]:    Whoo! Way to go, Morty!     Mr. Goldenfold:    Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. *sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty!     Rick:    *spying from outside* Interesting 2026     Morty:    W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?     Student:    Ooh, ooh! How do you make [[concentrated dark matter]]?     Mr. Goldenfold:    Oh, that s a good question.     Morty:    Concentrated huh?     Mr. Goldenfold:    Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?     Morty:    Uhhh 2026     Jessica:    Come on, Morty. Isn t your grandpa, like, a scientist?     Morty:    Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn t go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.     Jessica:    I bet you ve seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I 2019ll be your girlfriend.     Morty:    Uh, y-you will?

Mr. Goldenfold grabs the other.)     Mr. Goldenfold:    Stop right there! If he leaves, I m giving him an F!     Rick:    He doesn t care.     Morty:    Aw, man! (Rick drags him to the locker room.) Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!     Rick:    Take a shower with me, Morty.     Morty:    What?!     Rick:    Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.     Morty:    Ugh! I m gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*     Rick:    Morty, that s not class. T-t-t-that wasn t your teacher. This isn t your school. This entire world is not the world. We re inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.     Morty:    Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?     Rick:    It 2019s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of 2026 crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn t say so until we got in the shower. They won t monitor us in here.     Morty:    Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!     Rick:    [[Zigerions|Zigerion scammers]], Morty. The galaxy s most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it s lucky for us they re also really uncomfortable with nudity.     Morty:    Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone 2019s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.     Rick:    I can 2019t let you do that, Morty.

W-w-why would you even say that?     [[Stu]]:    Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.     Prince Nebulon:    If there s a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu.     Stu:    Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. ([[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry]] appears on a large screen.) There s another real human in the simulator.     Jerry:    Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this.     Prince Nebulon:    How did this happen?! Where s the Abductions Department?     Zigerion 2:    Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order.     Zigerion 3:    Don t put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven t been simulated!     Kevin:    Well, Simulations doesn t simulate anybody that s been abducted, so 2014     Prince Nebulon:    Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one s fault. Oh, okay. I m sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There s still another human in here! Who is he?     Stu:    Rick s son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn t noticed he s in a simulation.

I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*  [Pan out to see Jerry 2019s sector of the simulation, followed by a transition to Rick and Morty 2019s.]  (Rick and Morty pant as they run naked down the street. Rick shoves their clothes into a sewer.)     Morty:    Rick!     Rick:    Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It s the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You d have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy s putting a bun between two hot dogs.     Morty:    I don t know, Rick. I mean, I 2019ve seen people do that before.     Rick:    Well, look at that old lady. She s, she s walking a cat on a leash.     Morty:    Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.     Rick:    Look, I-I-I don t wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She s an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?  (A Poptart walks out of a toaster house and into a toaster car before driving away.)     Morty:    Okay, okay, you got me on that one.     Rick:    Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven t seen that somewhere in real life before?     Morty:    No, no. I haven t seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?     Rick:    You re missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.     Morty:    So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want? 00a0     Rick:    Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you d been paying attention.  (Siren wails. Ambulance drives up to them and the doors open.)     Paramedic:    We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he ll die!  (Rick slams the ambulance doors shut and starts walking off.)     Morty:    Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.     Rick:    Yeah, it s a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they re gonna pay!     Morty:    Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?     Rick:    We ll scam the scammers, Morty. And we re gonna take them for everything they ve got.  [Trans. Ext.

Rick:    Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it s frozen, Morty, we can get to 2026the edge.

Corridor in spacecraft]     Rick:    Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That s how we re gonna scam these idiots.     Morty:    So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you re so much smarter than them?     Rick:    It s an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I m one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren t good at much, but they re really good at making these chips.     Morty:    I 2019ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one.     Rick:    Don t worry about it, Morty. There s plenty of them, you little goofball. (Both laugh and toss chips at each other playfully.) Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!     Morty:    Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!     Rick:    Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.  (They sneak towards the escape pods. Rick throws a chip and distracts the guards while they steal a pod and fly away.)     Morty:    Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.     Rick:    Totes malotes, dawg.     Morty:    Just kind of hard to believe, you know?     Rick:    Believe it, Morty. And once again, I m flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.  [Trans.

I mean, let s face it. \""Hungry for apples\"" is just a rip-off of \""Got milk?\"" It s almost identical.     Mr. Marklevitz:    *snaps fingers* Yes.     Jerry:    Okay. I deserve that.

Mr. Marklevitz:    *snaps fingers* Yes.     Jerry:    Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?     Mr. Marklevitz:    *snaps fingers* Yes.

Morty:    Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?     Rick:    Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.     Morty:    Whoa! It s all here, Rick!     Rick:    Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.     Morty:    Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.

Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He s trying to figure out if He s in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You re not. *walks back* Or are you? (Rick and Jerry leave.) *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don t have discolored butthole flaps.

[[Rick]] pleads for him to continue being his sidekick, but allows him to lead his own adventure. The two strike a bet with each other:\u00a0if the trip is a success then Morty will get to lead every tenth adventure, if the trip is a failure Morty will no longer complain. The rest of the Smith family bugs Rick for a solution to several mundane problems. Rick gives the family the [[Meeseeks Box]], a gadget capable of instantaneously summoning helpers named [[Mr. Meeseeks]]. These blue creatures exist only to solve the task at hand. Once their task is solved, the creatures instantly disappear from existence. Rick assures the family that the creatures are happy to die, and warns them to keep their tasks simple. When Rick and Morty leave, Beth asks her Meeseeks to help her become a more complete woman while Summer wants hers to make her more popular at school. Jerry put out their apparently difficult requests, asks his Meeseeks to do something comparatively simple sounding and help knock two strokes off his golf game.  Morty leads Rick on an adventure through a fantasy world. They stop at a poor village that requests the help of two heroes to help raise money for them. The villagers point towards the sky, where a world of Giants awaits. Morty and Rick climb up a giant plant stalk to the Giant's world and wait on the giant's table for him to emerge. A giant named [[Dale]], appears smelling Rick and Morty and is about to start looking for them (with the intention of eating them) when he suddenly slips over and bangs his head on the corner of the table, killing himself. Dale's wife, [[Rose]], and their son walk in and see the scene, and Rick and Morty are quickly arrested for Dale's \""murder\"".  Summer's Meeseeks quickly makes her more popular at school by giving an inspiring speech that wins her a lot of friends, while Beth's takes her on a date and gives her some encouraging advice. However, Jerry struggles to improve at golf despite the coaching from his Meeseeks. Jerry is ready to give up, but his Meeseeks can't stop existing until it completes its task and decides to summon another Meeseeks to help. It isn't long before Jerry is surrounded by several Meeseeks all desperate to get Jerry to improve since many of them haven't had to exist that long, which leads to the Meeseeks slowly losing sanity as their task fails to be completed. Soon, there are dozens of Meeseeks created but Jerry still isn't improving making everyone involved frustrated. An exasperated Beth heads to dinner and Jerry goes along, telling the complaining Meeseeks that his golf game is more their concern than his. After they've gone, all the Meeseeks blame each other for their predicament and argue over the correct solution soon descending into a massive brawl, tearing each other apart (which ''still ''doesn't kill them) while creating more and more Meeseeks to join in the fight. Eventually, the original Meeseeks, having been alive for over two days (an eternity in Meeseeks time), tells his fellows that he has a solution to permanently take all strokes off Jerry's game, by killing him.  Rick and Morty are tried in a Giant's Court but are let go thanks to a technicality. Rick tries to convince Morty to throw in the towel, but he refuses. As the duo climb down several of the Courthouse's giant stairs, they find a tavern called the [[Thirsty Step]]. Morty, still bounding with confidence about the success of his adventure, confronts Rick about his constant negative attitude before going to the bathroom. While washing his hands, he runs into [[Mr. Jellybean]]. Mr. Jellybean asks Morty about his adventure and Morty tells him that he's nervous that it might have gotten out of hand. When Mr. Jellybean points out that adventures are supposed to be full of surprises Morty cheers up and decides to \""go with the flow.\"" However, Mr. Jellybean then wraps his arms around Morty and asks him to stay and \""go with the flow.\"" Understandably unsettled by this impulsive tact Morty tries to leave before Mr. Jellybean shoves him against the sinks. Realizing that Mr. Jellybean's attempting to rape him Morty starts to panic. Unfortunately, no one can hear his screams as Rick is singing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \""Sweet Home Alabama\"" on the karaoke machine. Morty is force into one of the stalls but fortunately manages to fend Mr. Jellybean off, although he is visibly shaken afterward. Morty emerges from the bathroom and finds Rick playing cards. Rick apologizes for his previous negative attitude and tells Morty that he's having a good time as he had just won a lot of money in several games of cards. Morty on the other hand is trembling terribly and tells Rick that the adventure's over and they should just leave. Confused, Rick tells Morty that he's in the middle of a game at which point Morty tearfully breaks down and tells Rick that he'll accept losing the bet and begs Rick to take them back home. Rick pieces together what happened when he notices a bruised Mr. Jellybean leaving the bathroom and persuades Morty to get a ride down to the village and share his winnings with the townspeople. Morty cheers up, and the two leave.  Beth and Jerry go out to dinner, and the horde of Mr. Meeseeks descend on the restaurant wielding various weapons. Jerry and Beth escape into the restaurant's freezer, and the Mr. Meeseeks began taking hostages to coerce Jerry to come out. Jerry almost gives in, but Beth encourages him to try his golf swing one last time. Jerry emerges from the freezer and uses a severed pipe and tomato to prove that his swing has improved. The Mr. Meeseeks celebrate and disappear, all except for one 'stickler' Mr. Meeseeks who takes a hostage and asks to see Jerry's short game. Jerry hits an onion into a coffee cup, which finally dispatches all of the Mr. Meeseeks.  After sharing their remaining money with the villages, Rick congratulates Morty on a successful adventure and agrees that Morty has won the bet. The villagers then ask Rick and Morty to meet their king, who turns out to be Mr. Jellybean. Morty quickly declines and Rick opens the portal to home. The duo quickly hop through the portal and leave as quickly as possible. However, not content with allowing Mr. Jellybean to get away with his attempted rape, Rick quickly re-opens the portal and his hand emerges from the portal with a laser gun, which he uses to shoot and kill Mr. Jellybean, much to the horror of the villagers.  The trauma of the restaurant incident helps patch together Jerry and Beth's relationship for the time being.  In an after-credits scene, one of the villagers is sadly looking at the memorial statute made in honor of Mr. Jellybean when his squire arrives with shoe-box filled with photographs, clearly frazzled by something. He tells the villager that the box had been found in a locked chest in the closet of Mr. Jellybeans estate. The villager looks at the photographs and gags at the horrifying discovery. His squire suggests that they tell the people, but the villager orders him to burn it instead, claiming that the villagers would be better off remembering Mr. Jellybean for the idea that he represented to them rather than for his true disgusting nature. The episode ends with a shot of his (rather suggestive) statue of his with his arms around a child in his underwear.","[Open Ext.

I m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Thank you!     Principal Gene V.   : Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it? Yeah. Gene Vagina. Listen, I m in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- (Meeseeks 1 stops existing)- No, I ll get your info from Summer.  (Cut to Beth and Meeseeks 2 at a restaurant sitting outside)     Beth   : I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I m successful, but what if I hadn t...-(Meeseeks 2 stares attentively)- I m just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon.     Meeseeks 2   : She s still there, Beth.     Beth   : Well, her waistline isn t.     Meeseeks 2   : Beth, having a family doesn t mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.     Beth   : You re saying I should leave Jerry. (Beth starts to cry) I can t believe I m finally having this conversation.  (Meeseeks 2 stops existing as Beth leans in to kiss him)     Waiter (man)   : More wine?     Beth   : I think I ve had enough.  (Cut to Jerry at a golf course with Meeseeks 3)     Meeseeks 3   : Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry.     Jerry   : Yeah, yeah. I got it.  (Jerry misses the ball completely)     Meeseeks 3   : That s okay. I m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down.     Jerry   : Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down?     Meeseeks 3   : Well, it s both. But most importantly, you got to relax.     Jerry   : You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don t think this is working. I give up.     Meeseeks 3 (nervous)   : I m sorry, Jerry, but it doesn t work like that. I m Mr. Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me.     Jerry   : Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck.     Meeseeks 3   : No, Jerry, I m the one who SUCKS! Let me try something.  (Meeseeks 3 spawns in another Meeseeks)     Meeseeks 4   : I m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!     Meeseeks 3   : Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.     Meeseeks 4   : Hi!     Meeseeks 3   : Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry s golf swing?     Meeseeks 4   : Can do! I m Mr. Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared?     Meeseeks 3   : Ooh, he s trying!  (Cut to Rick and Morty on a table in a giant building)     Rick   : All right, Morty. We re in your stupid giant s castle. What do we do next?     Morty   : Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It s nice and simple. You know, I m sorry everything s going so smoothly and adventurously.  (A giant can be heard walking down the hall)     Rick (sarcastic)   : Uh-oh, Morty. Startin  to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss?     Morty   : Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.     Giant   : Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!     Rick   : Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I ll take us home right now. You just say the word.     Morty   : No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.     Giant   : I smell the blood of- whoop!(the giant falls and cracks his head open on the table corner before hitting the ground)     Morty   : Holy crap.     Rick   : Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he s bleeding out.  (A giant woman walks in holding a baby)     Giant woman   : Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He s dying!  (Cut to Rick and Morty at a giant jail and getting mug shots)     Detective   : Hey, look, we get it. You re little, you re down on your luck, you think, \""hey, he s a giant. Why don t we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?\""     Morty   : Th-th but that s not how it went down!     Detective   : Oh, well, it s going down like that. You re both going down like that.     Rick   : Ooh, boy, Morty, you re really showing me how it s done. Real straightforward and fun.  (Cut to the Smith dining room and living room where Jerry is still frustrated, while Summer and Beth look much happier)     Summer   : Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you.     Beth   : The most important love you can receive is from yourself.  (Several meeseeks now fill the living room, trying to help)     Meeseeks   : Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!     Jerry   : Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!     Meeseeks   : Aww, come on, Jerry, we ve been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.     Jerry   : Don t tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!     Meeseeks   : Just try to relax.     Jerry   : You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox! (Jerry walks to the dinning room) Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can t imagine what you two must be going through.     Beth   : Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.     Jerry   : You re kidding me.     Beth   : Notice anything different?     Jerry   : I m sorry. Hours?     Summer   : Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her!     Meeseeks   : Uhh... Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don t usually have to exist this long. It s getting weird.  (Cut to Rick and Morty in a giant courthouse)     Judge   : Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.     Rick (sarcastic)   : Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it s gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it ll be really easy to rape us after that.     Morty   : We re gonna be okay, Rick.     Rick   : How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think s gonna happen, some magical angel s gonna show up and then-(the court doors burst open and a giant in a suit walks down the isle.)     Giant Lawyer   : Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I m from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.  (Murmers of confusion spread throughout the court)     Rick   : W-what the hell is he talking about?     Giant Lawyer   : They re free to go, is what I meant. I m deconstructing our our our thing we say. We re giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.     Morty   : Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!  (Rick and Morty appear outside the courthouse)     Rick   : All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun s still working. You ready to head home?     Morty   : Oh, yeah, you d like that, wouldn t you, Rick? Well, you know what? We re not bailing out just yet. You know, we re gonna go find some treasure or something and and we re gonna bring it to those villagers.     Rick   : Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash.     Morty   : Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.  (They look down the stairs and see that each step is as tall as a large building. The stairs seem to go on forever)     Rick   : Oh, boy, Morty.     Morty   : Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.     Rick   : What do you say, Morty?     Morty   : I say give me a hand, sidekick.  (Cut to the Smith livingroom. Dozens of meeseeks fill the room whining, groaning and desperately trying to help Jerry.)  NOTE: to make this easier an * will be put next to meeseeks every time a different meeseeks talks.     Jerry   : Everybody shut up! Let me try! (Jerry swings and misses again) Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!     Beth   : I m going out.     Jerry   : Wait. What?     Beth   : Well, you re busy. I m hungry. I thought I d go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?     Jerry   : Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, I ll take you to dinner.     All the Meeseeks   : AWWWWWWW!     Jerry   : Hey, you know what? It s hard being me, too. I ll be right there. Look, I ve got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.  (Exit Beth and Jerry)     Meeseeks   : I can t take it anymore. I just want to die!     Meeseeks *   : We all want to die! We re Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this?     Meeseeks *   :  Cause he roped me into this!     Meeseeks *   : Well, him over there, he roped me into this!     Meeseeks *   :Well, he roped me into this!     Meeseeks *   : Well, what about me? He roped me into this.     Meeseeks *   : Well, that one over there roped me into this.     Meeseeks *   : Well, he roped me into this.  (Cut to Rick and Morty climbing down a step like it s a mountian)     Rick   : Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.     Morty   : All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn t be included, stupid. (They see an opening in one of the steps)  Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.  (Rick and Morty appear in the tavern)     Morty   : Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there s little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It s whimsical and fun.  (Rick sees a creature staring at him)     Rick   : What are you looking at, motherfucker?     Morty   : Easy, Rick.  (A strange looking waitress with large boobs greets them at their table)     Waitress   : Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We ve got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies.     Rick   : Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?     Morty   : Rick... We ll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?     Slippery   : Y all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair. I ll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.     Rick   : 25 shmeckels? I don t know how much I don t know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?     Waitress   : That s exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.     Mr. Booby Buyer   : Hi, I m Mr. Booby Buyer. I ll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.     Waitess   : It s a tempting offer, but I m gonna have to decline.     Mr. Booby Buyer   : Rats! What a shame.     Rick   : Morty, your adventure s in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out.     Morty   : You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?     Rick   : Uh, because it s lame?     Morty   : It s because you re petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can t you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven t learned how to lighten up, don t be here!     Rick   : Whatever.  (Cut to the Smith living room with all the Meeseeks)     Meeseeks   : It s become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry s follow-through, we will solve this problem. I m Mr. Meeseeks.     Meeseeks *   : I m Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that s clear is that choking up is the one true solution.     Meeseeks 3   : Look at me. I m Mr. Meeseeks. I ve been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing s worked. I fear the worst.     Meeseeks   : Your failures are your own, old man. I m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who s with me?! Follow-through!  (A Meeseeks spawns in another Meeseeks)     New Meeseeks   : I m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!     Meeseeks   : Kill him!     New Meeseeks   : Hisssss! (He attacks another meeseeks)  (Cut to Morty in the bathroom)     Mr. Jelly Bean   : How are you today? I m Mr. Jelly Bean!     Morty   : Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I m Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure.     Mr. Jelly Bean   : Nice. Is it a fun adventure?     Morty   : I hope so. But I m starting to get nervous that maybe it s gone a little too far off the rails.     Mr. Jelly Bean   : Well, isn t that what adventures do?     Morty   : Hey, you know what? You re right. Everything s going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow.     Mr. Jelly Bean:    Yeah. (He rubs Morty s sholders)     Morty   : Okay. Uh. B-bye.     Mr. Jelly Bean   : Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow!     Morty   : Stop. You re making me really uncomfortable.  (Mr. Jelly Bean clearly wants to rape Morty)     Mr. Jelly Bean (aggresive)   : Stop fighting me! Just let this happen!     Morty   : Get off of me!  (cut to Rick singing karaoke)     Rick   :  266a       Sweet home Alabama. Wooooo!        266a  (back to Morty, the fighting makes it to a stall)     Morty   : Whoo! No! Stop! Please!     Mr. Jelly Bean   : Stop being such a fucking tease, you sweet little twat!     Morty   : No! No!  (Morty gets the upper hand and, in a frenzied attack, slams the toilet seat on Mr. Jelly Bean s head until he is knocked out. Morty sits down on the ground out of breath, and yells in horror of what just happened as he stares at the jellybeans blood on his hands.)  (Back at the Smith house, even more Meeseeks have spawned and a full out battle has started. However, even the badly hurt Meeseeks cannot die because they have not completed their task)     Meeseeks   : Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done.     Meeseeks *   : The job can t be done! We ll never get two strokes off his game!     Meeseeks   : No, we won t. But we will get all strokes off his game.  All other Meeseeks: Where s he going with this? What does he mean?     Meeseeks   : When we kill him!  (Loud hooting and joy from the meeseeks crowd)  (Cut to Jerry and Beth at dinner)     Beth   : Jerry, maybe it s time I take that trip I always talk about.     Jerry   : Where would you go?     Beth   : I don t know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina.     Jerry   : Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?  (A loud noise is heard and the glass window breaks with a hoard of Meeseeks angrily storming in)     Jerry   : What the heck?     Meeseeks   : There he is!     Beth   : Run, Jerry!  (Beth and Jerry lock themselves in a freezer with a small window in the door)     Meeseeks   : Come on out, Jerry!     Jerry   : Guys, I ll choke up. I ll follow through. I ll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?     Meeseeks   : Oh, we re well past that, Jerry.  (Cut to Rick at a card table with some other characters)  Card Player: Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?     Rick   : Read  em and weep, fellas! (Morty comes back) Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I m really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I m havin  a good time, Morty. It s not so bad.     Morty    (very stressed): Let s just go home, okay? I m calling it. The adventure s over.     Rick   : We can t leave now, Morty. I m on fire!     Morty   : Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay? (Searches Rick s lab coat for the portal gun) Just give me the portal gun and let s go, please!   (Rick sees the badly beaten Mr. Jelly Bean walk out of the bathroom and pieces together what happened)     Morty   : Please, I just want to... go h-home. (Tears up and holds onto Rick)     Rick   : Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don t we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we ll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?     Morty   : Really?     Rick   : Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.  (Outside on the steps)     Slippery   : Buckle up! (He starts to take them down)  (Cut back to the freezer)     Meeseeks (presumably 3)   : Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask... (Meeseeks grabs a woman) ...what s your name, ma am?     Woman   : Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants!     Jerry   : Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre?  (Beth takes a stand, tears a pipe off of a rack, and grabs Jerry off the ground)     Beth   : Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you.     Meeseeks (presumably 3)   : I m counting to three, Jerry.  (Jerry opens the door, as everyone watches. Using the pipe, he swings at a tomato. It lands into a pot)     All Meeseeks   : Ooooohhh!     Samantha   : What the fuck is going on?     All Meeseeks   : He s got it! That s a lower handicap stro-o-ke!  (All the Meeseeks stop existing except 1)     Meeseeks   : Excuse me. I m a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game?  (The meeseeks grabs Samantha and puts a knife up to her neck)     Samantha (Crying)   : Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?!   (Jerry grabs an onion and puts it on the ground. He swings the pipe again, and it rolls into a nearby cup)      Meeseeks   : Ooh, nice! (Stops existing)     Jerry (Kisses Beth)   : I think we ll take our food to go.     Owner   : No, you won t. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer.     Jerry   : Fair enough.  (Rick and Morty return to the village in triumph)     The First Villager   : Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes!     Rick   : Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.     Morty   : Thanks, Rick, but I don t know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It s a crazy and chaotic place.     Rick   : Well, you know, maybe that s why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one s wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.     The First Villager   : Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally.  (The badly beaten Mr. Jelly Bean is carried to towards them on a thrown)     Morty   : Uh, no, I-it s cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry.  (They portal away, but Rick makes another portal back and sticks an energy pistol through it and shoots Mr. Jelly Bean, splattering him all over the screaming villagers)  (Back at the Smith house)     Jerry   : So... You still thinking about taking that trip?     Beth   : Jerry, look. We don t have a perfect marriage, but I m not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to \""complete their task.\""     Jerry   : Was I one of those guys?     Beth   : The difference is you didn t disappear afterwards.     Jerry   : Well... I got you pregnant.     Beth   : Yeah...     Rick   : What the hell happened to this place?     Beth   : Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn t take two strokes off Jerry s golf game. He felt terrible.     Rick   : Hey, it s not my fault that Jerry s an idiot.     Beth   : Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?     Rick   : Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.     Jerry   : No. No more boxes.     Rick   : What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dub! (Everyone laughs) Yeah! That s my new thing! I m kind of like what s his name Arsenio. Isn t that it s what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody.     Beth   : I don t get it.  (After the end credits at the village)     Villager 1   : Sir, I think you re going to want to see this. We found it inside a lockbox inside king Jelly Bean s closet. (A box of pictures of many young boys Mr. Jelly Bean molested) We have to tell the people.     Villager 2   : Wait. Destroy it. (They set the box on fire) Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was.  (They stare and walk away from a statue of Mr. Jelly Bean standing next to a young boy with his hand on his shoulder)  (End of Meeseeks and Destroy)  "

With the annual Flu Season Dance coming up, Morty talks to [[Jerry]] about his issue. Jerry compares Morty's fondness for Jessica to his own fondness for [[Beth]] when he was a teenager. [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] overhears Jerry's story and reminds him that said fondness resulted in Jerry getting Beth pregnant at 17. Rick proceeds to warn Morty not to go to Jerry for romantic advice because, \""his marriage is hanging on by a thread\"". An insulted Jerry remarks that there isn't a problem with his marriage. Unconvinced, Rick tells Jerry that he can believe what he wants but it's pretty obvious that Beth is looking for an excuse to leave him. Morty becomes upset and asks Rick not to talk about his parents in that fashion. In response, Rick tells Morty that what people interpret as, \""love\"" is just a chemical that causes animals to breed and once that has happened, any true passion fades away. After Rick leaves, a depressed Morty goes upstairs to prepare for the dance and a nervous Jerry goes to check on Beth. Thinking about what Rick told him, Morty approaches Rick and requests a potion that can make Jessica like him. After a brief argument, Rick calls Morty a, \""thorn in his ass\"" and gives Morty a serum based off the genetic makeup of voles, a rodent that pair bonds with its mate for life. Before leaving, Morty asks if there's anything that could go wrong with the serum and Rick answers no. Once Morty has left, however, Rick quickly adds, \""unless she has the flu\"", but shrugs it off.  At the dance, Morty uses the serum on Jessica, and, save for her dilated pupils, it seems to be a success. When Brad sees Jessica holding Morty, he becomes angry and tries to wrestle him away from her. Things only get worse when Jessica begins to sneeze. The serum, which has piggy-backed onto the flu virus and has caused the virus to replicate in seconds, is seen to go airborne, infects Brad with the serum. Brad quickly apologizes to Morty but begins to make sexual advances on Morty which leads to another scuffle between Jessica and Brad. Eventually [[Principal Vagina]] leads Brad away, while Brad sneezes causing the serum laced flu virus to enter the fruit punch and air vents. Soon everyone at the dance is infected with the flu and subsequently the serum. Morty prays that everything go according to plan, when Jessica starts aggressively telling Morty to have sex with her on the spot, in front of the entire school. Morty is unsurprisingly mortified and Jessica's friend tells her to control herself, before she begins to make advances on Morty as well. Morty slowly backs up and notices that everyone in the room now has dilated pupils and they're all looking at him lustfully. Realizing what has happened with dread, Morty feebly whimpers, \""Oh, crap!\"". The students and faculty swarm around Morty, with each of them violently competing to have Morty for themselves. Morty eventually manages to get away from everyone and makes a break for the exit where Rick is waiting for him. Rick tells Morty that he realized that he messed up and explains how this all happened. Terrified, Morty asks Rick what they're going to do and Rick tells him that he's already whipped up an antidote using praying mantis DNA as the base, claiming that they're the, \""opposite of voles\"" due to their nature to only mate once before the female devours the male.    Rick releases his antidote along with a second, more powerful airborne virus. Upon releasing the new airborne serum, Rick tells Morty that the serum doesn't affect anyone related to Morty by blood so luckily it means none of his family will want to have sex with him. For a moment, the antidote appears to have been successful, until everybody starts growing mantis-like features and other appendages. Now not only do they still wish to copulate with Morty but also have the urge to behead and eat him afterward. This Mantis-love virus soon infects the entire Earth population, all of which not only wish to mate with Morty but consume him afterwards.  Meanwhile, Jerry approaches Beth and asks her if she still loves him. Beth tells Jerry that loving him is the equivalent of building a homeless shelter, work that nobody wants to do but people who care will do so anyway. She then is called in to work late to help out with some horses after an incident at the racetrack and Jerry begins to suspect she may be having an affair. Despite [[Summer Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Summer]]'s warnings, Jerry decides to stop by [[St. Equis Hospital]] where his wife works. On the way, he encounters a massive roadblock on the highway and is confronted by several mutated victims. Finding a shotgun in an abandoned police car, Jerry arms himself and shoots his way through the horde. After a successful surgery, Beth's coworker [[Davin]] makes a move before being infected by the Mantis-love virus. Just then, Jerry, in tattered clothes, busts in with a crowbar and beats him to death. Meanwhile, Rick and Morty travel to a secluded area in the desert. While Rick tries to concoct a third serum to undo all of his previous work Morty is watching the news and is horrified to find that the virus has spread across the entire planet. Rick then claims that he has created the solution by taking the DNA from several sources, including koala, rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, golden retriever, shark, and dinosaur. Morty is confused by Rick's concoction and asks how it would put people back to normal, but only gets chastised by Rick for questioning him. As they fly over the town, Rick tries to build up hype so he can rub his supposed success in Morty's face, until Morty finally just grows tired of Rick's arrogance and releases the third airborne virus himself. At first the serum seems to have worked, as some people are returned to normal, but just as quickly, people begin turning into disfigured, humanoid blobs that Rick dubs \""[[Cronenbergs]].\"" Rick then sarcastically says, \""You're welcome.\"" to Morty, claiming that he made him the, \""mayor of, 'I told you so town'\"". The world is soon overrun with these disfigured monsters, and Jerry and Beth fight their way through them to survive, eventually reuniting with Summer.  As dawn breaks, Rick and Morty sit upon a rooftop overlooking the chaos around them. Rick tries to be light-hearted and jokingly points out that no one wants to have sex with Morty any more so they must be going in the right direction. Morty, on the other hand, is still absolutely horrified by the fact that the world was in ruin and asks Rick how he could have been so irresponsible. Not willing to take the blame, Rick reminds Morty that he was the one who asked for the serum to begin with, and claimed that Morty was a total creep. Morty accepts his responsibility for the disaster but he quickly reminds Rick that he was the one who botched the original serum, mixed a bunch of random genes together, hoped for the best and ended up turning the entire world population into Cronenbergs.   Furthermore, Morty declares that Rick had to figure out a way to fix everything. At wits end for what to do, Rick then ultimately decides to use his final emergency solution. The scene cuts to Rick and Morty's garage, with Morty congratulating Rick on saving the world from the Cronenbergs. Rick asks Morty for his screwdriver, and gladly begins to finish his invention from earlier. Just as Rick twists the screw the third time, the device violently explodes, instantly (and messily) killing Rick and Morty. The Rick and Morty from the rooftop scene then step out from a portal, and Morty panics at the sight of incredibly bloody garage with the corpses of him and his grandfather lying limp and burnt on ground; until Rick calms him down by telling Morty that there are an infinite number of realities and in a few of them he managed to save the world from the viruses. Rick further explains the he just had to find one of those realities in which they died soon afterwards so that they could come in and take their place. <nowiki> </nowiki>A still horrified Morty asks Rick what was going to happen to the world they left behind only for Rick to tell him there's nothing they can do, so they shouldn't think about it. Rick further remarks that Morty should be glad that he messed as much as he did because if he hadn't, they would have been the versions of themselves that died in an explosion. The episode ends with Rick and Morty, burying their dead bodies in the backyard. Upon finishing, Morty, with a [[Wikipedia:Thousand-yard stare|thousand-yard stare]], returns into the house in a daze, looks around at his new home and sits on the couch, clearly shell-shocked by all that has happened.  After the credits, the remainder of the Smith family of the Cronenberged dimension is shown living out of a van fitted with armor and survival equipment and roasting a dead Cronenberg over a fire. Summer creates her own TV shows standing in a cardboard box while her parents, Jerry and Beth, admit they don't miss Rick and Morty at all and despite the world falling apart, they have actually found happiness. Meanwhile, [[Cronenberg Rick]] and [[Cronenberg Morty]] transport from a reality they call [[Cronenberg World]] in which Cronenberg Rick accidentally turned everyone into normal human beings.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

[Open ext. [[Harry Herpson High School]]]  [Trans. int. Harry Herpson High School hallway]  ([[Morty Smith|Morty]] is standing at his locker.)     [[Principal Vagina]]:    (Over the intercom, while the students talk) Principal Vagina here, don t let the name fool you, I m very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don t know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don t bring dead babies to Passover.  (Morty watches [[Jessica]] with her friends [[Grace Smith]] and [[Holly Hooks]] at a nearby locker.)     [[Grace Smith]]:    (to Jessica) Hey.     Morty:    Ohhh. Okay, here we go. *Walks over to Jessica and her friends* (Nervously) H-Hey, Jessica, ughh.     Jessica:    What s up, Morty? *sneezes*     Morty:    Ugghh-     [[Brad]]: *   Butts in, in front of Jessica*       What are you doing?     Morty:    Ummm...     Brad:    Wait, wait. Were you about to talk... to her?     Morty:    Well, I mean, I was thinking about it.     Brad:    Dude- (hand hits Morty s chest) stay in your league! Look at how hot she is! You don t see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hittin  on their prettiest girl!     Jessica:    (Sarcastically) Gee, thanks, Brad.  (Brad puts his arm around Jessica s shoulder and the pair walk away.)     Brad:    I throw balls far. You want good words, date a languager.  (Morty stands at the locker alone and looks down in disappointment)  [Trans. ext. The Smith s house]  [Trans. int. The Smith s kitchen]  ([[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] is making a sandwich and talking to Morty at the counter)     Jerry:    Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You re a good kid, and there s not a premium on that right now, but you ll be getting girls sometime after Brad s out of shape.     Morty:    (Plays with a cookie in sadness) You re missing the point, Dad. I don t want girls, I want Jessica!     Jerry:    Ahhh, well, (gets another jar of sauce out of the cupboard) I remember feeling that way about a young lady named [[Beth Smith|your mom]], and that s not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...     [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]:    (enters and interrupts Jerry) I should get her pregnant, then she ll have to marry me. (grabs a glass from a cupboard)     Jerry:    I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE. (points to Morty)     Rick:    (grabs ice from out of the freezer)(sarcastically) Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school. (gets juice out of the refrigerator) I m not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.     Jerry:    (Angrily) My marriage is fine, thank you.  (Rick walks towards Jerry)     Rick:    Jerry, it s your house, whatever you say it is is how it is, (pours juice into the glass) but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.     Morty:    Come on, Rick, don t talk about my parents like that.  (Rick walks around counter, to Morty)     Rick:    Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call \""love\"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. (exits room, drinking juice)  (Jerry walks next to Morty)     Morty:    (In woe) Alright, well, I m gonna go get dressed for the dance. (exits kitchen)     Jerry:    Yeah, I m just going to...check on your mom. (exits opposite direction)  [Trans. ext. The Smith s house]  [Trans. int. The Smith s garage]  (Rick is working on a machine, on his desk, as Morty enters, in his suit)     Rick:    (With his back to Morty) Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? *Morty closes door* I m almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It s gonna be great.     Morty:    Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? (walks to Rick at his desk) Well, I was thinkn , you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica s mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?     Rick:    Morty, that s such a poor use of my time, it s beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver. (points to the shelf)     Morty:    (Angrily) YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I m never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick. (Rick gets up and grabs a box of supplies from the shelf) I m always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can t you just help me out once, once, for once?     Rick: *   sighs* You re growing up fast, Morty. You re growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass! (grabs some test tubes with yellow liquid and holds one up) Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?  (Morty shakes his head as Rick walks away from the shelf)     Rick:    It s a, it s a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal s brain, (sets down the box of objects, opens a hatch in a machine, and pours the oxytocin in) ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta *burps* combine it with some of your DNA.     Morty:    Oh well, okay... (zips down his fly)     Rick:    A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn t   Game Of Thrones. (  plucks hair from Morty s head)     Morty:    Oww!  (Rick drops the hair in the machine and closes the hatch) (The machine vibrates and makes noises, then pours an orange liquid into a conical flask, much like a coffee machine)     Rick:    (grabs the flask containing the orange liquid) Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?  (Rick hands the potion to Morty, and walks away)     Morty:    Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick! (walks to the door, but thinks about it and looks back) Hey there s no dangers or anything or side effects, right?     Rick:    Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it s full proof.  (Morty leaves the garage as Rick works on the ionic defibulizer some more)     Rick:    Ugh, unless she has the flu. (shrugs it off)  <nowiki>*</nowiki>suspense music*  [Trans Beth and Jerry s room]  (Beth is typing on the computer, while Jerry is sadly sitting on their bed)     Jerry:    Beth, do you still love me?     Beth: *   sighs* Want kinda question is that?     Jerry:    The \""yes\"" or \""no\"" kind. *weak laugh of obviousness*     Beth:    Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?     Jerry:    Yess.     Beth:    Are you gonna build them?     Jerry:    Noo.     Beth:    Then what good was the \""yes\""?     Jerry:    (walks to Beth at the computer)(confused) Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?     Beth:    (Turns around to Jerry)(Irritated) Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say \""no\"" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?     Jerry:    Sort of.     Beth:    But I obviously sort of love you, don t I? *alert on Beth s phone* So stop asking and maybe I ll love you more. (looks at her phone) Crap, They need me at the horse hospital.  (Beth gets up and grabs her jacket at the door)     Jerry:    This late?     Beth:    (puts on her jacket) The racetrack had a starlit derby, there s a seven horse collision, and Davin s there alone. (leaves the room, leaving Jerry alone)     Jerry:    (In his head)(Progressively angrier) *  Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin*    [Trans. ext. Herry Herpson High School, Gymnasium entrance]  (Dressed up students walk inside in pairs, a large banner reads \""FLU SEASON DANCE\"" over the doors)  [Trans int. Flu Season Dance inside Gymnasium]  (Morty happily walks passed many students eating and dancing, a band plays   Flu Hatin  Rap   in the background)     Band Vocalist / MC Haps:    (Background)         Flu. Yo, you gotta be aware. Aware about the flu, up in the air. Imma get me a shot and make the flu go away. Flu hatin  rappers just rappin  away. Yo. Yo. Flu hatin  rapper.

(Morty sees Jessica and her friends, he takes out a vial of the potion and pours it onto his hand, he then approaches them)     Morty:    Hey there, Jessica. (Pretends to trip, wiping the potion on Jessica s arm) Whooa-whoopsie!  (Jessica turns around and becomes infected, falling in love with Morty)     Jessica:   (infected)       Omigod, Morty. You look REALLY nice tonight.     Morty:    WOW, thanks!  (Jessica pulls Morty close to her breasts)     Jessica:   (infected) I love you, Morty. I love you so much it burns!     Morty:    Oh man. I love you too, Jessica! (Brad walks passed with a drink, he overhears)     Brad:    (outraged) *spits* Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?(shoves Morty)     Jessica:    (Infected) LEAVE HIM ALONE, JERK! (pulls Morty away) I M IN LOVE WITH HIM! HE S MORE MAN THEN YOU WILL EVER BE! *sneezes*  (Jessica sneezes infected bacteria into Brad s mouth) (You can more promptly hear the band s rap as the green spheres of bacteria spread throughout Brad s body, through his blood and nerves)     Brad:    (infected) Aw man, Morty, ugh, I m really sorry.     Morty:    Oh, well, no problem Brad.     Brad:    (hugs Morty)(infected) There s somethin  special bout you, somethin  special. (squeezes Morty s butt and back)     Morty:    (pushes Brad away) Whoa, take it easy!     Jessica:    (grabs Morty s left arm)(infected) GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!     Brad:    (grabs Morty s right arm)(infected) BACK OFF I M TRYING TO BE WITH MY MAN!  (Brad and Jessica quarrel over Morty)     Principal Vagina:    (Stops the fight, pulling Brad back, aided with Mr. Goldenfold) That s enough Bradley. We don t want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.  (Principal Vagina and Mr. Goldenfold drag Brad away)     Brad:    (disappointment)(infected) Oh, Principal Vagina.  (Jessica takes Morty away, grasping his head)     Jessica:    (infected) Never leave me, Morty, NEVER.  (Morty and Jessica hold each other) (Nearby students begin to watch)     Morty:    (confused) Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?     Jessica:    (infected) Who cares? Just hold me.  (Trans. Principal Vagina and Mr. Goldenfold dragging distraught Brad outside of the gym)     Brad:    (infected) LET ME GO!!! I LOVE YOU MORTY! *sneeze, sneeze* (exits the gym)  (Brad sneezes infected bacteria into a nearby punch bowl, then again into a vent) *suspenseful music*  [Trans. ext. Smith House]     Jerry:    (V.O.) She s gonna be alone with that guy all night.  [Trans. Smith Living Room]     Summer:    Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It s not a very romantic setting.  Rick: Well, Summer, there s always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up.  Maybe davin s digging around in herinsides.  Summer: Grandpa, so gross!  You re talking about my mom.  Rick: Well, she s my daughter, Summer.  I outrank you.  Or family means nothing, in which case don t play that card.  Jerry: She s not responding to my texts!  Summer: Careful, dad.  Jealousy turns women off.  Jerry: Well, isn t that convenient?  Rick: Not for the men they cheat on, no.  Jerry: Okay, I m... going to go out... for some ice cream.  And maybe stop by the hospital... to support my wife... with my confidence.  [Door closes]  Summer: God, grandpa, you re such a dick.  Rick: I m sorry, Summer.  Your opinion means very little to me.  How come you re not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much?  Summer: Screw that.  I don t want to get sick.  It s flu season.  Rick: It is?  Summer: Yeah.  Rick: Uh-oh.  [Hip-hop music plays]  Morty: Please just let this work out.  [Moans] Do it, Morty. Do it.  Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life!  [Growls]  Morty: Um... can we maybe go somewhere more private?  Jessica, get a hold of yourself!  [Grunts]  You don t deserve to carry Morty s genes.  [Rapping]   266a I love Morty  266a  266a and I hope Morty loves me  266a  266a I d like to wrap my arms around him  266a  266a and feel him inside me  266a  Morty: Oh, crap.  [Indistinct shouting]  Morty!  Rick: Morty, come on!  We got to get you out of here.  You re not gonna believe this because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake.  [Both panting] come on, Morty.  We got to get out of here.  Come on.  Morty!  Morty: [wails] are you okay?  Morty: I m fine!  Oh, good.  If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself.  I love you bad, mo-mo!  [All panting]  [indistinct shouting]  Morty, the principal and I have discussed it, a-a-and we re both insecure enough to agree to a three-way!  Rick: I didn t realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty.  Morty: What the hell is going on, Rick?  Rick: What does it look like?  T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus.  It s gone airborne, Morty.  Morty: Oh, crap.  What are we gonna do, Rick?  Rick: It s gonna be fine, Morty, relax.  I whipped up and antidote.  It s based on praying-mantis dna.  You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty.  I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner.  I mean, it s a whole ritual.  It s really gruesome and totally opposite.  There s no love at all.  I-i-i basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.  It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty.  It ll all be over very shortly.  [Indistinct shouting]  Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn t ask or anything, but I m not interested in having s*x with you.  These serums, they don t work on anybody related to you genetically.  Morty!  [All groaning]  Rick: Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty.  A lot of people don t get that.  Jerry: [gasps]  [tires screech]  Come on. Are you kidding me?  Hello!  Morty!  You re not Morty!  Bring us Morty!  [Gun cocks]  Jerry: Nobody s killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.  I had s*x with billy.  But you were already pregnant!  Yeah, so what s the worst that could happen?  We interrupt \""pregnant baby\"" with breaking news.  Summer: [groans] Come on.  This just in Morty smith s whereabouts are still unknown.  Summer: What the hell?  The only thing that is known is... how cute he is.  I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head.  I love him more than you do, harold!  You wish, you stupid bitch!  Morty s mine!  Morty s mine!  Meant to be together!  [Speaking arabic]  Morty!  [Speaking arabic]  [banging on door]  Where is Morty?  Summer: [screams]  [conversing in native language]  Morty: Oh, my god, Rick.  The whole world is infected!  Rick: Yeah, it s pretty wild how fast that spread.  I ve really outdone myself.  Morty: Outdone yourself?!  W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick?  This is not okay!  Not only do they all want to have s*x with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards!  Rick: Yeah, I don t know what I was thinking.  Mantises are they opposite of voles?  I mean, obviously, dna s a little more complicated than that.  You know what, though, Morty?  This right here s gonna do the tRick, baby.  It s koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur.  Should add up to normal humanity.  Morty: I don t that doesn t make any sense, Rick.  How does that add up to normal humanity?  Morty: What, Morty, you want me to show you my math?  I m sorry a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid?  [Exhales deeply] Well, I m glad we saved all those horses, but I m almost sorry we re finished.  Beth: Yes, it s satisfying work.  Unh-unh-unh, it s, uh it s more than the work.  I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world.  It s the only time I can really think... and feel.  [Slow music plays]  Beth: Hmm, uh, what are you doing?  I m playing african dream pop.  What do youdo after a long night?  [Click]  Beth: Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I d better get going.  Um, Jerry s been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.  Beth...  Beth: What is it, davin?  Just once, I d like to know [sneezes]  ...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath.  Beth: What?!  What does Morty s skin smell like?  How soft... [grunts] How soft are his privates?  Beth: Let go of me, davin!  [Glass shatters]  [roars] Take me to Morty.  Jerry: [grunts] You re not Morty.  Jerry: No.  I m mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar.  That s... stupid.  Jerry: [grunting] Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you.  Beth: Jerry! Thank god!  Jerry: God?  God s turning people into insect monsters, Beth.  I m the one beating them to death.  Thank me.  Beth: Thank you, Jerry.  Thank you.  Rick: Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it s all back to normal.  Morty: Just do it already.  Rick: Well, technically, Morty, there s no rush.  I mean, you know, o-once it s fixed, it s done.  It s fixed.  You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit.  I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is.  I mean, Morty, w-w-when s the next time you re gonna see something like this?  I mean, soak it in, you know?  It s it s pretty neat.  It s pretty interesting.  Morty: That s it, Rick!  I m pulling the lever.  [Grunts]  Rick: W-what do we have here, Morty?  Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh?  I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh?  I-i-i bet you feel like the world s smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.  Morty: Oh, Rick, something s not right.  Rick: [sighs] Yeah, you.  You re not right ever.  Morty: No, no!  Look, you idiot!  [All screaming]  [all speaking native language]  [all groaning]  [all ululating]  Rick: Bet you re loving this, Morty.  This must be the best day of your life.  You get to be the mayor of I told you town.  [Slurps]  You re welcome.  [Slurps]  Jerry: Hold on.  Beth: [whimpers]  [engine revs, tires squeal]  [gun cocks]  Jerry: I wish that shotgun was my pen1s.  Beth: If it were, you could call me ernest hemingway.  Jerry: I don t get it, and I don t need to.  [Both moaning]  Summer: Mom! Dad!  Both: Summer!  Beth: [sighs]  Jerry: Where s Morty?  Summer: I don t know.  Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this?  Jerry: It s not fair to assume that, Summer.  Beth: Oh, not fair?  Give me a break.  He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother.  A real man stands by his woman.  [Both moaning]  Summer: Tchoo.  Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo.  Rick: Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn t i?  We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty.  A-at least they re not in love with you anymore, though.  That s a huge step in the right direction.  Morty: Oh, my god!  It s a living nightmare!  How could you be so irresponsible, Rick?  Rick: Me irresponsible?!  You all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty!  You re the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down and make you up a... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school.  I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty?  You re gonna try to take the high road on this one?  Y-y-y-y-you re a little creep, Morty.  Y-you re a you re you re you re just a little creepy... creep person.  Morty: All right, fine.  I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum.  I m willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick.  But I ll tell you something you know what?  You got to accept your part of the blame!  I m not the one who fouled up the serum!  I m not the one who who who who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs!  You got to fix this, Rick!  Morty: All right, all right, Morty.  You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that ll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking.  Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting.  [Birds chirping]  Morty: Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time.  I mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it y-y-you you you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do.  Whoo!  That s some great luck.  Rick: Come on, Morty.  Luck had nothing to do with it.  I m great.  That s the real reason.  Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy?  Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis defibulizer?  Morty: Sure thing, Rick.  Here s a screwdriver.  Rick: All right, Morty.  Thank you very much.  We got one screw turn... and two screw turns... and... all right, Morty, here we are.  Morty: Oh, my god, Rick!  Is that us?!  W-w-w-we re dead!  What is going on, Rick?  I m freaking out!  Rick: Calm down, Morty!  Look at me! Calm down, Morty!  Morty: No, I can t deal with this!  Rick: Calm yourself, Morty.  Morty: I can t deal with this, Rick!  Rick: Calm down, Morty.  Morty: This can t be real!  Rick: You got to calm down, Morty.  Morty: W-w-w-w-we re ripped apart!  Rick: Shut up and listen to me!  It s fine. Everything is fine.  There s an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal.  I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time.  Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine.  We re not skipping a beat, Morty.  Now, help me with these bodies.  Morty: This is insane.  Rick: Look, Morty, I ll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay?  I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.  Morty: Rick, what about the reality we left behind?  Rick: What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty?  The answer is don t think about it.  It s not like we can do this every week, anyways.  We get three or four more of these, tops.  Now, pick up your dead self and come on.  Haste makes waste.  I-i-i don t suppose you ve considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn t screwed up as much as I did, we d be these guys right now, so, again, you re welcome.   266a look on down from the bridge  266a  266a there s still fountains down there  266a  266a look on down from the bridge  266a  266a it s still raining up here  266a  266a everybody seems so far away from me  266a  266a everybody just wants to be free  266a  266a look away from the sky  266a  266a it s no different when you re leaving home  266a  266a I can t be the same thing to you now  266a  266a I m just gone  266a  266a just gone  266a  266a how could I say goodbye?  266a  266a how could I say goodbye?  266a  Summer: You know, the thing about a shark... he s got lifeless eyes... black eyes, like a doll s eyes.

Beth: Sometimes.  But, I m ashamed to admit, now that they re gone, I m finally happy.  Rick: Here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged.  We ll fit right in, cronenberg Morty.  It ll be like we never even left cronenberg world.  Morty: Yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I m gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know?  I mean, i-i wish we hadn t genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around.

Dismissively, Rick concedes.  Back on Earth, the rest of Morty's family is perturbed with his newly sexually active lifestyle with the robot, with Jerry particularly vocal against it since all Morty does is stay in his room with the robot. Beth points out that Morty is undergoing puberty and insists that Jerry not intervene, though remains cautiously open to the idea when Morty calls for Rick's help and her father goes upstairs.  Morty reveals a floating metal ball which he claims is \""Gwendolyn\"" the robot. The rest of the family, alerted by the commotion from Rick trying to secure the ball, witness the metal ball give birth to a infant and turn back into the robot. Inspecting the robot's insides, Rick confirms that the robot was given the ability to give birth and the infant contains half of Morty's DNA, to the shock of Morty and the family. Before he can put down the alien infant, he is stopped by the rest of the family who ask him to let it live, despite his protests. Rick decides to take the robot to the garage and inspect it further while Morty is determined to raise \""Morty Jr.\"" as his own.  As Summer visits the garage, Rick identifies the robot's origin as the planet Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system, and explains that he intends to send Morty Jr. back to his home planet and find suitable parents for him. Summer hints that she wishes to go an adventure with her grandfather like Morty does, but Rick dismisses her, claiming that he doesn't take \""chicks\"" on adventures, which offends Summer. Summer is suddenly seized through the portal Rick opens by male Gazorpians, forcing Rick to follow. Meanwhile, Jerry and Beth both attempt to give Morty parenting advice, but end up disagreeing with their different parenting styles, alluding to their own disappointments with their children. Morty snaps, demanding his parents to back off, instead turning on the television to show Morty Jr. a children's show; both Jerry and Beth agree that Morty will inevitably fail with his parenting.  On Gazorpazorp, Summer is nearly raped by the male Gazorpians until Rick rescues her in time, but the resulting fight destroys his portal gun. Rick attempts repairs on the gun with parts from broken sex robots littered on the planet while Summer is forced to conceal herself in a burqa, disgusted at the backwards, patriarchal state of the planet. She is offended by Rick's suggestion that the male Gazorpians removed their females for efficiency due to their advancement and eventually caused a fallout that knocked them back to their \""Stone Age\"". Just then, a gigantic floating stone head arrives above the male Gazorpians to drop more sex robots, which the males copulate with. Rick and Summer grapple onto one of the robots and enter the stone head, which is revealed to be run by refined female Gazorpians who profess severe distaste for males, forcing Summer and Rick to fake a master-slave relationship.  The female Gazorpians bring Rick and Summer to their underground matriachal utopia, bringing them before their leader Ma-Sha. Ma-Sha reveals that the female Gazorpians chose to separate themselves from the males. To continue their species they created the sex robots and separate the resulting babies by gender; the little girls are educated into their society while the children are evicted onto the planet's surface. When Summer exclaims about the infants being just children, Ma-Sha tells her that Gazorpian males mature within a day and become one of the most violent, aggressive species in the universe. Rick realizes that Morty is in big trouble, as is Earth. Indeed, as Morty Jr. matures from infancy to childhood, Morty is horrified as Morty Jr. expresses desire to cause destruction, murder and mayhem, and insists on keeping Morty Jr. indoors, claiming that the atmosphere outside is poisonous to Morty Jr. However, this causes Morty Jr's relationship with Morty to become strained as when Morty tries to divert Morty Jr's attention to a dance on a children show, he ends up yelling at Morty Jr, causing Morty Jr to cry, something that Jerry and Beth remark \""Nice\"".  Summer explains to Ma-Sha that a male Gazorpian was born on her planet, causing Ma-Sha to question her on the state of gender equality on Earth. This prompting an argument between Rick and Summer about gender roles on Earth, culminating in Rick popping a massive, resounding fart in protest, to the disgust of the female Gazorpians. Upon hearing Summer refer to Rick as \""grandfather\"" and realizing that Summer is the product of male/female reproduction, Ma-Sha orders their arrest. At the same time, Morty Jr. has grown into adolescence, picked up smoking and demands to be allowed to his warlike tendencies after watching documentaries on the History channel. Following an argument with Morty, Morty Jr. runs out of the house; discovering that the air is not poisonous to him, he runs away.  Ma-Sha sentences Summer and Rick to death, revealing after some bickering with Rick that they are to be crushed under a falling boulder. When Rick apologizes to Summer about their impending fate and complements her top, it gives her an idea. Summer protests by pointing out her top which Ma-Sha earlier complimented, which she explains was designed by a male Earthling fashion designer and proves it by showing them the design label. Saying that a fraction of male Earthlings are born gay, Summer explains that while gender separation has worked out well on Gazorpazorp, the same standards would not work on Earth nor would it be fair to enforce female Gazorpian standards on humans. Since the female Gazorpians acknowledge that she is better dressed than them in clothes made by a male, Ma-Sha should release them. Ma-Sha concedes, giving them a spaceship so Summer and Rick can return to their \""weird planet, where women are equal but not really\"".  On Earth, Morty Jr. has begun a rampage following an epiphany backed by music. Driven on Jerry's car, Morty tries to calm Morty Jr. down, which he eventually succeeds in. Morty admits to Morty Jr. that he is an alien and he wasn't a good father, but explains that he really wanted Morty Jr. to channel his destructive nature to creative outlets. Brad Anderson, the creator of the comic strip ''Marmaduke'', agrees as he walks by, revealing that Marmaduke is his creative outlet through which he channels his violent and sexual thoughts. Morty and Morty Jr. share a farewell hug just as Rick and Summer return to Earth, with Rick giving ownership of the Gazorpian spaceship to Summer. Beth asks where Rick has been, and Rick answers her by popping another fart which the whole family laughs at.  Following the credits, Morty Jr. is seen on a television show (watched by everyone in the Smith household) with a talk show host, having matured into a middle-aged man and now the best-selling author of a book titled \""My Horrible Father\"" about his childhood experience. As Morty cringes, the family are stunned to watch and Beth assures her son that parenting is a thankless task and in the end he did the best he could. Downcast, Morty hopes that Jr. is eating enough.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Alien:    Fuck no.     Rick:    Then -- then -- then it s a broken defraculator,     Alien:    Like you would even know dick about fraculation!

I wouldn t even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did, you know?     Rick:    Okay, 60 for the resonator, and my grandson wants the sex robot.  (Intro)     Summer:    So, we re just going to pretend this isn t happening?  I m not saying that s a bad idea -- just asking,     Jerry:     Rick, why would you let Morty bring that thing into our house?!     Rick:    I don t know,  What do you want from me?  He thi-- he thou-- he thou-- he th-- he thought it looked cool,  You know what I mean?     Morty:    Whew!  [ Gulping ]  Ahh, All right,  Back to -- back to -- b-back upstairs,  [ Footsteps depart, door closes in distance ]  [ Rhythmic creaking ]     Jerry:    Well, I m intervening.     Beth:    Intervening with puberty?  You ll turn him into  Ralph Fiennes in \""Red Dragon,\""  He s at that age,  Let s just be proud of him,     Summer:    Jesus, Did I really set the bar that low?     Morty:    Um, Rick, could you come with me, please -- q-quickly?  Beth: Okay, now if we hear squeaking, we intervene,  [ Warbling ]     Rick:     Where s the sex robot, Morty?

Rick:    Hey, listen -- you guys quarantined the house when Summer brought olives back from Mexico,  I mean, this thing could grow to the size of Delaware,  I mean, it might eat brains and exhale space aids,  We got to be careful,  Morty: I lost the chance to be careful, Rick,  I m a father now!  You know, it s time for me to be responsible, Isn t that right,,,     Rick:    Don t name it,     Morty:    ,,,[[Morty Jr.|Morty Jr]] ,?     Rick:    Oh, crap he named it.     Beth:    Well, dad, it s a living thing, and it s half human,     Jerry:     And it was born on American soil, which entitles it to --     Beth:    Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake,  Don t punish us for it.     Rick:    Fine, I m gonna take this thing to my workshop and do a little bit of investigating,  Do not let that thing out of your sight,  It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous,     Jerry:     Like the Insane Clown Posse.     Rick:    Yeah, Good one, Jerry,  2003 just called,  It wants its easy target back,     Morty:    Ohh,  He s like a little me!  Y-you don t think he ll turn into a monster,,,do you?

Jerry:    Life is effort, and I ll stop when I die!  -    Rick:    Out,  -    Summer:    Whatcha doin ?     Rick:    Well, I can t solve the problem my way, thanks to your family s primitive biological hang-ups,  Gross, I might have just touched one of Morty s loads,  But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr, on this robot s home world, which is...  Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system,  - Scoot, Summer,  -    Summer:    Don t you need a new companion now that Morty s in the family way?  Rick: I don t do adventures with chicks, Summer,     Summer   : Oh, right -- because there s something about having a wiener that would make me better at walking through a hole?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!     Rick:    Oh, crap,     Summer:    Grandpa Rick! Ugh!  Help! Help! Aah! Aah!  [ Roars ]     Summer:    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  - Grandpa Rick!  -    Rick:    Still think it s a good idea to go through holes without a wiener?  -    Summer:    I want to go home,  -    Rick:    Yeah, no duh,  Ugh!     Summer:    [ Gasps ]  [ All snarling ]     Rick:    Great, now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs.     Jerry:    You re doing great Morty,     Morty:     Really? You think? I mean,  I m not doing much of anything,  What do I do if it cries?     Beth:    Then you put it down and let it cry itself out,     Jerry:    Yeah, right,  We tried that technique on Summer, and she s gonna end up stripping,  Isn t she? Yes, she is,  She s gonna strip for attention because she was denied it.     Beth:    Stop filling it with your own insecurity,  You re gonna turn it into Morty -- uh, mm -- more -- more -- more -- more of you,     Jerry:    Well, we can t all be raised like reptiles by a mentally ill scientist,  [Morty Jr. belches fire]     Jerry:    What the -- aah! Aah!  [ Crying ]     Beth:    Listen to me,  I am not rewarding this behavior.     Morty:    Knock it off, both of you!  G-give me him!  Give me my baby!  You re both nuts!  I m gonna raise  Morty Jr, myself!   266a Where s your hands?  266a   266a There s your hands  266a   266a And that s how we play handy hands  266a     Jerry:    Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty,     Beth:    At least we can agree on that.  [ All snarling ]  [ Growling ]     Rick:    Thanks, dum-dum,  [ Roars ]     Rick:     I said, \""Thanks, dum-dum,\""  Go get more,  Summer, put your burka on!     Summer:    That burka is a human-rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top,     Rick:    Look, I m trying to repair a p-portal gun with a bunch of sex-doll parts, and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from carting you off,  The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender.     Summer:    Ugh, What s the deal with this place?  Why is it such a sausage planet, and how did such backward idiots invent robots?     Rick:    Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines,  The resultant lack of distraction and hen-pecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age, and now they just fight with each other over fake pussy with sticks and rocks all day long.     Summer:    You think it s efficient to get rid of women?     Rick:    You ever see a line for the men s room?  Are you hear-- do you li-- do you hear me, Summer?  [ Rumbling ]  Droppin  loads,  - All: Droppin  loads!  - Droppin  loads,     Rick:    The plot thickens,  [ All shouting indistinctly ]  Uh, you might want to cover your eyes, Summer,  Summer: Yeah, like it was my dream to watch,  [ All murmuring ]  Yeah, baby!     Rick:     Summer, grab -- grab hold,  Yeah, baby!     Rick:    Aaaah!     Summer:    Grandpa Rick, where are we going?  Rick: Well, obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class,  Sound familiar?     Summer:    [ Gasps ]  Ticketmaster,     Rick:    Oh, there -- there we go, Summer,  Hey -- hey, brother,  Hey, bro,  Nice racket you got going on here,  Listen, I m Rick Sanchez from Earth dimension C-137,  Don t mean you any harm,  Coming in peace,  It s all cool in the, uh --  \""Good in the neighborhood\"" is what I was trying to come -- is what I meant,  Oh, I get it -- the old \""behind-every-great-man  Amazon twist,\""     Gazorpian:    Silence!  Rick: [ Choking ]  [ Coughs ]     Gazorpian:    Your slave is ill-mannered,     Summer:    My slave?     Gazorpian:    We assume you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants,  If he is a rogue male, tell us now  - and we will kill him,  -    Summer:    He s my slave,  He s my slave,  He s definitely my slave.     Rick:    [ Chokes ]  Ugh! Ohh! Oh-ho-ho!  Oh, boy, What s the opposite of \""Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs\""?  Am I right, ladies and gentlemen?  Are you guys kidding me?     Morty:    Oh, Morty Jr,! you re gonna be a special little guy, aren t you?  You -- oh, yeah,  You re my special little guy,  Ohh,  Ohh! Ha ha!     Morty Jr:    Da,  -    Morty:    What was that,  Morty Jr,?  Were you gonna say, \""Dada\""?  - Say, \""Dada,\""     Morty Jr:    Death!     Morty:    \""Dada,\""     Morty Jr:    Damnation!     Morty:    Um,,,\""Dada\""?  Morty Jr: Destruction, Domination,     Jerry:    [ Clears throat ]  Nice.     Gazorpian PA System:    The spider in sector \""C\"" is still alive,  Plan your route accordingly and expect delays,  We re not telling you what to do,  We re just sharing how we feel,  And now weather -- is anyone else cold, or is it just me?     Mar-sha:    I am Mar-sha, ruler of Gazorpazorp,  I am here if you need to talk,     Summer   : What is this place?     Mar-sha:    Paradise.  We built it during the great passive-aggression, when the females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior,  I am here if you need to talk.     Summer:    I am here if you need to talk,     Mar-sha:    From here, we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population,  Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery,  The females are placed into educational programs where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most,  Males....they get to play outside.     Summer:    That was just a baby,  And within a day, he ll be an adult male Gazorpian  -- one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe,     Rick:    Wait a minute, We re here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet,     Summer:    You speak when you re spoken to, ding-a-ling!  It s true, though -- one of your babies was born on earth,  Are you the ruler of this Earth?     Summer:    How did you know?  The quality of your top,  -    Summer:    Do you love it?  - I love it,  - I m here if you need to talk,  - I m here if you need to talk,     Summer:     I m here if you need to talk,  If the Gazorpian is male, your earth is in grave danger,  We will give you passage back home so it can be terminated,  But first, Mojitos,     Rick:     We don t have time for Mojitos,  -   Summer:    You are insulting them,  -    Rick:    I don t care, Summer!  This place is the worst!  I want to go home!     Summer:    Well, it really doesn t matter what you want, because this is a sane place where women rule,     Rick:    Yeah, You know what I have to say about that?  [ Farting ]  [ All gasp ]  I cannot believe my ears!  Rick: [ Farting continues ]  Whoo, boy!  Who let the frogs out, huh?     Summer:    Grandpa!  - Grandpa?  - That sounds patriarchal!  - It means \""Father of fathers,\""  Then this one is not your slave, and your Earth is yet another planet dominated by men,     Rick:    It s not dominated by us, okay?  On Earth, men and women are equals,     Summer:    Equals?! We make 70% of your salary for the same job!  - Seize them!  -    Rick:    Whoa!     Rick:    Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?     Morty Jr:    This is for you, daddy,     Morty:    Oh, man!  Um, okay,  Listen to me, Morty Jr,  I ve got to tell you something very important, okay?  Killing is bad -- bad!  [ Giggles ]     Morty Jr:   You re silly, daddy,     Morty Jr:    No, Morty Jr,  I m being serious, okay?  You need to put your energy into something else,  I mean, what about dancing?  Would you like to learn how to dance?  I d like to dance -- on the graves of my enemies,     Morty:    Ohh!  No, Morty Jr,!     Morty Jr:    Daddy, can I go outside?     Morty:    No! Absolutely not!  But that s where all the people and the animals are,     Morty:    Yeah, but you can t go out there because the -- the air is poisonous for you!  You will die -- you ll die instantly if you ever leave this house!  - You hear me?  - For real?     Morty:     For real times a million, buddy,  So, let s just stay inside, and, you know, let s try dancing, right?  Look at me, Yay! Look,  We re gonna dance, Come on,  Join -- dance with me here,  We love to dance.     Morty Jr:    Why do we love to dance?     Morty:    Because I said so!  [ Crying ]  -    Beth:    Nice,  -    Jerry:    Nice,  [ Indistinct conversations ]  So, what are you in for?     Rick:    Because I got --  I got a big, you know, penis between my legs,  What -- what -- what are you in for?     Gazorpian #2:    The worst crime a female can commit,  Veronica Ann Bennett,  I find you guilty of having bad bangs,  You ever notice the ones with bad bangs always have three names?  You are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment!  [ All gasp ]     Rick   : Pfft!  This is gonna be cake,  No, Jackie!  Rick and Summer of Earth, for the crimes of treason against womankind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist, you are hereby sentenced to --     Rick:    What, what, what -- a night on the couch?  - ,,,death,  -    Rick:    Ooh, gerp,     Summer:    I hate you so much right now.     Gazorpian #2:    This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness, so we are forced to improvise,  We placed a large boulder on that ledge,     Rick:     Holy shit! Y-y-you re gonna crush us with a boulder?!     Gazorpian #2:    No! Stop interrupting!  The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch knives,     Rick:    What? Just give me a gun,  I ll kill myself.     Gazorpian #2:    Stop interrupting!  The knives will -- fine!  You were right the first time, okay? The boulder crushes you,  I just didn t want to admit you were right,  - Happy?  - No, just ignore them,  - Ignore them,  - Such an asshole,     Rick:    Look, I m sorry, Summer,  I feel bad that I let you drag us into this,  I wish I could have been a better grandpa to you, and, you know, for what it s worth, that is a really nice, cute top that you re wearing there,     Summer:    Top, My top!  My top -- the same top you complimented earlier!  Look -- look at the tag,  Read it.     Gazorpian #2:    It says, \""Marc Jacobs,\""  Marc? Jacob?  These are names of the penis,     Summer:    Yes,  An Earth man made this top,  Maybe on your planet, separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on Earth, a certain percentage of our males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours,  A man made something fashionable?  It s true, and sometimes the truth hurts, but it must be accepted, like if I told you that you re using the wrong color foundation for your skin and it ends at your neck, making you look like a party clown.     Summer:    Okay, ouch, Noted,  But the fact remains if you impose  Gazorpazorp s laws on earth, you re no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken,  And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute,  [ All gasp ]  Very well, Give the Earth people a spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet, where women are kind of equal but not really,     Rick:    Good job, Summer, and thanks, girls,  You know, you girls are really something, I ll tell you that,  You know when we first got there, I was like --  Give them a ship now,     Morty:    Morty Jr,!

Morty:    We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts,  We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive,     Morty Jr:    But I want to murder everyone I see!     Morty:    Well, you know,  I mean, maybe there s a job out there for people that feel that way,     Brad Anderson:    Actually, there is,  Hi, I m Brad Anderson, creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip  \""Marmaduke,\""  You should consider being a creative,  I m haunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilations and sexual assaults on a near daily basis,  But, you know, I channel it all into my work.  -    Morty:    Oh, Wow,  -    Morty:    Huh,  I never got that impression from reading \""Marmaduke,\""     Brad Anderson:    Well, did you get the impression  I was trying to make you laugh?     Jerry:    Tell me that wasn t  Brad Anderson?     Morty:    Aw, see?  You hear that, Morty Jr,? maybe you could try being a creative of some kind,     Morty Jr:    Maybe!  I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel,  I mean, what I really want to do is slit people s throats, but beyond that,,,     Morty:    I know you can do it, son,     Morty Jr:    I think it s time I get a place of my own.  I promise I ll call you every day, or if  I need money or a place to do laundry.     Morty Jr:    [ Growling affectionately ]     Morty:    Aaaaaaah!  [ Whoosh! thud! ]  [ Whoosh! thud! ]     Jerry:    So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear axle?     Rick:    Isn t it interesting,  Summer, that after all that stuff we just did, nothing really mattered and there was no point to it?  Kind of makes you wonder, huh -- about nothing?     Summer:    Are you sure it doesn t make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventures?     Rick:    No, I d say, given what we ve been through, that I was right the whole time and any epiphanies about gender politics were a projection of your feminine insecurity,  But, hey, why don t you have a pink spaceship?  Go ride around and have a jolly old time,  Maybe that ll shut you up.     Beth:    Dad? Summer?  Where were you guys this whole time?     Summer:    On Gazorpazorp,  Where were you?     Beth:    I was reading a newspaper,     Rick:    Oh, that s interesting,  Beth,  You know, it s funny,  I-I-I heard about a little bit of news myself,  Take a look,  T-take a listen,  [ Farting ]  [ Both laugh ]  Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs!

[[Rick]] expresses disgust at the quality of television, and [[Jerry]] challenges him to provide anything better. Rick destroys the existing cable box and installs his own: a cable box capable of receiving television across infinite dimensions. The shows featured in these alternate realities vary wildly, such as a Showtime crime show in a reality where people evolved from corn. Rick flips through the channels to show the endless possibilities, before the family sees [[Jerry]] in an episode of David Letterman, in a reality where he was a famous movie star. This excites the rest of the family, and Rick gets annoyed feeling that they are getting obsessed about the wrong things.  Rick pulls out a pair of [[Inter-Dimensional Goggles]] that he throws into the kitchen, in which Jerry, [[Beth]], and [[Summer]] chase after. [[Morty]] says he does not care about himself enough to see what his alternate self would be like, in which Rick congratulates him. The two then watch various commercials and clips from alternate realities.  Meanwhile, Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen taking turns using the goggles. Jerry sees himself doing cocaine with Johnny Depp while Beth sees herself operating on a person instead of a horse. Summer has trouble finding any other realities of her, except for a moment of the family playing [[Yahtzee]]. It's during this time that she first finds out that she was an unwanted pregnancy, and the news upsets her greatly. Seeing her parents achieve their dreams in realities where she was not born, she tells them that she is running away.  The alternate realities of their lives shake Jerry and Beth to the core, and they decide that maybe it'd be better to spend time apart. Summer goes upstairs and begins to pack, and Morty attempts to console her. She attempts to push him away before he points outside to the graves in the backyard (from the episode \""[[Rick Potion No. 9]]\""). He reveals the truth that he is not, in fact, her brother but a brother from another reality. Morty tells Summer \""Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody is going to die....Come watch TV?\""  Beth keeps the goggles on while laying on the floor of the kitchen, enjoying her alternate life. The television in the main room shows [[Jerry Smith (C-500A)|alternate reality Jerry]] having a drug-induced breakdown, stripped down to his underwear, his head half-shaven, and driving a mobility scooter on a freeway with droves of police cars behind him. Rick almost changes the channel, but Jerry yells at him to keep it. They watch as alternate reality Jerry arrives at the doorstep of an alternate reality Beth, telling her that he hated his life and regretted not continuing their relationship. Beth and Jerry are stunned, as they run to each other to embrace.  In the post-credit sequence, the Smith family is watching the news in a Hamster-in-Butt World. The family asks Rick a wide variety of questions about the world until he begrudgingly creates a portal to the world so they can 'ask them yourselves.' Jerry excitedly calls it a family vacation and the Smith family spend a vacation in Hamster-In-Butt World where a photo montage show them all having a good time (even Rick at the end).",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Summer   : Why would he choose Veronica?     Jerry   : Because he   loves   her?     Rick   : Well if it s any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid.

Jerry   : No, the   other   thing! Go back!     Rick   :   Really  ? All right, fine. [  backs up two channels  ]     Woman (on TV)   : Glenn, this is a   court order  .

Shmlony (on TV)   : Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan--     Rick   : All right, that got, that actually got old pretty quick.     Jerry   : [  groans  ] Rick, would you   please   go back to me on David Letterman?     Rick    [  flipping quickly through multiple channels, including another Jerry channel  ]: Infinity s a big number, Jerry. I don t remember the channel.     Beth   : Go back, go back!     Rick   : Jeez. [  changes channel back to Cloud Atlas riff  ]     Jerry (on TV)   : You speak da tru-tru.     Summer   : Oh my God! Dad s in \""Cloud Atlas\""!     Jerry   : I m in \""Cloud Atlas\""!

[  puts gun in mouth, firing it once offscreen  ]     Host in Trenchcoat (on TV)   : Wow, that one was   really   quick, wasn t it?     Rick   : Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions, a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?     Beth, Summer, and Jerry    [  all at once]  : Narcissism. The narcisstic stuff. I want to obsess about myself.     Rick   : [  sighs  ] Here. [  stands, pulling an ocular device from his coat  ] These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes.  [  throws the device into the kitchen  ] Go fetch!  [  Jerry, Summer, and Beth run to the kitchen  ]     Beth and Summer:    [  at the same time  ] Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First!

And there s so many TVs, microwaves, radios I think, I can t-- I m not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can t see anything. Our prices, I hope, aren t too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That s fair! I m Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson!   Everything s   black, I can t see a thing! [  set on fire  ] And also I can t feel anything either-- did I mention that? But that s not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can t feel. It s a very rare disease. All my-- All my nerves, they don t allow for the sensation of touch. So I   never   know what s going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don t know.    Int. Smith Residence. Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen with the Ocular Device.        Beth   : Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?     Jerry:    You re right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee-- [  grabs the device  ] Give me those! [  turns switch  ]     Beth:    What do you see?     Jerry:    Whiteness... Pure whiteness.     Johnny Depp (on Device):    You re my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you.     Jerry:    Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp!     Beth:    [  sighs, taking the device  ] Haven t we spent enough time on   you  ? [  turns switch  ] I m performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a   human  !     Jerry:    That s great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon.     Beth:    [  taking off device  ] I   am   a real surgeon.     Jerry:    Ahh, uh-- Summer s turn! [  giving Summer the device  ]     Summer:    Finally! I don t see anything.     Beth:    Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there s a chance you weren t even born-- That came out   wrong  , that came out      very    wrong  .     Summer:      Fine  , I ll find a world where you bothered to   have   me. [  turns switch a few times  ] We re playing Yahtzee.     Beth:    Yahtzee s fun. We love Yahtzee.     Jerry:    It s a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second?    Int. Smith Residence. Rick and Morty are sitting in the living room watching TV.       Announcer (on TV):    It s a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it s the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D. It s the brand-new Sneezy XL. The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise. [  car sneezes  ] It s polite, it s right, and it s Sneezy Deezy Mc-fucking Deluxe.     Mr. Sneezy 3D (on TV):    Oh, I m Mr. Sneezy! Achoo!     Morty:    Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.     Rick:    Yeah, it s got an almost improvisational tone. [  changes channel  ]     Announcer (on TV):    It s in theaters now! Coming this summer: Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came. And   that s   when things got knocked into   12th gear.    A Mexican armada shows up. With weapons made from Two--tomatoes. And you better   bet your bottom dollar   that these two brothers know how to   handle   business. In: Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers, Who Are Just Regular Brothers, Running In a Van From an Asteroid and All Sorts of Things THE MOVIE!  Hold on, there s more! Old women are coming, and they re also in the movie, and they re gonna come, and cross-attack these two brothers. But let s get back to the brothers, because they re-- they have a   strong bond  . You don t want to know about it here, but I ll tell you one thing: The   moon,   it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then? It s two brothers and--and th-they re - It s called Two Brothers. Two brothers! [  starts laughing  ] It s just called Two Brothers.    Int. Smith Residence. Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen with the Ocular Device.        Beth:    Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize.     Jerry:    [  taking the device  ] Come on! Time s up! [  turns switch  ] I m taming a lion! No, wait, uhh there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie. [  gives Summer the device  ] You get the idea. I work with lions.     Summer:    [  turning switch  ] [  dryly  ]   Ooh  , we re not playing Yahtzee, [  shoves device into Jerry s hands  ] we re playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when   I   exist, life gets a little more, I don t know,   predictable  ?     Beth:    When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals.     Jerry:    Gimme a break! We re not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night.     Beth:    Oh,   I   get it. Now that you know you could have had it better,   you   resent   me   for holding   you   back.     Jerry:    Well now that we know you think the tables are turning,   we   know   you   thought there were unturned tables!     Beth:    [  scoffs  ] What are you talking about?     Jerry:    All this time, you ve been thinking, \""What if that loser Jerry hadn t talked me out of the abortion?\""     Summer:    Um--     Jerry:    Well now you know: you d be a doctor. [  circles finger  ] Whoop-dee-doo. You d also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I d be on DiCaprio s yacht-- [  holds up device  ]   banging   Kristen Stewart!     Summer:    You thought about getting an   abortion  ?     Beth:    Everyone   thinks   about it. Obviously,   I m   the version of me that didn t do it. So you re welcome.     Jerry:    Yeah, you re welcome.     Summer:    Yeah, thank you guys   so   much. It s a   real   treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy.     Rick:    [  walking to the cupboard  ] Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? [  grabs cookie box. eats cooke and starts walking away  ] Mm! [  stops and looks back at Jerry, Summer and Beth  ] Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don t have it as good, huh? That s too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called \""Ball Fondlers\"". I mean, I don t want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse. [  eats another cookie, walking offscreen  ]    Int. Smith Residence. Rick and Morty are sitting in the living room watching the action-packed title sequence to  201cBall Fondlers 201d.       Rick:    I m in heaven right now. [  eating wafer cookies  ]     Morty:    This might be the best day of my life.    Int. Smith Residence. Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen.        Beth:    So now what do we do?     Jerry:    That show \""Ball Fondlers\"" sounded kind of interesting.     Summer:      Dad!       Jerry:    What? They re having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they re together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we re not.     Summer:    Well, I m leaving!     Beth:    You can t leave, you re   17  !     Summer:    Yeah, and I m   not   pregnant. I m gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age. I m gonna... move to the southwest and-- I don t know, do something with turquoise. [  walks offscreen  ]    Int. Smith Residence. Rick and Morty are sitting in the living room watching TV.    [  Summer storms off, passing in from of the TV  ]     Announcer (on TV  ):      It s Saturday Night Live! Starring A Piece of Toast! Two guys with handle-bar mustaches! A man painted silver who makes robot noises! Garmanarnar! Three s-- uh uh, uh, uh, I ll get back to that one.

Rick:    No, Morty, it s Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he s still alive.     Morty:    Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music?     Rick:    Yeah, I m pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters, which is really strange, because it s the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp-- or Garfield, I mean.     Morty:    Yeah, that s pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too?

[[Rick]] creates a small robot purely to pass the butter on the table when [[Morty]] comes into the kitchen to ask Rick to help him on his science project. [[Jerry]] jumps at the opportunity to work on a project with Morty due to his low self-confidence about his intelligence. Morty decides to agree. [[Summer]] asks for a ride to her job, which is defaulted to Rick since Jerry is 'busy'.  Rick gives Summer a ride to her job, which is helping out an eccentric old man run a 'vintage thrift store' called [[Needful Things]]. The shop is run by [[Mr. Needful]], and has just opened recently. Before Rick and Summer arrive, [[Mr. Goldenfold]] arrives by accident (thinking the shop was a Jamba Juice). Mr. Needful knows his name without introduction and gives him an [[M Shave's Aftershave|aftershave]] to help capture female attention. The aftershave is free, but Mr. Needful states \""Nobody ever pays here...not with money\"".  Summer and Rick arrive into the shop, and Rick is immediately suspicious of Mr. Needful, asking whether he is the devil. This accusation startles Mr. Needful who quickly tries to give Rick a microscope, which Rick reluctantly takes as Summer pushes him out the door. Meanwhile, Jerry and Morty begin to work on a solar system model for his science project. Jerry states that Pluto is a planet and Morty attempts to correct him. However, Jerry refuses to say that Pluto is not a planet.  Morty visits Rick in his garage, where Rick scans the microscope and finds that using it would have significantly lowered his IQ. Jerry barges in assuming Morty is asking Rick about whether Pluto is a planet or not. Jerry vehemently argues that if it was once a planet, it could be a planet again. Mr. Goldenfold returns to Needful Things, saying that the aftershave worked but made him impotent. After Rick arrives and administers a cure into Goldenfold, he reveals that he has invented a device to identify the negative effects of the cursed items. Rick goes around the store, scanning all the items and revealing their curses which scares away the customer base. Mr. Needful and Rick briefly fight before Summer pushes Rick out the door.  Jerry attempts to call NASA to argue about Pluto's planetary status. However, the two are quickly abducted by an alien ship and taken to Pluto, where they meet King Flippynips, the ruler of Pluto. The king is overjoyed that Jerry believes Pluto is a planet, and Jerry becomes a spokesperson to the population, assuring them that they are still a planet. The large cheering crowd quickly inflates Jerry's ego.  Needful Things begins to sell a variety of items, but Summer and Mr. Needful discover it's because Rick has opened another shop across the street called [[Curse Purge Plus!]]. The shop removes the curses for a fee, and is an instant hit. This causes a strain on Mr. Needful's confidence and he attempts to kill himself, but is saved by Summer. Summer arrives into Rick's shop to concede defeat, which results in Rick getting bored and burning the shop to the ground.  Jerry becomes famous to the Pluto population, appearing in various events to advocate that Pluto is a planet. Morty meets [[Scroopy Noopers]], a Plutonian scientist who reveals that major corporations are mining plutonium from Pluto's core, thus making the planet shrink and slowly die. Jerry's opinions fall into line with these corporations, who are desperate to keep the public uninformed about the problems. Morty's attempts to persuade his father to tell the populace the truth falls on deaf ears. It's only when King Flippynips captures Scroopy Noopers and reveals he's his son does Jerry work the courage to tell the population of Pluto their problems.  Mr. Needful opens a new business in the technology realm, opening n33dful.com to ravenous reviews. As he congratulates the workforce, he orders security on them and quickly fires Summer who feels betrayed. She reaches out to Rick who offers an idea. The two lift weights, take steroids and become incredibly muscular and ambush Mr. Needful at a tech talk before celebrating together.  In the after credits sequence, the muscular Rick and Summer beat up various mean-spirited people.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Jerry is immensely excited to reenact moments from the movie, while Beth is hesitant and overall uninterested. In Beth and Jerry's absence, Beth orders [[Rick]], [[Morty]], and [[Summer]] not to trash the house while they are gone and she threatens to put an end to Rick and Morty's adventures if they do. The trio agree as Beth and Jerry drive off. Summer ignores the warnings and attempts to throw a party to become popular. Rick declines due to his plans to throw a party of his own.  Beth and Jerry arrive at Titanic 2, which is a replica of the ill fated ship the RMS Titanic. Jerry sees the line to reenact the famous bow scene from the movie and tries to bring Beth along. Beth blows off his request, and shoves a nearby maid [[Lucy]] to join him instead. The two bond quickly over a mutual love for the Titanic. Meanwhile, the party at the Smith Residence begins. Some of the party-goers include [[Glip Glops]], [[Brad]], [[Bird Person]], [[Revolio Clockberg Jr.|Gear Head]], [[Squanchy]] and many more. The party begins to amp up and Morty confronts Rick about their decisions. [[Jessica]] appears, and Morty shifts his attention to talking to her. Jerry and Lucy continue to enjoy themselves on the ship, but the planned sinking of the ship goes wrong, and the ship doesn't sink due to technical difficulties. Rick's party is getting crazier, Summer blows off a friend of hers named [[Nancy]], which draws criticism from Rick. [[Abrodolph Lincoler]] then smashes through a wall. He gets into a brief altercation with [[Brad]] who promptly beats him up. Jessica is upset and runs outside, and Morty joins her to console her. While showing her various gadgets in the garage, he walks in on Squanchy masturbating (or \""squanching,\"" as he calls it) in a closet, and in the process accidentally knocks over a contraption that teleports the entire house into a weird planet. After Rick takes a look outside, he lets the party-goers know that everything is fine.  Morty begins to freak out about the repercussions of his actions. Rick calms him down and tells him to collect some [[Collaxion Crystals]], which would ostensibly be used to take them back home. Rick convinces [[Abrodolph Lincoler]] to join Morty, and Summer talks [[Nancy]] into joining them as well. The three set out to find the crystals. On the Titanic 2, Lucy finds Jerry and takes him to a storage room where she quickly strips naked and asks him to draw her. Meanwhile, Morty, Nancy, and Lincoler find the crystals but are attacked by a two-headed beast. Lincoler fends off the beast whilst Morty and Nancy collect the crystals. He is mortally wounded whilst defending them. The remainder of the group return to the party and give the crystals to Rick who promptly crushes them up and snorts them. Rick's eyes turn blue, as he gets high, and he starts a rave called the \""Rick Dance\"" along with other party-goers. Rick admits that he can take them back whenever he wanted. Morty, furious after being lied to, throws the rest of the crystals outside. Meanwhile, Jerry attempts to break away from Lucy on the Titanic 2, but she pulls a gun on him and threatens him. She forces him to a prop car, where she attempts to force herself onto him. Beth arrives just in time, and knocks Lucy out with a book. Beth and Jerry pack up their car to leave and Lucy attaches herself to the underside of the car. She holds on briefly before falling and being run over, presumably killing her. Meanwhile, Morty ends the party and forces everyone out. The Smith House is in total shambles, and the cleanup effort begins. Morty is still immensely upset at Rick, but a conversation with [[Bird Person]] reveals to him that Rick is masking a great deal of inner pain, and shows Morty that if he truly wants to stop dealing with his grandfather, he should just leave the place destroyed. At first, Morty agrees that this might be the best thing that ever happened to him because  will be free of Rick forever. Birdperson then teaches him another saying that means \""Whatever lets you sleep at night.\""  Beth and Jerry arrive home, and Birdperson tells him to make his decision as he leaves with Tammy. Morty realizes he does want to continue on his adventures with Rick and  pleads with him to do something about the state of the house before his parents walk through the front door. Rick uses a device that completely freezes time for everyone but them, allowing them an infinite amount of time to clean up the house and prevent Beth and Jerry from knowing the house was ever messy.","(Screen plays the outside of the Smith family s house. Jerry is seen packing stuff into the back of a car that is parked in front of the garage, while Beth is standing by the passenger seat side of the car. Rick, Summer, and Morty are standing by the garage door.)     Summer:    Bye, mom! Bye, dad!     Morty:    Drive carefully!     Rick:    Have fun, you two.     Beth:    Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our... (Sarcastic and moody) Titanic-themed getaway.     Jerry:    (Finishes packing the car, and closes the door of the car.) Let s lose the  tude, please. It s supposed to be romantic. (Opens the passenger seat door.)     Beth:    Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here.     Rick:    I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I (belching) have some synthetic laser-eels oxidizing in the garage.     Beth:    (Angry) Hey, don t blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty. (Opens the car door off screen.)     Morty:    Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom s the one who s saying it, then you know it s pretty serious this time.     Beth and Jerry in unison:    That s right.     Jerry:    Wait... What?     Rick:    Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything s gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It s like that old song \""blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop\"". You guys know that song? (Elbows Morty.) From Tiny Roger s? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the  50s?  (Everyone is silent)     Rick:    No-nobody? (Angry) A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip.     Jerry:    (Serious) Not one thing out of place.  (Beth and Jerry enter the car and drive out of the garage driveway. Jerry then stops the car, and opens the car door.)     Jerry:    Not a single thing.  (Jerry closes the door, and they drive away.)  (A few seconds after the car leaves, the garage door disintegrates, as the synthetic laser eels screech and float out of the damaged garage door. Rick, Morty, and Summer watch the eel s float away, and the garage door collapses onto the three. The giant hole in the door keeps them from being squashed.)      Summer:    (Happy) Well, we re past the point of no return. I m going to have a party.  (Intro plays)  (Screen cuts back to the outside of the Smith family s house. Everyone is in the house, and the garage door was put back into it s original place. There is still a massive burned hole in the door.)     Summer:    (Off screen) I found Jello.  (Screen cuts to a shelf with snacks, as Summer grabs a box of crackers. She is taking to someone on her phone.)      Summer:    Can you sneak your mom s vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room. (Grabs another box) Listen, you can t both be in denial about it. Okay, bye. (Stops the call)  (Morty enters the kitchen, angry.)     Morty   : Summer, you can t throw a party! Remember what mom said?  (Screen changes to a view of the whole kitchen. Rick walks up to the fridge.)     Summer:    Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I m only a human being, Morty.  (Rick is seen searching through the fridge.)     Morty   : Rick, tell Summer she can t have a party!     Rick:    (Pulls out a tray with canapes on it, and places it on the bench off screen.) Uh, Summer, you can t have a party.     Summer:    Ugh.     Rick:    (Back on screen.) Because (burp) I m having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! (burp)     Morty:    Oh, what?! Rick, you can t!     Summer:    What do you mean you re having a party? (Sarcastic) Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?     Rick:    \""Glip glop?\""  You re lucky a Traflorkian doesn t hear you say that.     Summer:    Is that like their n-word?     Rick:    It s like the n-word and the c-word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. (Drinks from a soda can.)     Morty:    Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and --      Summer:    (Interrupts Morty) screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids.     Rick:    That s why you party? Boy, you really are 17.     Summer:    Why do you party?     Rick:    To get (burp) wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!     Summer:    Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones.     Rick:    Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes. (Places a piece of food into his canapes to finish preparing them.)  (Screen cuts to the Titanic getaway. The boat is seen floating on the water, and people are waiting on the sidewalk.)  (Screen cuts again to the left side of the boat, as people are seen getting a tour of the boat. Beth and Jerry are also seen on the group of poeple. workers are seen painting a giant board of a sunset just next to the boat.)     Tour Guide:    After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths.     Jerry:    A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink?     Tour Guide:    I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable.  (The group of people applaud.)     Jerry:    (Notices the front of the Titanic, full of people.) Ooh! Look, it s the line for the bow!     Beth:    (Bored and unimpressed) Jerry, I d love to just kick back with a Margarita and read.   (Both walk down some stairs to the front of the boat towards the line of people.)     Beth:    Do you mind if I skip the whole \""king of the world\"" bit?     Jerry:    Well, it s not the \""king of the world\"" bit. That s Jack and fabrizio. (Grabs Beth s hat and places it on her head.) This is where rose says, \""I m flying, Jack!\"" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone.     Beth:    (Looks to her right, and smiles.) Well, what about her?  (A maid is seen mopping up the deck near the two.)     Beth:    Excuse me, ma am. Would you like to take my place in line?     Lucy   : (Shy) I, uh -- I could get into trouble.     Beth:    (Takes off her hat and places it onto Lucy s.) We won t tell.  (Beth lets Lucy go in the line next to Jerry, and walks away, reading a book.)     Jerry:    So... You re a Titanic fanatic?     Lucy   : Oh, yes. I ve worked here since it opened, but I ve never been able to participate.     Jerry   : Happy to help... rose.  (They both smile as Lucy grabs Jerry s arm, and they both walk down the line. Lucy giggles.)  (Screen cuts to the Smith family s living room. There are a few people chilling out and eating snacks.)     Tammy:    (To a girl) I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don t know if I personally would ever do it...  (The doorbell rings, and Summer walks over to the door and opens it.)     Summer:    Brad! Hey!     Brad:    Yo.  (Brad walks into the house with a few other guys.)     Tammy:    (To the girl) Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk.  (The girl messes up Tammy s hair. Tammy poses as if she s drunk as Brad and the other guys walk past   them.)     Brad:    Check it out. Tammy s already drunk. Cool.  (Summer watches as the guys walk away. As she goes to close the door, a man who is half bird and half human stops the door. Summer opens the door again.)     Birdperson:    The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?     Summer:    Ugh! Grandpa!  (Rick walks up to Birdperson, happy to see him. They fistbump. Summer walks away, grumpy.)     Rick:    Birdperson!     Birdperson:    I am pleased there is no emergency.     Rick:    Oh, there s an emergency, all right. (He puts his arm around Birdperson) A pussy emergency! When s the last time you got laid,  pers?     Birdperson:    It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.     Rick   : Then it s time to get your beak wet tonight, playah. (Leads Birdperson into the house) Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson.  (Morty walks up to Rick.)     Morty:    Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?     Rick:    Uh... people? Mm, six.  (A big green spaceship/UFO lands in front of the house. A bunch of happy little green lumpy aliens come running out of the ship/UFO into the house.)     Rick:    Yo! What up, my glip glops?!     Morty:    Oh, man!  (Screen cuts to the outside of the house. It s nighttime, and people and aliens are seen walking around outside. Two Rick s from the Citadel of Ricks arrive through a portal.)      Morty:    (Walking around picking up trash from the ground and putting it in a garbage bag. The house is very crowded) (Huff) (Huff) Oh! Y-y-you know there s a garbage, right?  (An alien is seen falling off the ceiling.)  (Morty hears a noise, and goes to investigate. He walks into a room to find a red crocodile-like creature mauling up and eating a bird creature. Other people and creatures are just watching.)     Morty   : Hey, uh, what the hell?!     Jelly-like creature with items stuck inside of it:    Ooh. That s why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party. (Exits the room)  (Morty is furious. But he hears a creaking noise coming from upstairs. He goes and checks it out. He walks into his parent bedroom to see two people or aliens, presumably having sex in their bed under the covers.)     Morty:    Oh, oh, g-- oh, that s disgusting! You guys are in my parents  bed!  (The covers are lowered to show a blue alien creature with a giant growth on it. It jiggles when he moves.)     Blue alien:    Oh. Sorry. I m not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit.     Morty   : Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha.  (The blue alien pukes on the side of the bed. It disintegrates a giant patch of the mattress.)     Morty:    Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!  (The screen cuts to the corner of the kitchen. The traflorkians are seen pouring themselves drinks with a beer dispenser. Rick is also there, listening to a half human and half robot person talking to him. Rick is bored out of his mind.)      Gearhead:    The thing people don t realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.     Rick:    Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally.  (Morty walks up to Rick, stressed out.)     Morty:    Rick, you got to stop --  (Rick interrupts Morty, and grabs him.)     Rick:    Morty! Have you met Gearhead?     Morty:    (Waves) Hey, how s it --     Rick:    (Interrupts Morty) Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars. (Rick quickly leaves them)     Gearhead:    How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly?     Morty:    Uh... Not at all.     Gearhead:    Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago...  (Screen cuts to the outside of the house again. People are seen drunk, some people are still arriving, and there is toilet paper hanging off the roof of the house. A big alien structure is seen on the roof, and one lands just in front of the house. A bunch of cyborg robots exit it and march up to the house.)  (The screen cuts back into the house living room. Rick is by the couch with a large red crab creature. Morty walks up to Rick.)     Rick:    Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon?     Morty:    Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!  (A beer bottle is seen smashing into a wall, making a mess.)     Rick:    Whoa, Morty, this guy s entire planet was destroyed.  (Scropon walks away, moping.)     Rick:    Have a little perspective.  (A cat creature walks up to Rick from behind Morty. He s holding some alcohol.)     Squanchy:    Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!     Rick:    Aw! Squanchy!     Squanchy:    Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?     Rick:    Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg!     Squanchy:    All right! I like your squanch! (He runs away, excited)     Morty:    Uh, Rick, what exactly is \""squanching\""?     Rick:    Morty, listen -- we ve had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it s time to relax.     Morty:    Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!     Rick:    Jesus, Morty, you re bumming me out. Can t we just pretend like everything s fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?     Morty:    Yeah, that s easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what s in this for me?  (Time slows down as Jessica dreamily walks into the living room, whipping her hair. People are seen watching her in awe, and a beer bottle is seen being thrown past her.)     Morty:    (In slow motion) Jessica.  (Time goes back to normal.)     Rick:    Knock it off, Slow Mobius!  (A person/alien wearing yellow clothes and is holding magical wands with clocks on the ends is seen stirring up time with his magic.)     Slow Mobius:    Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I m just trying to show off my powers, bro!  (Jessica walks into a different room.)     Morty:    I can t believe she s here.     Rick:    Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her. (He shoves Morty away. Morty follows Jessica.)     Rick:    Tonight, the only adventure you re on is your cusping manhood.  (The scene cuts to the titanic. Jerry and Lucy are running together, laughing. They run past a smoking man. Jerry steals his cigarette, and gets rid of it.)     Jerry:    Oh, Rose.  (Jerry and Lucy both spin dance together.)     Lucy:    Whee!  (Both laughing, as they both look over the balcony at the front of the boat.)     Jerry:    Is that what I think it is?  (Screen cuts to the front of the boat, with workers who are stacking painted boards of pieces of the Titanic.)     Lucy:    (Off screen) Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack s drowning at the end of the movie.  (Screen cuts back to Jerry and Lucy.)     Lucy:    It s so romantic.     Jerry:    I can t wait to do that with Beth.     Lucy:    I don t know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested.     Jerry:    (Gasp!) Look! (Points at the iceberg in front of the boat, as it rises higher out of the water)     Voice through speaker:    Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed.   (Everybody gathers up to the balcony of the boat, watching excitedly.)     Voice through speaker:    Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed.  (Screen cuts to the bridge of the boat. The two captains watch.)     Captain #1:    (Worried) Uh, sir? There s   not   a problem.     Captain #2:    What do you mean there s   not   a problem?  (The control panel s light are flashing red, and beeping.)     Captain #1:    The guidance system isn t putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!     Captain #2:    Well, do something! Steer into it!     Captain #1: (   Frantically trying to steer towards the iceberg) I m trying!  (The boat completely misses the iceberg.)     Captain #2:    It s too late. (Removes his hat, and speaks into a microphone.) Ladies and gentlemen... Don t brace yourselves.  (Everyone on the boat gasp, as they watch the iceberg go past them.)     Jerry:    No! What happened?!     Lucy:    Their rail system must have failed.     Passengers:    Oh, my God! We re not gonna sink! What are we gonna do?!  (Screen cuts to the Smith family s house party. A group of fish creatures are seen swimming and jumping into a pool of yellow liquid. But the screen zooms out to show that it turned out to be a cup full of alcohol. A guy picks the cup up.)     Guy:    Totally gonna get laid tonight. (Drinks from the cup.)  (Tammy is seen swooning over Birdperson. She is petting his feathers.)     Tammy:    (In awe) I like your feathers.     Birdperson:    They are designed to attract the attention of the female.     Tammy:    It s working.     Birdperson:    Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate.     Tammy:    I m not looking to get into a soul bond. I m just looking for... (Whispers into Birdperson s ear.)     Birdperson:    I believe birdperson can arrange that.  (Screen pans to Summer talking to her friends. A girl with glasses walks over to her.)     Nancy:    Hey, Summer, haven t seen you at flute practice in a while.     Girl:    Summer, don t tell me you re friends with her.     Summer:    (Lying) Are you kidding me? I don t even know what she s doing here.  (Rick walks up to Summer.)     Rick:    Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party. (He accidentally splashes some of his drink into Nancy s face.) Everybody should be welcome.  (The wall gets demolished along with a loud explosion. The dust fades, to show a mix between Abradolph Linkler and Adolf Hitler. The house is silent, as he goes around getting aggressive to people.)     Rick:    Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? (Tries to hide his face from Abradolph Lincoler.)     Summer:    I thought everyone was welcome.     Rick:    It s not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out (burp)  it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.  (People run away from Abradolph Lincoler, before he finds Rick.)     Abradolph Lincoler:    Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being.  (Rick is drinking his alcohol, unimpressed.)     Abradolph Lincoler:    (Walks closer to Rick)       But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! (He accidentally bumps Brad with his arm. Brad is standing next to Jessica and Morty)     Brad:    Whoa. What s up, man?     Abradolph Lincoler:    I have no quarrel with you, boy.     Brad:    \""Boy\""? What s that supposed to mean? (Gets up into Abradolph Lincoler s face)     Abradolph Lincoler: (Threatened)    It s just -- l-look, I-I don t know how you thought I meant it, but... (Looks at Rick for help)     Rick:    Don t look at me, dude.     Abradolph Lincoler:    Look, I m half-Abraham Lincoln, so --     Brad:    (Angry) So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!     Abradolph Lincoler:    Well, no, but... You know?     Brad:    What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?     Jessica:    Leave him alone, Brad.     Brad:    Stay out of this, Jessica!  Rick: Kick his ass, Brad! (chanting)      Everyone except Morty and Jessica:    (Chanting) Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass!  (Everyone chants, as Brad beats up Abradolph Lincoler.)     Jessica:    Brad!   (Jessica leaves the living room, as Morty follows her. Rick follows after Morty.)     Morty:    Rick!     Rick:    (Shoves Morty towards the door where jessica went) I just did you a favor, Morty.  (Screen cuts to the steps of the front door. Jessica is sitting alone in the messy front yard. The Morty exits through the door.)     Morty:    Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends.  (A roll of toilet paper falls off the roof, leaving a trail of toilet paper. Morty sits next to Jessica.)     Jessica:    (Annoyed) Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He s always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.     Morty:    Jessica, can I show you something?  (Screen cuts to Morty opening the door to Rick s garage, and switching on the light. Jessica is with morty. The garage is full of constructed devices and stuff.     Jessica:    Wow! Look at all this stuff.     Morty:    (Walks over to the shelves and picks up a circular device.) Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick s Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out.  (Morty presses a button on the device, and it projects holograms of the universe and the planets.)     Jessica:    It s beautiful.     Morty:    You know, Jessica, there s something I ve always wanted to tell you.     Jesica:    What s that, Morty?     Morty:    I think that you re the most --  Jessica: No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there. (Points at the shaking closet.)  (Morty turns off the device, and hands it to Jessica, as he goes to investigate the closet. He walks over to it, hesitant to open it. He glances at Jessica, before opening it. Inside is Squanchy, Autoerotic asphyxiating himself. (Choking himself with a rope while masturbating.     Jessica:    Aah!      Morty:    Oh, my God!     Squanchy:    Hey, I m squanching in here!     Morty:    Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!  (Morty covers his eyes and backs away, accidentally bumping into a large and tall device, knocking it over.)     Morty:    Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!  (The glass on the top of the device shatters, as it flashes a bright green light.)  (The screen cuts to the outside of the house, as the green light surrounds the whole house, and it disappears. It leaves a giant hole where the house was.)  (The house teleports into a colorful alien dimension. Everyone shouts in fear due to the impact of the house landing into the ground.)  (The screen cuts to the living room. Everyone is silent, as the power turns back on. Rick turns to look outside the screen door, and opens it. He watches the giant aliens crawl around.)  Rick: Huh. Big star in the sky. (Breathes in) Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. (Turns around, excited) We ll be fine! Let s party!  (A random guy with his t-shirt in hand swings it over his head in excitement. He yells out, as he runs outside, only to be grabbed by an alien and stuffed into it s hole. Most likely it s genitals. Everyone is silent and concerned, so Rick quickly turns on a stereo.)      Stereo:     266a Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got  266a  (Everyone cheers and dances with Rick.)  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (Scene cuts back to the outside of the house. Rick, Summer, and Morty are outside the screen door. Rick is holding a device and scanning for something. Everyone is still partying inside.)     Summer:    I swear to God, Morty, if it weren t for the fact that everyone s still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now.     Rick:    Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. (Sips from his drink)     Morty:    How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I m losing it here, Rick!     Rick:    (Holds Morty to get his attention) Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax! (Lets go) It s gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals. (Rick is still scanning with his device. It suddenly starts to beep.) Oh, shit, motherfucker! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here.     Morty:    Okay. Let s go, then.  (Morty grabs Rick s arm and tries to pull him. Rick gets back up, but he won t follow morty.)     Morty:    W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick.     Rick:    (Makes Morty let go) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can t go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?     Summer:    Yeah. Me too. I should stay.  (Nancy and Abradolph Lincoler open the screen door and walk through. Abradolph Lincoler is holding a cold soda can up to the side of his face.)     Abradolph Lincoler:    You guys have any aspirin?     Rick:    Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you.     Abradolph Lincoler:    Hey, man, I m not going anywhere. I m injured.     Rick:    Shut up, Lincoler. (Shoves him away) It s the least you can do for wrecking the living room.  (Abradolph Lincoler walks away from the house, as Morty follows.)     Summer:    (Grabs Nancy s shoulders) Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too.     Nancy:    What? Why -- why me?     Summer:    Because, uh, you re -- you re so good at playing the flute. (Shoves Nancy towards Morty and Abradolph Lincoler)  (Rick and Summer glance at each other, and enter the house.)  (Screen cuts back to the Titanic. Workers are seen moving the iceberg away, and cleaning up outside.)  (Screen cuts to the inside of the ship. Everyone is at the  customer service.  Icluding Beth and Jerry.)     Captain #2:    Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings. (He hands Beth a small card.)     Jerry:    (Annoyed) Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken.     Beth:    (Sigh) I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. (Walks away from Jerry)     Jerry:    But -- but --  (Lucy walks up To Jerry.)     Lucy:    You see, Jerry? (She puts her hand on Jerry s shoulder) May I show you something?  (Screen cuts to the storage area of the ship. Lucy and Jerry enter it. It s stocked full of boxes, nets and barrels.)   Lucy: Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater.     Jerry:    I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a \""Titanic\"" failure. (Turns to face Lucy) Get it?  (Lucy removes her dress, exposing her naked body.)     Jerry:    (Shocked and confused) Ooh!     Lucy:    Draw me, Jerry.     Jerry: (Awkwardly glancing at her body)    Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn t what I had in mind.     Lucy:    But it s the perfect moment. We ve been dreaming about this for 16 years.     Jerry:    Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh.     Lucy:    (Lifts up a gun she has in her hand, and aims it at Jerry. She walks towards him) You are gonna draw me.     Jerry:    Aah! (Backs away)     Lucy:    Then you re going to fuck me in that car over there. (Points at an old-fashion car with the gun)  (Screen cuts to a part of the alien dimension that the Smith family s house is stranded in. Abradolph Lincoler, Morty, and Nancy are walking down a path, searching for the crystals. Morty is holding Ricks scanning device.)     Abradolph Lincoler:    (Thinking)       It s weird,  cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time --     Morty:    (Interupts him to shut him up) Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close.     Nancy:    (Points at big pink crystals growing out of the ground) There they are!  (Morty and Nancy both run to collect some, but are stopped by Abradolph Lincoler.)     Abradolph Lincoler:    Wait. Something s not right.  (A big two-headed creature attacks Abradolph Lincoler, knocking him down. Nancy shrieks.)     Abradolph Lincoler:    Get the crystals! I ll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! (He lunges at the creature, as he tackles it down. Nancy and Morty quickly grab some crystals and put them in a small bag.)     Nancy:    Summer s gonna like me again.   (The creature is still attacking Abradolph Lincoler. It strikes him down. Nancy and Morty watch, concerned.)  (Abradolph Lincoler throws the dead alien creature, as he sits and leans on a giant rock, exhausted. He is suffering from severe bleeding cuts. Morty and Nancy run up to him.)     Morty:    Lincoler, come on! Let s get out of here!     Abradolph Lincoler:    Mein journey is over, Morty. (Grunts) I have something important to tell you.  (The screen cuts to the living room. Everyone is listening to Gearhead singing a song while playing his guitar.)  Gearhead:  266a And the gears, they turned for a thousand years  266a  266a until the dark day that they stopped  266a  (Nancy and Morty run in)     Morty:    (Huff) Rick, I got them! I got the crystals! (He hands Rick the bag)     Rick:    All right! You did it, Morty. (Walks away)     Morty:    Rick, wait! There s something you need to know. I couldn t have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father.  (Nancy tears up)     Morty:    He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes. (Morty tears up and wipes his eye) He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died.  (Nancy comforts Morty)     Rick:    Well, at least he didn t die in vain. He got these crystals. (Rick cuts up the crystals into dust with his credit card, and snorts it up. Ricks eyes turn blue) And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something. Somebody, play something.  (A stereo robot presses a button to play a song. Morty and Nancy watch in confusion.)     Morty:    Wait a minute. What?  (A song starts, as Rick prepares himself. Everyone else is watching, bobbing their heads to the beat of the music.)     Rick:    (Dancing)   266a Put your right foot forward  266a  266a and your left foot back  266a  266a then fucking slide around  266a  266a like on a nordictrack  266a  (People start to copy him)     Rick:     266a move to the left  266a  266a step to the right  266a  266a wiggle your elbows, and look  266a  266a up into the light  266a     Song:     266a it s the, it s the  266a  266a it s the Rick dance  266a  266a it s the, it s the  266a  266a it s the Rick dance  266a  (The people who aren t dancing are watching and bobbing their head. Tammy is sitting on Birdperson s lap. They are both enjoying the dance.)     Rick:    Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam!  (Slow Mobius uses his magic clock wands to mess with time, and to make his dance look cool. A record rewinding can be heard.)     Song:     266a It s the, it s the  266a  266a it s the Rick dance  266a  (The song ends.)  (Everyone cheers)     Rick:    That s the Rick dance! All right! (burp) Whoa, man!     Morty:    What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!     Rick:    What? No, no, no. I can get us home whenever I want to. But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I m starting to come down, Morty. (His eye color turns back to normal) Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high. (He scratches the side of his face)  (Morty takes the bag of crystals and throws them outside. An alien grabs the bag and takes it away)     Morty:    That s what I think of your crystals, Rick!     Rick:    Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson?  (Birdperson shrugs)     Rick:    Uh, squanchy?     Squanchy:    Don t squaunch at me.  (The alien who took the crystals in seen doing the  Rick dance  in the background.)     Morty:    All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now.     Rick:    All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks!  (Everyone starts booing at Morty.)     Tammy:    Boo! You suck, whatever your name is.     Everyone:    Boo!     Rick:    Morty, you re the worst, Morty.  (Morty walks away, angry.)     Gearhead:    But these gears just started turnin .  (The scene cuts back to the Titanic. Nervous Jerry is drawing Lucy onto a notebook.)     Lucy   : Almost finished, Jerry?     Jerry:    Uh, almost. I haven t quite captured your beautiful eyes.     Lucy:    (Still holding the gun) I m sure it s good enough. Move!  (Screen cuts to the old-fashion car. Jerry and Lucy walk up to it.)     Lucy:    Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier. (She licks the car, as the floor of the car detatches.) But now it s my turn. We re going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I m going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you re going to love inside of me.  (Lucy shoves Jerry into the car. He whines in fear, as he clutches onto his drawing on the notebook.)     Lucy:    No mess. No clean.  (A book is thrown at Lucy, knocking her out. Beth threw it.)     Jerry:    (Reieved) Beth!     Beth:    Bet you re glad I think kindles are dumb now.  (Jerry runs over to Beth, hugging her. He throws the notebook with his drawing onto Lucy, as a few men, including the tour guide.)  (Screen cuts to the parking lot of the Titanic getaway. Jerry and Beth are outside their car, while Jerry is packing their stuff into the back.)     Beth:    I can t help but feel a little guilty. I didn t peg Lucy for a rapist.     Jerry:    What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips? (Feeling scared due to a flashback)     Beth:    What?  (Jerry glances around, not answering.)     Beth:    Well, at least you got all this free stuff. (She enters the door into the drivers seat, as Jerry closes the back door, and tries to fit a painting board from the titanic boat.)     Beth:    Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.     Jerry:    (Puts the board into the passenger seat) Ugh! I m not going to fit. (Hangs onto the board, recreating Jack s death from the Titanic movie. He slowly slips off) Beth, listen to me. You re going to get out of here. You re gonna go on, and --     Beth:    (Interrupts Jerry) Jerry, just leave the door.     Jerry:    It s not a door, Beth. It s debris.     Beth:    I don t care. Just leave it.     Jerry:    Yeah. Okay. (He takes out the board and leaves it on the ground, as he gets into the car. He has Lucy s necklace. He drops it out of the car window. Lucy is seen hanging onto the underneath of their car. The car starts moving)     Lucy:    Ahahahah! \""Cape fear\""! Hahahaha! \""Cape fear\""! I m -- I m doing -- I m -- I m going to do like from \""cape fear\"".  (Lucy accidentally lets go and gets run over by the car.)  Lucy: Ugh! Auh! Augh! (huff) (huff)   (Lucy is bleeding and very injured. She moans in pain, trying to crawl.)  (Screen cuts to where the hole is where Smith family s house was, as it teleports back there. People and aliens are seen leaving the house.)     Squanchy:    Hey, squanchers! The party s squanching on at my place!  (Everyone cheers on with Squanchy. Brad and Jessica are seen exiting the house too. Brad s arm is around Jessica. Morty sees this, shocked.)     Summer:    Cool. I m coming, too.     Squanchy:    (Stops Summer) Uh, no. You re not squanchy enough for a squanchy party.     Summer:    What?     Squanchy:    Nancy told us what a bitch you are. (Leaves)  (Nancy follows everyone else.)     Summer:    Guys, seriously. Nancy?     Nancy:    Summer, you re a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That s not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it s certainly not what he died for.  (Nancy leaves out the door, and Morty slams the door, mad.)  (The house is completely trashed. Rick flops onto the couch and falls asleep, while Summer sits on the small couch. Morty picks up a garbage bag and tries to clean up the mess.)     Summer:    Next time I party, I m just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked. (To Rick) You re so wise.  Rick: (Groan) (Mumbles) Hmm, yeah. Mhh mhm... (Rick falls asleep, snoring)  (Birdperson is at the entrance to the back yard. Morty walks up to him as Birdperson hands him a piece of trash.)     Birdperson:    May I assist you with that?     Morty:    Uh, sure, yeah. (Takes the trash and puts it in the garbage bag) Thanks. (Continues to pick up trash)     Birdperson:    Morty, do you know what \""wubba lubba dub dub\"" means?     Morty:    Uh, that s just Rick s stupid nonsense catchphrase.     Birdperson:    (Walks up to Morty) It s not nonsense at all. In my people s tongue, it means, \""I am in great pain. Please help me.\""     Morty:    Well, I got news for you. He s saying it ironically.  (Summer gets up from the couch and walks away.)  (Morty walks over to the giant hole that s blasted into the wall. Birdperson follows.)     Birdperson:    No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself.     Morty:    Come on, um...     Birdperson:    Birdperson.     Morty:    Come on, birdperson. Rick s not that complicated. He s just a huge asshole.     Birdperson:    Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.     Morty:    You know what? You re right. I shouldn t even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.  (Morty walks into the kitchen and throws the garbage bag on the floor. Summer is seen cleaning up the table by removing empty cups.)     Morty:    I m sick of having adventures with Rick.     Birdperson:    My people have another saying-- \""gubba nub nub doo rah kah\"". It means, \""whatever lets you sleep at night\"".  (Summers phone sounds a notification. She checks it.)     Summer:    Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner.     Birdperson:    This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy!  (Tammy jumps onto his back, and he takes flight.)     Birdperson:    Caw!  (Morty looks out the window to see Beth and Jerry s car drive around the corner and towards the house. He looks back to Rick, who is still napping.)     Summer:    Wow. We are so screwed.     Morty:    (Walks over to Rick, and shakes him) Rick, wake up.     Rick:    Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop.     Morty:    Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home.  Rick: Augh. Uh, all -- all right. (Sits up and grabs a glass of water sitting on the coffee table.) All right. Hold -- hold on. (He drinks from the glass) Ahh! So good.   (Morty looks out the window again.)     Morty:    Oh, my God. They re walking up the driveway.     Rick:    Bring me the thing.     Morty:    What -- what thing?     Rick:    (Rubbing his forehead and focusing) The thing. The thing. The -- the -- it s got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It -- it -- it beeps.     Morty:    Rick! That describes everything in your garage!     Summer:    (Walks up to Rick with a remove device) Do you mean this?     Rick:    Summer (burp) for for the win.  (Rick presses a button on the device, as orange rays of light flash.)     Rick:    All right, that should do it.     Morty:    Whoa! What did you do?     Rick:    Uh, s-see for yourself.  (Morty and Summer walk out of the house to discover that Rick has paused time. Beth and Jerry are stuck in place, and nothing is moving.)     Summer:    Whoa!     Rick:    Yeah, e-everything s frozen in time. Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he s all that.     Morty:    For how long?  (Summer waves her hand in Jerry s face to get his attention. He doesn t respond.)     Rick:    I don t know. How long do you guys want? A week? A month?      Summer:    Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?  (The scene cuts to multiple scenes of a montage of Rick, Morty, and Summer doing stuff together and having fun.)  (They are seen cleaning up the living room. Morty vacuuming, Summer wiping down a coffee table, and Rick sweeping.)  (The scene cuts to the three painting the now repaired wall. As Rick turns around, he accidentally flicks some paint onto Summer. The three then start flicking paint at each other for fun.)  (The scene cuts to Rick, Morty and Summer carving pumpkins, and placing them onto Beth and Jerry s heads)  (The scene cuts to the three running down a busy street, pulling the people s pants down, exposing them.)  (The scene cuts to the three running into Best Buy, and taking a new TV.)  (The scene cuts to Rick, Morty and Summer watching the Titanic on their new TV outside. The movie just ended.)     Rick:    Worst movie ever.     Summer:    Dumb.     Morty:    Ooh, boy, what a waste of time.   (Everyone realises the joke, and laugh together.)     Morty:    Get it? You know,  cause it s frozen.     Summer:    This has been so much fun.  Morty: Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven t once heard you say that \""wubba lubba dub dub\"" thing that you usually say.     Rick:    Don t need to. I have a (burp) new catchphrase.     Morty:    Oh, yeah? What -- what s that, Rick?     Rick:    love my grandkids.  Morty and Summer in unison: (Hug Rick) Aww.     Rick:    Psych! Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, \""I don t give a fuck\"".   (Rick turns on a radio, as he sings the lyrics, and dances. Morty and Summer join in.)     Rick and the song:     266a Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got  266a  266a just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got  266a Roll credits!  266a Just shake that a-- Roll the credits! Go!  266a Just shake that ass That s the end of season one!   (The screen zooms out.)     Rick:    That s the end, motherfucker! \""I don t give a fuck\"" is my new catchphrase! Fuck you! That s season one! Boom! Season one up in your face, motherfucker! Yeah!  (CREDITS)  (END CREDITS SCENE)  (Abradolph Lincoler is seen still dead on the rock. But he opens his eyes.)     Abradolph Lincoler:    Revenge.   (Abradolph Lincoler gets picked up by an alien.)     Abradolph Lincoler:    What?!  (The alien stuffs him into it s hole. Another alien comes up to him, and takes the shirtless guy out of it s hole.)     Shirtless guy:    Party!  (The other one pulls Abradolph Lincoler back out of it s hole, and they swap people with their holes. More aliens show up as they join in on it. Abradolph Lincoler and the shirtless guy are going back and forth into the aliens.)     Shirtless guy:    Whoo, baby!     Abradolph Lincoler:    Please, stop!     Shirtless Guy:    Hey, brah!     Abradolph Lincoler:    I don t understand. Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?     Shirtless Guy:    Yeah, you know it, dawg! Whoo, baby!

Outside of the [[Smith Residence]], [[Morty]] and [[Summer]] finish up some last minute cleaning duties while [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] and [[Beth Smith|Beth]] are still frozen outside. It's revealed that time has been frozen for nearly six months. Before [[Rick]] unfreezes time, he admits that 'their' time may need time to stabilize back within the 'world's time'. As a precaution, he tells Morty and Summer not to touch their parents at all, or otherwise their existence might fall apart at the seams.  When time is unfrozen, Mr. Benson falls off the roof while both Jerry and Beth are very clearly confused with the entire house not destroyed. Rick insists that Jerry was just seeing the negative and he warmly greets Beth. Beth attempts to hug her father and children, but they pull back, insisting it's because they missed them a lot and hugging would destroy them (it literally would). As a means to play it safe, Rick bribes the two into leaving to buy ice cream. He kicks a pile of unmarked bills to get them out of the house. Soon, Morty and Summer experience a bit of sibling rivalry over who's closer to Rick. As they shove each other, it generates a direct rift in time, creating two parallel realities which exist separately from each other. Rick tells his grandchildren that their 'uncertainty' has caused time to fracture into two equally possible impossibilities. Rick says they aren't in any timelines, and to prove it he opens the garage door to reveal the house floating in the middle of a black void surrounded by Schr\u00f6dinger's cats.  After getting ice cream, Jerry and Beth accidentally strike a deer. The deer isn't killed but severely injured. Beth takes it upon herself to help heal the deer. Beth takes the deer into a veterinary hospital and attempts to perform surgery. Before she begins her procedure, she notices a gunshot wound in its side. A hunter appears and says he was the one who shot him. He claims the deer belongs to him and calls his lawyer to help him gain ownership. The hunter's lawyer appears at the animal hospital and lets them know about Brad's Law and how legally the deer belongs to the hunter. Beth ignores him and continues to operate.  Rick uses a [[Time Crystal]] to try to mend the timelines together, but Morty and Summer's continued uncertainty prevents the fusion from working. Rick demands to know the reason behind their uncertainty. He deduces that the two of them 'want to be grandpa's favorite' and then sits them down in front of a whiteboard and cruelly tells both of them how little he cares about them and how little he values their contributions. His long speech clearly upsets both of them. Before Rick attempts to mend time together once again, Morty makes a quip about his drinking habits which directly result in Rick becoming uncertain. The time fusion fails for the second time and Rick immediately thinks that his 'other self' is trying to kill him off to fix the problem.  Rick quickly creates a pistol with his time crystal and attempts to kill the other self. A shootout opens up with both Ricks across timelines trying to murder each other. The chaos results in time splitting a second time, leading to four separate realities. Morty knocks out Rick from behind in order to calm him down. Morty and Summer put Rick into a dog crate. Rick reawakens in the crate and proves he's certain across all four timelines by calling himself and leaving a message. He then receives three other voicemails simultaneously. Suddenly, a [[Fourth Dimensional Being]] appears and scolds Rick for attempting to piece time together with just a crystal. He gives Rick, Morty, and Summer [[Time-Stabilizing Collar|time-stabilizing collars]] that then correctly fuse their times back to its regular place. However, since Rick obtained the time crystal by illegal means, the being tells them that they will go to [[Time Prison]] for eternity.  After the being calls for backup, Rick tricks him and makes a grab for his 'gun' [[Chris]], discarding and killing it. Rick orders Morty and Summer to remove their collars. He forces himself to be uncertain to split time once again. The three continue to split time in order to overwhelm the being, punching him across multiple timelines until he's defeated. As a consequence, time is now split across 64 different possibilities.  Beth's surgery continues with all the characters gathered around her. Jerry comes to the rescue by bringing members of a Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose, Deer, and Stag. The members can transport the deer across state lines to the best doctors, and outside the jurisdiction of the hunter's claim. The two drive back into the woods with the Cervine Institute members and Jerry reveals that the two men were not from the Cervine Institute, but were actually employees at Cold Stone Creamery. This allows Beth to continue her operation. She successfully patches up the deer, who springs to life and returns to the woods.  Rick, Morty, and Summer all attempt to put their collars on. Summer's works immediately, but due to a faulty Morty collar in one of the timelines (and Rick attempting to fix it), all of Morty and Rick's are still split. The broken-collared Morty attempts to hand the collar to Rick but with time destabilizing, falls into the black void. Rick dives after him, but Morty dropped his collar, so Rick gives Morty his collar. All Mortys are then safely teleported back. With one Rick floating in the spaceless void, he accepts death and tells Morty to be better than him. But then, Rick spots Morty's collar floating below him. He scrambles to collar while begging God for everything to work out. He fixes the collar, immediately denounces God, and then is teleported safely back with all others. Rick and Summer celebrate by doing the Cabbage Patch dance.  Beth and Jerry return while Jerry begins to make fun of the three's time collars while Beth laughs. Morty asks Rick if being the one who is taunted doesn't feel good to which Rick agrees that it hurts. The pan out at the end of the episode shows Mr. Benson below his house, receiving roses in a wheelchair, indicating that he still survived the fall. The after credits sequence shows two Fourth Dimensional Beings quickly navigate through Earth's history to find Rick. They stumble upon [[Albert Einstein]], thinking it's Rick, and promptly beat him up, warning him not to mess with time. This results in Einstein discovering E=mc<sup>2</sup> out of spite.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom.     Morty:    I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I ve been doing it for six months!     Summer:    Then you ve been doing it   wrong  <span style=\""font-style: normal\""> for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew?</span>     Morty:    It s not my fault we froze time on a humid day!     Summer:    You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?     Morty:    What? What kind of monster are you?     Summer:    A competent one.     Rick:    Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let s get this dumb universe rolling. Let s do this thing.  (Morty puts shirt on Jerry backwards.)     Rick:    Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world s time is gonna be fine, but our time s gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.     Morty:    Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?     Rick:    It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don t touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.     Morty:   <span style=\""font-weight: normal\""> Wait a minute, what?</span>     Rick:   <span style=\""font-weight: normal\""> And away we go!</span>  (Rick unfreezes time.)

(Jerry opens the door angrily)     Jerry:    ...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.     Rick:    Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you re at. Hi, sweety.     Beth:    Hi, dad.  (Summer and Morty recoil from Beth as she approaches to hug Rick)     Beth:    Summer, Morty, are you okay?     Morty:    W-We just missed you a lot.     Summer:    Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.  (Rick motions Summer and Morty behind him.)     Rick:    Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do 2014why do 2014why 2014why don t you guys go get a free Sundae ice cream, (Rick puts a rubber band around a rolled up wad of cash) go out there and get some ice creams. Here s five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I m just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.     Jerry:    This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won t save you. I ll get my jacket.

He then gets a call from an unknown person asking the person where they will meet and ends the lesson, citing that they have some business to attend to. He then gets startled when [[Jerry]] suddenly ask a question about navigation and gets asked by Rick why he is on the ship, to which he says that \""We [Rick and Jerry] agreed that a boy's father should be present when he's learning to drive\"". Rick exclaims that they do not have time to get him back home so they send him at [[Jerryboree]], a cross-temporal daycare designed specifically for Jerrys.  After they arrive at the location about the unknown caller, Rick tells him to wait but Morty is insistent to come but he rejects it and defends himself after Morty thinks what he is doing is shady. A gromflomite then knocks on the windows, gives Rick 3000 flerbos and then ask him if he has 'the weapon'. Rick introduces the person to Morty, and gives hive and antimatter gun. The gromflomite then introduces himself as [[Krombopulos Michael]], alien assasin. After Michael left, Morty then questions if he sends weapons to killers for money. Rick reveals that sold the gun to afford an afternoon at a video arcade [[Blips and Chitz]], which features a game called \""[[Roy: A Life Well Lived]]\"". Morty, upset by Rick's immoral decision, attempts to stop Krombopulous Michael from killing his target. After accidentally killing Krombopulous Michael with his poor spaceship piloting, Morty is introduced to the assassin's target, who assumes the name \""[[Fart]]\"".  Morty insists on freeing Fart and helping him get back to the wormhole he came through to return him to his race. [[Galactic Federation|Government]] forces give chase, leading to a shoot out with lots of civilian casualties, and Rick rages that none of these people would have died if Morty hadn't interfered with Krombopulous Michael. After returning Fart to the wormhole to his home planet, Fart reveals his plan to return with his race and \""cure\"" all carbon based life forms from the universe. Morty is then forced to make a moral decision, and kills his friend using the antimatter gun, meaning that all the deaths and destruction that resulted from his decision to save Fart were for nothing.  Meanwhile, Jerry has spent his time socializing with many other Jerrys at Jerryboree, before being picked up atop  the end of the day. The three are then called over by another Rick and Morty asking if they have their Jerry. Morty reveals he has lost his fathers number and only has a Blips and Chitz ticket. The two Ricks swap Jerrys without knowing which Jerry is which. The episode ends with a promotional ad for \""Blips & Chitz\"". ==Characters== *[[Rick Sanchez]] *[[Morty Smith]] *[[Jerry Smith]]  *[[Jerry Smith (C-131)|Jerry Smith (c-131)]] *[[Beth Smith]] (daycare costume) *[[Gearhead]] *[[Fart]] *[[Krombopulos Michael]] *[[Roy]] *Gear People *Alien Police *Alien Creatures from the season 2 promo *Gromflomites *[[Paul Fleishman]] *[[Mr. Meeseeks]] (Non-Speaking Cameo) *[[Jessica]] (Non-Speaking Cameo; Imagination Sequence) *[[Gwendolyn]] (Cameo; Imagination Sequence)",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Rick s Ship in Outer Space]  ([[Morty Smith|Morty]] drives, [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] sits in the passenger seat, and [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] is in the back.)     Rick:    00a0Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it s gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You 2019re gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.     Morty:    Cool.     Rick:    *points out the window* See that planet right there? Don 2019t fly too close to that planet. Someone 2019ll come out and try to wash your windshield. (Rick 2019s phone rings.) Hold on. *picks up* Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool. *hangs up* Alright Morty, lesson 2019s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here.     Jerry:    Oh, you still use  2018south 2019 in space?     Rick:    *startled* WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!     Jerry:    What are you talking about? We agreed a boy 2019s father should be present when he 2019s learning to drive.     Rick:    I   guess   I remember that. *rubs forehead* Wow. And you 2019ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don 2019t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917.     Jerry:    *chuckles* Cool! Looks like I 2019m comin 2019 along for an adventure!     Rick:    Yep.  [Trans. Empty space]     Morty:    This is where we 2019re going?     Rick:    Nope. (An asteroid-like mass materializes before them.) This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.  (Morty parks clumsily.)  [Trans. Int. [[Jerryboree]]]  ([[Human Music]] plays in the lobby as Rick signs Jerry in.)     Jerry-Sitter:    Well look at this fella. *pinches Jerry 2019s cheek* Aren 2019t you handsome?     Jerry:    Thank you! I 2019m Jerry. *extends hand*     Jerry-Sitter:    *as if speaking to a child* Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship?  (She guides Jerry through a set of doors.)     Jerry:    I 2019m travelling with my son and father-in-law. Uh, wait, are they coming?     Jerry-Sitter:    Oh, they 2019ll be back soon.     Jerry:    What?  (A set of sliding doors open, revealing a room full of Jerrys from different dimensions.)     Pajama Jerry:    I don 2019t know how this works!     Underpants Jerry:    Help me!     Jerry:    What the hell?     Pajama Jerry:    I know, right?     Tuxedo Jerry:    *enters room* Oh, what the hell?     Jerry:    I know, right?  [Trans. Jerryboree Lobby]     Morty:    *looking at a pamphlet* Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?     Rick:    You kidding? I   wish   I had this idea. Well 2026 I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy 2019s rich.     Receptionist:    Don 2019t forget to check the reason for your drop-off.     Rick:    *checks off  201cStowaway 201d and  201cAnnoying me 201d* Trust me Morty, I 2019ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don 2019t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn 2019t be safer.  (As they walk out, Rick hands Morty a ticket.)     Rick:    Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number 2019s your dad. If you lose it, we 2019re not gonna be able to get him back.  [Intro sequence]  [Trans. Parking garage]  (Morty parks the ship clumsily, damaging nearby vehicles.)     Rick:    Okay, wait here.     Morty:    I wanna come with.     Rick:    Don 2019t come with. It 2019s boring, it 2019s *burps* business stuff.     Morty:    What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.     Rick:    Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th 2014in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip  2018em in cocaine, and they wipe  2018em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn 2019t shady.  ([[Krombopulos Michael]] knocks on Rick 2019s window.)     Rick:    Ah, crap. *rolls down window* Hey, what 2019s up?     Krombopulos Michael:    Hey, Rick! Haha! Here you go, three thousand [[Flurbo]]s! D 2019you have the weapon?     Rick:    Can 2026 Can we please 2026? This is my   grandson  , Morty.     Krombopulos Michael:    Well hi Morty! I 2019m Krombopulos Michael! I 2019m an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa.     Rick:    Ugh. *passes Krombopulos Michael a case containing the antimatter gun* Here, now go away.     Krombopulos Michael:    *examines weapon* Ooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So this shoots antimatter? My target can 2019t be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty! Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered, *passes Morty his card* please give me a call. I 2019m very discrete 2014     Rick:    Y-Y-Y-You 2019re gonna give him your card?!     Krombopulos Michael:    I have no code of ethics, I will kill anyone, anywhere! Children, animals, old people, doesn 2019t matter. I just love killin 2019!  (Krombopulos Michael leaves.)     Morty:     2026You sell weapons to killers for money?     Rick:    Ugh 2026 You 2019ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It 2019s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?     Morty:    Uh, what?     Rick:    An entire afternoon at [[Blips and Chitz|Blips and Chiiiitz]]!  [Trans. Blips and Chitz]     Rick:    Aw, this place is the best. It 2019s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.     Morty:    You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?     Rick:    Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. *puts a helmet on Morty 2019s head* Here, check this out.  (Morty 2019s eyes roll back into his head.)  [Trans. [[Roy: A Life Well Lived|Roy 2019s]] room]     Roy:    Ah!  (Roy wakes up, frightened and panting.)     Roy 2019s mother:    Roy, what 2019s wrong?     Roy:    I 2026had a nightmare. I was with an old man 2026 He put a helmet on me.     Roy 2019s mother:    It 2019s just a fever. Get some sleep, I don 2019t want you missing school on Monday. *walks out of the room and switches off the lights*  [Trans. Roy 2019s school]     Teacher:    I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future. (Roy looks outside and sees kids playing with a football. He smiles.) Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.  [Trans. Football game]  (Roy is now older, and a football player.)     Announcer:    Spiraling perfectly, it 2019s gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20! (Roy makes eye contact with a girl in the stands.) Now he 2019s at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy the Rocket! Touchdown!  [Trans. Roy 2019s kitchen]  (Roy is older, now married to the girl from the football game with a young son. They 2019re eating dinner.)     Roy 2019s wife:    I just think it 2019s time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy?  [Trans. Carpet store]  (Roy now works at the carpet store. He gets a call from his doctor.)  [Trans. Doctor 2019s office]     Doctor:    Had we caught it sooner 2026 Well, hindsight is 20-20, Roy. What 2019s important is that we move quickly.  [Trans. Hospital room]  (Roy is battling cancer. His wife, older, sits with him.)     Roy:    I 2019m not 2026ready to die 2026     Roy 2019s wife:    *takes his hand* You 2019re not going to.  [Trans. Roy 2019s house]  (Roy survived surgery. His wife wheelchairs him into the house, where friends and relatives applaud his entry. A streamer reads  201cCANCER CAN 2019T BEAT THE ROCKET 201d)  [Trans. Carpet store]  (Roy is older still, now greying and wearing glasses.)     Customer:    Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy.  (Roy shakes his hand, then sits and looks fondly at a trophy that reads  201cWorld 2019s Greatest Dad. 201d)     Voice:    *shouting from off screen* Hey Roy, you pull those Persian off-white shags for the clearance sale?  (Roy gets up and steps onto a short ladder to retrieve the rugs. He loses his balance.)     Roy:    Whoa. Sh-shit! Shit!  (He hits the ground and dies. Text reads  201cGAME OVER 201d.)  [Trans. Blips and Chitz]  (Morty regains consciousness and removes the helmet, frightened and confused.)     Morty:    Whoa! What the hell?! Wha 2014Where am I?! What the hell?!     Rick:    Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase.     Morty:    *looks around, grips his head* W 2026 Where 2019s my wife?     Rick:    Morty. You were just playing a game. It 2019s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. *hands him his tickets*     Morty:    I 2019m Morty 2026 You 2019re Rick 2026 Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!     Rick:    Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.  (Rick sits in the seat to play Roy.)     Morty:    Don 2019t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!     Rick:    It 2019s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there 2019s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That 2019s why he does it for a living? Now if you 2019ll excuse me, it 2019s time to thrash your Roy score. *puts on the helmet*     Morty:    You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!     Rick:    Uh-huh, yeah, that 2019s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store.     Alien:    *passing by, sees Rick playing Roy* Holy shit! This guy 2019s taking Roy off the grid! (Other alien patrons gasp and congregate around Rick.) This guy doesn 2019t have a social security number for Roy!  (Morty looks at Krombopulos Michael 2019s business card, which shows his location, and walks away.)  [Trans. Jerryboree]  (Jerry approaches the Jerrysitter from earlier.)     Jerry:    Hi, I 2019m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I 2019m an adult and would like to go home, please.     Jerry-Sitter:    Well of course! Right through that tube. *points to a tube in the wall*     Jerry:    *muttering to self* Unbelievable. *approaches the tube and starts climbing in*     Jerry-Sitter:    You 2019re doing great!     Jerry:    *indignantly* I know how to crawl in a tube. *to himself, while crawling* Ugh 2026 Come on 2026 This is harder than it looks 2026 (Suddenly the tube transitions into a slide.) Whoooooaaaa!  (Jerry lands in a ballpit in an area designed similarly to the Smith house. Other Jerrys are in the ballpit playing Marco Polo.)     Pink-shirt Jerry:    Marco? (Jerrys laugh.) Marco?     Other Jerry:    Come find me.     Pink-shirt Jerry:    Marco? (Jerrys laugh again.)  (Our Jerry seems disturbed.)     Jerry:    You guys are enjoying this? Don 2019t you feel a little 2026 patronized?     Pink-shirt Jerry:    How so?  (Someone dressed in a large [[Beth Smith|Beth]] costume approaches the ballpit.)     Daycare Beth:    Jerry!     Other Jerry:    Beeeth.     Jerry:    Oh, come on, this is ridiculous!     Daycare Beth:    I love you, Jerry!     Jerry:    Aw 2026 Beth 2026     Daycare Beth:    Who wants to come watch Midnight Run with director 2019s commentary on?     Jerrys:    Oh! Yes! Definitely!     Daycare Beth:    First one there gets to adjust the picture settings!  (Jerrys become more excited.)     Jerry:    The factory tint setting is always too high! *climbs out of the ballpit and hurries after  201cBeth 201d with the other Jerrys*     Other Jerry:    Out of my way!     Another Jerry:    The factory tint setting is always too high!  [Timeskip]  (Daycare Beth sits on a couch with a Jerry on each side of her and dozens of other Jerrys surrounding them, watching Midnight Run.)  [Trans. Government outpost]  (Krombopulos Michael prepares to carry out the hit. He holds up a heart shaped locket with a picture of a presumed romantic partner in it, kisses the locket, and puts it away.)     Krombopulos       Michael:    Oh boy, here I go killin 2019 again!  (Krombopulos Michael sneaks through the building, killing several [[Gromflomites|Gromflomite]] guards along the way before arriving in the chamber his target is kept. His target appears to be a strange, gaseous being. Krombopulos Michael draws his weapon, but before he can shoot, Morty crashes Rick 2019s ship through the ceiling, crushing him.)     Ship:    You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael. Your destination is below.     Morty:    *dazed* All out of off-white Persians 2026 *gets out of the ship and realizes he killed Krombopulos Michael* Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?! *picks up KM 2019s arm and the antimatter gun*     Gromflomite:    (pointing a gun at Morty) Drop the gun!     Morty:    You don 2019t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!     Gromflomite:    I guess that makes two of us. *fires up his weapon*  (A portal forms through the guard, bisecting him down the middle, and Rick walks out of it.)     Rick:    What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don 2019t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don 2019t get along!     [[Fart]]:    You saved my life!  (Rick and Morty both turn to face the gaseous being.)     Rick:    What?     Morty:    Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael 2019s target? W-Wwwwhat 2019s your name?     Fart:    My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call  201cJessica 2019s feet. 201d No,  201ctelepathy. 201d     Rick:    Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!     Fart:    I like this name,  2018Fart. 2019 Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain.     Rick:    Morty, don 2019t do it. (Morty walks toward the lever.) Morty 2026 (Morty glances at Rick before pulling the lever. Alarms start to sound as Fart escapes his cell.) Morty, you idiot!     Morty:    Oh crap, let 2019s get you outta here!     Rick:    We can 2019t get him outta here. He 2019s gaseous. He 2019s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.     Morty:    *stomps past Rick* Well then I guess we 2019re all getting in the car! Right, uh 2026     Fart:    Fart.     Morty:    No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car!  (Fart floats into the car and Morty sits in the driver 2019s seat.)     Rick:    Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don 2019t wanna deal with this!     Morty:    Y-You 2019ve been clear on the fact that you don 2019t wanna help, so just go away!     Fart:    More are coming.  (Rick starts walking off.)     Rick:    Screw this. I 2019m out.  (Rick forms a portal and leaves through it. Morty tries to start the car as a Gromflomite approaches, but it stalls.)     Morty:    Oooh 2026! Come on, come on!     Gromflomite:    Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire!     Morty:    *still trying to start the car* Oh no no no!     Gromflomite:    Open fire!  (A portal appears directly above the guards and water pours out of it, flooding the room. Another portal appears on the floor, and the water and Gromflomites are sucked into it. A third portal then appears and Rick emerges through it, walking up to the car.)     Rick:    Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker! *shoves Morty out of the driver 2019s seat and takes the wheel* Move!  (Fart moves to the backseat as Morty takes the passenger seat.)     Rick:    Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?  (Morty buckles up and Rick begins adjusting the seat settings.)     Fart:    More are coming.  (More Gromflomites storm into the room. Rick continues adjusting the seat.)     Morty:    Rick!     Rick:    Yeah, yeah. (He crashes the car into the Gromflomites before flying away from the outpost.)  [Trans. [[Gear World]], Int. Gearhead 2019s shop/residence]  (Rick, Morty, and Fart wait while [[Gearhead]] works on the car. Morty and Fart are watching [[Gazorpazorpfield]].)     Gearhead:    Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.     Rick:    That 2019s  2018cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.     Gearhead:    Actually, it 2019s because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they 2019re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire 2014     Rick:    *interrupts him* So I 2019ve heard. Just fix it. *to Morty* I don 2019t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we 2019re gonna be here for awhile. *lowers voice* Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.     Fart:    You do understand I 2019m telepathic, right?     Rick:    I 2019m being polite.     Morty:    Rick, we 2019re taking him back where he belongs!     Rick:    Yeah, where 2019s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?     Fart:    I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call  201cget out of my head, Fart, I know you 2019re in here, la la la la 2014 201d No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula.     Rick:    Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!     Morty:    You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick.     Rick:    *walks away, muttering* Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch 2026     Fart:    Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based life forms. You put the value of all life above your own.     Morty:    That 2019s how things should be. It 2019s how they could be.     Fart:    I could not agree more.  (Fart envelops Morty as  201c[[Goodbye Moonmen]] 201d begins.)     Fart:    (singing over a montage formed from Morty 2019s imagination) The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes. / The ground can be space (space, space, space, space) / With feet marching toward a peaceful sky. / All the moonmen want things their way / But we make sure they see the sun. / Goodbye, moonmen / You say goodbye, moonmen. / Goodby 2014     Rick:    *holding a golf club* Shut the fuck up about moonmen!

However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this. (An electric fuzz seems to go through the gaseous cloud and a lump of gold materializes, dropping to the ground beneath him.) That was oxygen. I added seventy-one protons to it.     Rick:    *picks up the gold* Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin 2019 for us! *pockets gold* Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that 2019s gonna be to my work?  (Sirens sound outside. Rick rushes to the window and sees police in flying vehicles have surrounded the place.)     Rick:    Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead 2026 *turns around*     Gearhead:    *pointing a gun at Rick* I 2019m sorry, Rick. The reward on your head is too high. And like you always say, you gotta look out for Number One.     Rick:    Number One is   me  , asshole! You 2019re supposed to be my friend!     Gearhead:    Friend? Do you even know my real name? It 2019s Revolio Clockberg Junior. I belong to an entire   species   of gear people.

He throws them at Gearhead and they get caught in his mouth, causing him to drop the gun.)     Gearhead:    No, not twigs!  (Rick kicks Gearhead in the crotch, removes his gear-testicles, pulls two gears out of his mouth, and shoves the gear-testicles in their place while Gearhead moans in pain, clutching his mouth and groin.)     Rick:    Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it 2019s time to go.  (Rick, Morty, and Fart get in the car and fly out through a window.

Rick:    Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?     Morty:    I did the right thing, Rick!     Rick:    Tell that to Gearhead 2019s gearsticles.     Morty:    You did that!     Rick:    Wrong! I 2019d be playin 2019 Roy right now.

At this point, the car is surrounded.)     Rick:    Shit. Well, I guess this is it.     Fart:    Morty, crack the window.  (Morty open the window and Fart flies out, entering a gear policecar and entering the officer 2019s mind.)     Fart:    I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend.

To us, you are what you would call a disease. Wherever we discover you, we cure it. You said yourself that life must be protected even through sacrifice.

Independence|alien starship]]. Rick intercepts and boards the starship with the intention of looting it, but instead he comes across the ship's surviving crew members, who explain [[Unity's Planet|their planet]] has been taken over by an assimilating hive-mind, before the aforementioned hive mind attacks and assimilates the rest of the crew. To the trio's shock, the hive mind apparently knows Rick, who awkwardly admits that he and the hive mind, named Unity, used to \""date.\""  Back on the planet Unity overtook, Unity explains how it was able to take over the entire population, unifying the world and improving the quality of the inhabitants' life, at the cost of their free will and individuality. Despite being treated well by Unity, Summer protests the loss of the original population's individuality, but, as Unity controls every mind on the planet, her attempts to \""free\"" the inhabitants do not go very far. Elsewhere on the planet, Unity and Rick waste no time rekindling their relationship rather extravagantly. Not long after, a neighboring hive mind called [[Beta-Seven]] arrives on a routine trading mission. Beta-Seven is ostensibly attempting to pursue a closer relationship with Unity, but its awkward efforts only cause Rick to make fun of it. As it leaves, Rick notices the materials Beta Seven left behind can be mixed into various drugs to help spice up his and Unity's partying and kinky sex.  Meanwhile, back on Earth, Jerry enters the garage looking for the weed-whacker because the weeds in the cracks made from the house being transported to another dimension have started to become overgrown. He is confronted by Beth, who chastises him for being in the garage when Rick is not present. The two argue, but are interrupted by a gurgling sound from under what they discover to be a hatch in the floor.  Back on Unity's planet, Morty and Summer notice that Unity's control on the population appears to be slipping, and the inhabitants begin to regain their minds. However, the newly freed people almost immediately begin a race war among themselves. Morty and Summer are almost caught in the crossfire before Unity manages to rescue them. While Unity is transporting them to Rick, they notice Unity's inebriated state and realize that the drug-and-alcohol laden parties are hurting Unity's ability to control the population.  Back at home, Beth and Jerry descend into the underground lair and discover [[Blim Blam]], a [[Korblockians|Korblockian]] that eats babies, imprisoned by Rick in order to cure his \""Space AIDS\"". They soon begin bickering, to the point where the creature, fed up with the arguing, breaks free of his restraints, steals a translation device from the lab, and angrily explains the reason for his imprisonment and berates them both about how awful their marriage is, and then leaving, promising never to return to Earth.  On Unity's planet, Morty and Summer try to get Rick to go home with them, but Rick dismisses them, sending them home via portal before continuing to party with Unity. At this point, Summer and Morty warn Unity and Rick about the terrible influence they have on each other and tell Unity to, \""take care of [itself]\"".  Later, when Rick leaves Unity to use the restroom, all the planet's inhabitants are gone, leaving behind farewell notes for Rick explaining that, while Unity enjoyed its time with him, they cannot be together; they are too alike in the sense that both of them turn others into mirror images of themselves, though in Rick's case, he does so through bad influence rather than assimilation. Unity mentions that Rick is even better at fulfilling what itself was destined to do through coming into existence as a hive-mind; that Rick is able to change others yet is not able to be reformed himself, which leads to his self-destructive, reckless nature eventually bringing those around him down with him and invariably sentences them to suffer because of his own emotional barriers and methods of resisting the inevitability of meaninglessness and his own pain. It ends the letter by affirming that it loves him and is upset it cannot be with him.  Depressed and alone, Rick returns home, where he is confronted by Beth over the basement lair and the escaped alien. To Beth's (and the whole family's) shock, Rick simply concedes and retreats to the garage. Here, he dejectedly assembles the parts of a death ray and unfreezes a deformed, distressed creature (possibly a Cronenberg) he had been storing. On the verge of tears, he lovingly comforts the screaming, suffering creature before vaporising it with the death ray. He then prepares to do this to himself, but passes out unconscious before the machine can fully prepare the ray, causing him to barely survive this suicide attempt. He then laid passed out at his workstation in the garage for the rest of the day and night. The episode ends zooming out to show Rick passed out at his desk the next morning and Jerry happily whacking the weeds in the driveway.  After the credits, Rick and Morty are at Beta-Seven's mothership, where Unity is staying. Rick demands to see Unity. Beta-Seven informs Rick he is considered a \""hostile entity\"" and threatens to attack the two unless they leave, which Rick reluctantly does at Morty's urging."," <p dir=\""ltr\"" style=\""line-height:1.9871999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\""><span style=\""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#222222;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\"">  Open Ext.

Uncle Steve then admits that he bought them as a thank you to the family for letting him stay for the past year. When [[Rick]] comes into the room, he doesn't know who Uncle Steve is, and the family rebuffs him, claiming that Uncle Steve has stayed with them for the past year. Rick then pulls out a laser pistol and shoots Uncle Steve, who turns out to be a monster. While the Smith family gasp in shock at the realization that Uncle Steve wasn't real, Rick informs them that he was a parasite, an alien species that survive and multiply by implanting fake memories into people's head so they can conquer planets. He tells them to be aware of \""wacky, zany characters that suddenly appear\"" and is encouraged by a newly introduced zany character, [[Mr. Poopybutthole]].  In the living room, everyone is checking for more parasites. Rick makes a sign and places it on the wall saying that there should only be 6 people in the house: Rick, Morty, Jerry, [[Beth]], Mr. Poopybutthole, and [[Summer]]. Saying that they can't take chances of letting parasites out of the house, he activates blast shields that keep people from coming in or out of the house, much to the chagrin of the rest of the family. Mr. Poopybutthole encourages the family to remember the time the family got stuck in an elevator after watching a musical featuring The Hulk and were freed by \""[[Cousin Nicky]]\"". The memory flashback causes a parasite to multiply, and Cousin Nicky is shown in the room. After looking at the sign, Rick shoots Cousin Nicky in the shoulder, which turns him into a dead parasite. After another memory flashback, where a Nazi as well as a butler named [[Mr. Beauregard]] appear. As more and more memory flashbacks occur, more and more parasite characters appear (such as [[Frankenstein's Monster]], a man named Sleepy Gary who is [[Beth]]'s husband, food themed warriors, etc.). Rick starts to become irritated at the surplus of parasites and insults them all while they attempt to persuade Rick to disable the blast shields. After being goaded into having a flashback of having a barbecue with more characters, he is pushed over the edge and the house is filled. As arguing ensues, Jerry has suspicions that he is a parasite and confides in Sleepy Gary, who he truly believes is Beth's husband. Comforting him, Sleeping Gary implants a memory of he and Jerry having an affair while on a vacation, making the latter believe that they are in love.  As he insults more and more parasites, the aliens start to turn suspicion onto Rick, manipulating the false memories in the Smiths to turn them against him. The Smiths constantly attempt to persuade Rick into freeing everyone from the household even after [[Reverse Giraffe]] speaks. After he refuses to do so, the parasites soon beat up Rick and steal the watch that controls the blast shield. After Rick insults the Smith Family (mostly Morty) for not trusting him, Morty takes Rick's gun. Unable to kill Rick in front of a zany character named [[Pencilvester]], [[Baby Wizard]], [[Duck With Muscles]] and Morty take him out to the garage. After telling Rick that he'll remember him as a friend and unsatisfied, Rick retorts that he'll remember Morty as a \""whiny bitch\"" citing that a minority of his memories of Morty were pleasant, and the majority were just pure annoyance. However, after listening to Ricks statement about good and bad memories, Morty has an epiphany and shoots Baby Wizard and Duck with Muscles. He explains to Rick that he found the tell-tale sign; the parasites were only capable of creating pleasant memories. So, he was able to know that Rick was real by all the terrible memories he had of him. Realizing Morty's theory was correct, Rick unlocks his armory and they both heavily arm themselves.  Coming back into the house, Rick and Morty fire warning shots into the air and explain that they need to kill everyone that can only be remembered fondly. They begin by questioning [[Mrs. Refrigerator]], who attempts to prove that she was in an unpleasant memory by passing off a roller-coaster ride as screaming torment. Beth tells Mrs. Refrigerator that rollercoasters are more thrilling than unpleasant and reminds her that she had be a perfect companion to her for her entire life. Mrs. Refrigerator goes into a panic, tries to claw her way through the blast shields and is shortly killed and exposed as a memory parasite. Rick questions Summer who is annoyed at the accusation being made against her. Morty then validates Summer's existence as he recalls her kicking him in the groin when she believed him of going into her room, despite Morty protesting his innocence while cringing on the ground. After being armed, Summer joins the two in questioning Beth. Summer then remembers when she asked her drunk mother to take her to school for picture day and was given a black eye when Beth accidentally hits her with a wine bottle. Beth kills a bear like parasite (who had compatible kidneys with her) and the Smiths kill the remaining parasites. As they kill parasites, Summer confirms Morty is real by remembering accidentally walking in on him masturbating in the kitchen. Beth kills Sleepy Gary, sending Jerry into a depression, asking Beth to kill him so they can be together in death. To her chagrin, Beth remembers a memory when Jerry was being chased by a feral homeless man with a broken bottle and locks himself inside the car, leaving Beth to fend for herself.   Back downstairs, Rick comes across Pencilvester and has such fond \""memories\"" of him, that he can't bring himself to kill him. Rick then asks Morty to kill Pencilvester. After killing Mr. Beauregard, Rick jokes that ''he'' did the butler, though [[Ghost in a Jar]] is the only one who gets it. Rick thanks Ghost in a Jar before shooting him as well, and eventually all the parasites are destroyed.  The family and Mr. Poopybutthole then sit down for dinner. Beth, being suspicious of the lack of bad memories of Mr. Poopybutthole, pulls out a ray gun and blasts him. However, it turns out that Mr. Poopybutthole is actually real, as instead of reverting into a parasite, he is blasted into a wall and begins bleeding out from the wound in his torso. The family calls an ambulance, while Beth runs into the kitchen. Panicked, she pours a glass of wine with very shaky hands and downs it with eyes almost blinded with tears.  The post-credits scene reveals that Mr. Poopybutthole is alive and recovering in physical therapy. The nurse informs the family that Mr. Poopybutthole does not wish to see them right now, and that he is \""sorry you didn't have bad memories of him\"". As Jerry comforts Beth, Rick does one of his weird catchphrases.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

It is the fourth episode of [[Season 2]] 00a0and it aired on 00a0August 16, 2015.  == Transcript == (Smith family is eating, Jerry checks his mail)  Jerry: Steve, I just got a weird e-mail. Did you buy us airline tickets?  Uncle Steve: Aw shoot, it was supposed to be a surprise! I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time, so I m treating the family to a vacation!  Beth: Steve, you re so sweet!  Morty: Thanks Uncle Steve!  Summer: Best uncle ever!  Uncle Steve: Look out world, the Smith family is goin  to Paris!  Summer: (offscreen) Yeah! Awesome!  (Rick enters the room, and dumps some very familiar-looking rocks into the kitchen trash)  Jerry: Rick, I don t like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash.  Rick: Well, I don t like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions.  Jerry: I, you know what, I-  Uncle Steve: You re gonna land on your feet Jer. Some company out there s gonna thank they re lucky stars they hired my little brother.  Rick: Who the fuck are you?  Jerry: My goofy brother Steve. He s been living here almost a year now, are you losing your mind?  Uncle Steve: Hey someone s been spending too much time around glowing rocks am I right? (Everybody except Rick laughs, Rick pulls out a gun and shoots Steve in the head)  (The family screams)  Morty: What the hell, Rick? What the hell?  Rick: Everybody just relax for a second. There s no such thing as an \""Uncle Steve.\"" That is an alien parasite.  (Uncle Steve s body turns into a blue and purple worm-like creature, spewing pink liquid all over Jerry)  (Beth and Summer gasp)   Jerry: But I ve known him my whole life!  Rick: No, you haven t Jerry. (Rick puts on a pair of gloves and places the creature s body on the table, spewing pink liquid on the table, and examines it) These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It s disgusting.  Morty: Steve wasn t real?  Rick: He s a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit.  Summer: Someone?  Rick: Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won t stop texting on the toilet.  Morty: But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike.  Rick: No, \""Steve\"" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.  Mr. Poopybutthole: Ooh wee, whatever you want Rick! We re here to help!  Rick: Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you. (Mr. Poopybutthole passes a cartridge case to Rick who places it in his gun)  <nowiki>*</nowiki>Theme song plays*  (In the living room, the Smith family and Mr. Poopybutthole search for more parasites as Rick does a head count)  Rick: Alright, there s six of us and that s it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.  Mr. Poopybutthole: Maybe you got the first one in time Rick!  Rick: Can t afford to chance it.  (Rick presses a button on his watch, all doors and windows in the house are sealed off by blast shields)  Beth: Dad, why does our house have blast shields?  Rick: Trust me, Beth, you don t wanna know how many answers that question has.  Poopybutthole: Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic! Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together. Y-- remember that? After the Hulk musical?  (Flashback: The family is stuck in an elevator. Jerry is wearing Hulk gloves and punching the elevator buttons. Morty is holding his crotch trying not to pee himself.)  Beth: Jerry, buttons don t work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don t make you strong.  Jerry: I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did.  Rick: Why couldn t I bring my portal gun?  Morty: Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the Hulk. I just got that.  Summer: Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck. (all stare at Summer) Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I m disgusting, it s on purpose.  Mr. Poopybutthole: Oh, y all, we re gonna be fine. I ve always been here for you guys, and I always will be. ( chuckles )  Nicky: Somebody call for repairs?  All: Yay! Cousin Nicky!  Nicky: It s me, Cousin Nicky. I m walkin  here! I mean, I m not. I m crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I m walkin  here! ( laughter )  (Cut back to the present)  Nicky: It s true. We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we re cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. L-let s get some fresh air.  Morty: Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there s no more of these things.  Nicky: I hear you, Morty. Back in Brooklyn, we got a sayin  -- \""we re walkin  here!\"" ( laughter )  Jerry: Nicky! (Rick shoots Nicky in the shoulder, and he reverts back into a parasite)  Nicky: Oh! ( gasps ) ( groaning )  Morty: What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!  Rick: Six, Morty! There s supposed to be six of us! If there s seven, then that means somebody s not real.  Beth: But how did you know it was Nicky?  Rick: I guessed. That s why I aimed for his shoulder.  Beth: So we can t trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old nazi submarine. Did that not even happen?  Jerry: Well, of course it happened.  (Flashback: Morty, Rick, Jerry, Beth and Nicky are tied up, a Nazi stands before them)  Nazi: Now that I possess the mighty staff of Rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the Fourth Reich!  Morty: This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.  Nicky: Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal.  Nazi: I m comfortable being called a Nazi. You think there s some other word that will hurt my feelings? (Hits Nicky on the head) Yeah. Think before you talk shit. Rah-gubaba, help me kill America! (Mr. Beauregard knocks out the Nazi)  All: Mr. Beauregard!  Mr. Beauregard: After due consideration, I have elected not to retire.  All: Yeah! Oh, thank god!  Mr. Beauregard: Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend. Set a course for Morty s high school.   (Return to the present)  Mr. Beauregard: Perhaps I m biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn t still be the family butler. ( chuckles ) dare to dream.  Rick: Wait.  Summer: And if Mr. Beauregard wasn t our butler, it s safe to say the family d be in a hell of a lot of trouble. ( laughter )  Rick: No! Don t flashback!  (Flashback: Jerry has his head stuck in the staircase railing)  Summer: You re just gonna make more swelling.  Beth: Don t worry, Jerry. Just relax. We called the fire department.  Jerry: You know they won t come here anymore. ( grunting )  (Mr. Beauregard pours marmalade on Jerry and his head slips out, all gasp )  Mr. Beauregard: Marmalade is served. (everybody cheers)  Frankenstein: I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine. ( laughter )  (Flashback: Rick, Summer, and Mr. Beauregard are having a pillow fight)  Rick: Take that!  Sleepy Gary: We re trying to sleep.  (Flashback: Morty is in the living room with Beth, Jerry, and Sleepy Gary)  Morty: I don t want to go to the dance alone.  Mr. Beauregard (Off-screen): Then perhaps, you shouldn t.  (Mr. Beauregard appears, in a dress)  Beth: Aww. Mr. Beauregard.  Mr. Beauregard: Shall we, master Morty?  Morty: We shall.  Beth: Oh, wait, don t leave without letting Photography Raptor take a picture. ( raptor screeches ) ( camera shutter clicks )  ( cut back to the present, laughter )  Rick: Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There s only supposed to be six people in this house.  But there s always been 10.  Rick: No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there s four parasites.  Frankenstein: You sure about that, Rick?  Mr. Beauregard: Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number.  Rick: All right, there s six of us, ( belches ) and that s it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.  Beth: Uh, dad, that s like 10 people.  Rick: 6, 10, what s the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where s my pencil at?  Pencilvester: Right here, Rick! Use me!  Rick: Oh, thanks, Pencilvester! (writes the number 6 again) Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don t get why I would do that.  Pencilvester: Everybody makes mistakes, Rick. Why do you think I have one of these? ( laughter, camera shutter clicks )  Beth: That s it. Photos. Hard evidence. (Beth scrolls through photos, becomes suspicious) You re not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole.  Mr. Poopybutthole: Well, what do you know about this? You re not in any of mine.  Summer: All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school. (everybody else stares at Summer) What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It s not like we re Mormon or dying.  Frankenstein: I will admit it s suspicious that Summer s only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we ve never seen.  (Summer flashes back: Summer is asleep in her room and Tinkles flies in.)  Tinkles: Summer!  Summer: Tinkles! It s past my bedtime.  Tinkles: ( giggles ) Not in never past bedtime land! Here we go!  (Tinkles grabs Summer s hand and they fly out the window. A musical montage begins.)   266a Summer and Tinkles  266a  266a friends with each other  266a  266a living in never past bedtime land  266a  266a no kitchen sinkles  266a  266a no little brother  266a  266a going to raves and waving our hands  266a (Rapper rapping )  266a Summer and Tinkles, friends to the end  266a  266a group text the whole crew, my motherfuckin  friends!  266a  266a ketchup to the salt, salt to the fry  266a  266a \""t\"" to the \""inkle\"" with a capital \""I\""  266a  (Scene cut s back to Summer s bedroom, revealing that she was only dreaming)  Summer: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Gary: Summer, we re trying to sleep.  Summer: It was Tinkles! Tinkes?  (Cut back to the present)  Rick: That is su-- [belches] -- suspicious. We re always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to  2013  Tinkles: Hi, everybody. I m Tinkles, and these are my friends. ( all sigh )  Summer: See, everyone? Tinkles is real. That means so am I.  (Everyone except Rick apologizes to Summer)  Frankenstein: I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one.  Jerry: Okay, look, we shouldn t need evidence or logic to know who s family and who isn t. I know who the Smiths are. I ve known Beth since high school. And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend.  Sleepy Gary: Thanks, Jerry. Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off.  Rick: Look, I m not used to being this unsure for this long. I m just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. (Tries to shoot Summer)  Summer: Aah! Grandpa Rick!  Rick: (with air quotes) Hold still, \""Summer.\""  Gary: Rick, that is my daughter.  Rick: Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I ve known you for 15 years. Don t make me hurt you.  Sleepy Gary: Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with. Have you forgotten the barbecue?  Rick: Wait, why would you want me to -- You re one of them, aren t you?  Hamurai: Rick, you love those barbecues, Rick. You love them. Hai!  Amish Cyborg: Remember it, Rick?  Rick: Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this?  90s Conan?  All: Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue.  ( chatter )  Rick: You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.  Pencilvester: You re good at it, Rick.  Rick: Watch me, baby. I m like Tom Cruise from, um, \""Cuisine\"" or w-whatever that movie s called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I m like Tom Cruise from \""Cuisine.\"" ( chuckles ) Yeah. Is that what it s called? \""Cuisine\""?  Pencilvester: Wow! Hey, everybody. Let s give it up for the grill master, Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! ( all chanting \""Rick\"" )  Rick: Wait. (cut back to the present, breathing heavily ) Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It s like a \""Where s Waldo?\"" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We ll be right back after these messages.  Sleepy Gary: I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor. What do you say we take down these blast shields?  All: Yeah.  Rick: Can t do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don t know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. ( grunts )  Pencilvester: But Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff.  (Flashback)  Rick: You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They re selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They re all limited-edition \""Zelda\"" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play Nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff.  (Cut back to the present)  Rick: Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that.  Pencilvester: Don t overreact, Rick.  Jerry: Sleepy Gary, a word?  Sleepy Gary: Sure, Jerry. Rick, keep a level head, okay?  Cause I ll tell you a secret about Frankenstein -- He s actually Frankenstein s monster.  (Rick looks at Frankenstein, Frankenstein pounds his fist)  Jerry: Sleepy Gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I m convinced that you re Beth s husband and I m your friend, but if those memories can t be trusted, then...  Sleepy Gary: Jerry, just say it.  Jerry: Sleepy Gary, how do we know I m real?  Sleepy Gary: Jesus, Jerry. No, you re real. Hey, look at me. Now, I don t know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you re real, Jerry. Remember our vacation?  (Jerry flashes back: Jerry and Gary are relaxing on a boat on the coast during a sunset.)  Gary: They re filming that new Star Wars movie down the coast. Should we check it out?  Jerry: Sure. Why not?  (Gary drinks, Jerry drops his bottle. Both he and Gary reach for it and their hands meet. They look into each other s eyes.)  Gary: Maybe we ll see Chewbacca.  Jerry: I d like that.  (They begin kissing and fall out of frame onto the deck of the boat.)  Jerry: What are we doing?  (Cut back to the present)  Gerry: I don t give a damn what else happens out there. You and I are going to survive this.  Jerry: Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house.  (Transit to the living room, Rick is pointing the gun at random people)  Frankenstein: That s a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out?  Rick: Uh, no thank -- ( grunts ) Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it s suspicious that a lot of people in here can t wait to get out of here?  Frankenstein: Ah, you re paranoid, Rick. You ve been paranoid since  nam.  (Rick flashes back: Rick and Frankenstein are in Vietnam)  Rick: So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?  Frankenstein: Shi-i-i-i-t. I mma bust a -- ( cut back to the present, Rick grunts )  Rick: No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein! ( indistinct shouting ) Give it back!  All: Yeah! ( applause ) Frankenstein!  Rick: ( breathing heavily ) Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?!  Reverse Giraffe: Maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we re all real. You know me. I m reverse giraffe. I have a short neck and legs. I went to college with Hamurai.  Hamurai: Hai!  Reverse Giraffe: I saved Ghost In A Jar s life in Vietnam.  Ghost in a Jar: Boo rah!  Reverse Giraffe: And Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on?  Beth: ( sighs ) Too many.  Reverse Giraffe: Okay, so maybe we re just all fake.  Mrs. Refrigerator: That don t make no sense!  Reverse: Giraffe: Or maybe, there s only one deceiver here -- The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other.  Rick: Hey, don t blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!  Reverse Giraffe: I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years?  Morty: Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases.  (Flashback)  Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that s the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that s why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin  in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls! ( laughs ) yeah! Say that all the time.  (cut back to the present) All: ( muttering ) That s a fake-ass catchphrase right there.  Beth: And don t forget his incredibly vague back story.  Rick: Beth, I m your father!  Beth: Oh, are you, dad? Are you?  Morty: Rick, if you want to prove you re real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here!  Rick: Why don t you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer s name?  (Everybody is surprised)  Mrs. Refrigerator: In your face!  Morty: Give me the gun. (Looks at everyone else) I m not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage. ( all cheering ) All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors.  Rick: Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I m brainwashed, too.  Morty: You know, Rick, this isn t easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend.  Rick: Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!  Morty: Oh -- oh, yeah?  Rick: Yeah! I ve got about a thousand memories of your dumb little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don t you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, motherfucker! Pull the fucking trigger!  (Morty shoots Baby Wizard, Baby Wizard screeches )  Duck with Muscles: Oh, wow. Baby Wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife. (Morty shoots the duck, parasite screeches )  Rick: What the hell?  Morty: I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you re real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!  (Flashbacks of times where Rick left Morty in despair)  266a these memories that we have  266a  266a these memories that we cherish  266a  266a I wish that we... can go back... to that time  266a  266a ooh, ooh, ooh  266a  (Cut back to the present)  Rick: Holy crap, Morty, you re right.  Morty: Is -- is -- isn t that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me?  Rick: Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough. (Rick turns the dial on the washing machine, the wall draws back to reveal a set of guns)  Rick: Now let s go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. ( grunts )  (Rick shoots a parasite, everybody else screams )  Morty: Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.  Rick: We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who s got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?  Mrs Refrigerator: I-I-I-I -- everyone has bad memories of me. You remember that one time? (flashback, Beth, Jerry, Mrs. Refrigerator and a lot of other people on a roller coaster, screaming, cut back to the present) Ooh, man, we couldn t stop screaming.  Beth: Uh, roller coasters aren t bad, Mrs. Refrigerator. They re thrilling. And you ve been a perfect companion to me my entire life.  Mrs Refrigerator: The jig is up! ( whimpering ) get me out of here. Get me out of here! Aah! ( screeching ) ( all gasping ) Oh, shit!  Rick: Everybody back! If you re not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer?  Summer: Why am I always your go-to?  (Morty flashes back: Morty is hosing the backyard. Summer comes outside behind Morty and kicks him between the legs. Morty grabs his crotch and falls over in pain.)  Summer: Never go in my room again.  Morty: I didn t!  (Cut back to the present)  Morty: She s real. She s my bitch of a sister.  Summer: Nice.  (Summer flashes back: Summer walks into her parents  room wearing a dress and earrings with her hair done.)  Summer: Mom, are you driving me to --  (Summer sees that Beth is lying on the bed, drunk and holding a bottle of wine.)  Beth: Hmm? Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?  Summer: Oh, my god. Are you drunk?  Beth: (belches) (slurring) What re you, my life coach?  Summer: Your what?  (Beth rolls over to get out of bed and accidentally hits Summer in the face with the wine bottle.)  Summer: Oh! God! Oh. Oh, my gosh. Oh! God! Mom!  Beth: Sweetheart, are you okay? I didn t mean to --  Summer: I m gonna have a bruise! It s picture day!  Beth: It s not, don t overreact. I can clean it up.  Summer: (sobs) I want the police to take me!  (Cut back to the present)  Summer: Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem.  Beth: Thank you, sweetie.  Cross Teddy Bear: Beth, Beth, please!  Beth: I thought it was too good to be true that we d have compatible kidneys. (shoots the bear, parasite screeches ) ( guns cock ) ( screaming ) ( blasting ) ( screeching )  Rick: (Corners Pencilvester) Come on, man. Haven t we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything.  Pencilvester: Rick, I m Pencilvester. Listen to that name. You can t kill me.  Rick: You re right. (To Morty) Kill Pencilvester.  (Morty shoots Pencilvester, parasite screeches ) (Summer shoots Frankenstein, parasite screeches ) (Summer shooting, parasites screeching )  Tinkles: Summer, I ve always loved you!  Summer: Yep. (Shoots Tinkles, parasite screeches ) ( all gasp, Summer shoots ) ( more screeching ) (Morty shouts)  (Summer flashes back: Summer walks into the kitchen and turns on the light, and sees Morty masturbating.)  Summer: Oh, my god!  Morty: I-I-I thought you went to a concert!  Summer: We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?!  Morty: I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me!  Summer: You re not the victim here!  Morty: I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace!  Summer: Aaaaaah!  (cut back to the present, more shooting, parasites screeching )  Mr. Beauregard: Ah. Master Rick. Remember when you weren t going to shoot me? (Rick shoots Mr. Beauregard, parasite screeches )  Rick: I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan?  Ghost in a Jar: Oh, I-I get it. It s a play on \""the butler did it.\""  Rick: Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy. (shoots ghost in a jar, parasite screeches ) ( screeches )  Jerry: You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary.  Sleepy Gary: Don t worry. I have a plan. If we can get to my boat, there s a -- (Beth shoots Sleepy Gary, Gary slowly turns back into a parasite, screeches )  Jerry: No. No! Send me to Gary. I want to be with Gary.  (Beth flashes back: Jerry and Beth are running from a homeless man toward their car. Jerry makes it to the car first, gets in and locks the doors. Beth is holding groceries and tries to open the locked car door.)  Beth: Whoa. What the hell?  Jerry: Look out for that homeless guy!  Beth: Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!  Jerry: There isn t time! Just run!  Beth: ( grunts ) Get out here and help me!  Jerry: They say you shouldn t do that! Just run!  (Cut back to the present)  Beth: Ugh. Sorry, Jerry. You re real.  Jerry: ( crying ) I m a parasite!  Beth: Yeah, but you re real.  Jerry: (tries to kiss Beth)  Beth: Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary.  Jerry: Me, too.  ( Rick opens the blast shields )  Rick: From now on, let s all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone.  Jerry: This is depressing. We killed every good person in the house. We re what s left? What a family.  Rick: At least we re real, Jerry. We re real. Rikki tikki tavi!  Mr. Poopybutthole: Ooh, whee! Amen to that. Now, this little poopypants is hungry. Will somebody pass me a pork chop? ( chomping )  Mr. Poopybutthole: Huh. I-is -- is something wrong, Beth?  (Beth shoots Mr. Poopybutthole in the chest, and Mr. Poopybutthole flies into the wall bleeding and screaming, and hits the ground)  Rick: No, Beth!  Mr. Poopybutthole: Oh, fuck.  Beth: Wait, but I --  Mr. Poopybutthole: Oh, Beth! Why?!  Jerry: I need an ambulance! There s been a shooting. My wife shot... Uh, my -- my wife shot a long-time family friend.  Mr. Poopybutthole: Why?  Summer: Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr. Poopybutthole.  Beth: I-I thought --  Morty: Keep breathing!  Mr. Poopybutthole: Oh, god. What s happening?  Morty: Look at me! Look at me! Don t -- don t fall asleep!  Mr. Poopybutthole: Is -- is this what bleeding to death is? Oh, whee. Is this how I die?  Rick: Oh, geez! Oh, my god!  Mr. Poopybutthole: Why would you do this? Beth. It s not supposed to hurt. I-I thought... ( siren wails ) Ooh, whee.  (Beth runs into the kitchen and pours a glass of wine, trembling and bawling, getting wine everywhere)  [CREDITS]  (Mr. Poopybutthole is in a hospital doing physical therapy with a nurse as the family watches through a window. Beth is holding flowers.)  Beth: Oh, he -- he s looking a lot better.  Rick: Listen, Beth, don t torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.  Beth: Is, um, is he mad at me?  Rick: He s not pressing charges. I mean, that s got to be the \""you shot me\"" equivalent of not being mad.  (Nurse steps out of the room)  Beth: Can he have visitors?  Doctor: He d like to be alone. He told me to tell you he s sorry you didn t have bad memories of him? If you love him, you should leave.

When the head exclaims, \""Show me what you got,\"" Rick travels to The Pentagon to inform the President of the United States that the alien head is a [[Cromulons|Cromulon]], and it seeks a live performance of a catchy new song.  Unfortunately, an earthquake hit the Grammy Awards presentation, killing all of Earth's most famous musicians (including but not limited to Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream) with the exception of [[Ice-T]] who survived the earthquake. In desperation, Rick and Morty compose and perform the song \""Get Schwifty\"". The head is pleased and transports the entire Earth to an intergalactic musical competition, viewed by more Cromulons, where the losers' planets are obliterated. Rick then tells the President that any astronauts they had in orbit at the time are dead.  Rick and Morty team up with Ice-T to compose a new song, but Morty panics and steals Rick's portal device to save his family. Ice-T reveals himself to be a jaded alien and leaves Rick alone. Jerry, Beth, Summer and Ethan get involved with [[Headism|a religious cult]] whose beliefs are based on their interpretation of the actions of the Cromulons. Morty gets lost and traverses several portal openings, eventually stumbling onto Bird Person's world. Bird Person encourages Morty to have faith in Rick and sends him back to Earth.  General Nathan ends up losing it, betrays the president, and launches nuclear bombs at the host Cromulon as he was wanting to do the whole episode, however this barely effects him and in reply, he simply states ''<nowiki>''</nowiki>BOO, NOT COOL!<nowiki>''</nowiki>'' and he disqualify Earth, but Ice-T returns and saves the planet from annihilation. Rick and Morty, back together again, perform a new hit song, satisfy the Cromulons, and win the contest. Nathan runs at the president with an M16 after all is saved, but Rick turns him into a snake. Meanwhile, the alien head cult quickly disbands after realizing it was all just a musical reality show.  In the post-credits, Ice-T returns to his planet upon his exile and is restored to his Water-T form.

(A [[Armagheadon|giant yellow head]] flies through space toward Earth. The Earth catches fire and land masses start collapsing as the wind picks up.)  (A man takes a golf swing in the middle of the storm. A large piece of land drops out in front of him, leaving a large hole.)  Man: Hey, golf is easy now!  (The hole gets larger and the man falls in.)  Man: Aahh! Golf is hard again! Golf is hard agaaaaaaain!  (A news anchor in a raincoat, Terry, is downtown with people panicking in the background as the giant head stares blankly at Earth. A news title says  201cArmagHEADdon?! 201d.)  Terry: The view here is the same as yours, Jim. A giant head has entered Earth 2019s gravity, triggering climate change and natural disasters we thought were impossible for at least another eight years.  Jim: (in news studio) Let 2019s not make this political, Terry. Do we know what this giant head wants?  (Giant Head clears its throat, creating a large wind blast)  Giant Head: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.  (winds pick up and the tides change rapidly with its speech)  Terry: Jim, you heard *static* said,  201cShow me what you got. 201d  Giant Head: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT. I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU GOT. (lamp post falls over, Terry runs out of frame)  (Rick turns off the TV, they are on the couch)  [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]: Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.  [[Morty Smith|Morty]]: Uhh, where?  (Rick puts on sunglasses)  Rick: The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon. *burp* The lame one, here on Earth.  (Rick and Morty walk out of frame)  [INTRO]  (At the house, winds still blow strongly. Summer, Beth and Jerry are standing outside.)  [[Summer Smith|Summer]]: Is it God? If it 2019s God, do we get out of school?  [[Beth Smith|Beth]]: It 2019s not God, Summer.  [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]]: She 2019s allowed to think it 2019s God if she wants, honey!  Beth: Shut up, Jerry.  Jerry: Ok 2026  (Rick and Morty pull out of the garage in the ship.)  Beth: Dad, what do you know about this?  Rick: Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.  (they fly off)  (Mr. Goldenfold arrives on a moped.)  [[Mr. Goldenfold]]: Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky. Hi, I 2019m Morty 2019s math teacher. I 2019m also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together.  Beth: How is praying going to help?  Mr. Goldenfold: Ma 2019am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers? Let 2019s be rational! I 2019ll see you at God 2019s house! (leaves)  (Pentagon war room, everyone is arguing)  [[The President|President]]: Gentlemen, gentlemen, one at a time! Simon?  [[Simon]]: SETI, NORAD, and every broadcaster on the planet are attempting to show this being what humanity 2019s got. String theory, world history, the human genome.  (Nathan slams fist on table)  [[General Nathan|Nathan]]: Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what America 2019s got is 70,000 megatons of KABOOM-BOOM! And I say we show it right up this floating head 2019s ass!  (Argument begins again. A portal appears and Rick and Morty step through.)  Guards: Hold it! Don 2019t move! (they approach Rick and Morty with guns)  Rick: Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!  (Guards stop and look at Nathan for approval. Nathan nods at them, and the guards aim. A laser fires at the guards and they disappear, leaving only snakes.)  President: Stand down. Everybody stand down! I 2019m the leader of these people and I 2019m unarmed. There 2019s no need for any more snake-makery.  Rick: My name is Rick Sanchez. This here 2019s my grandson Morty. (drinks from flask)  Everyone: Hi, Morty.  Morty: Hey.  Rick: I 2019ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we 2019ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math. (points to viewscreen showing floating head) This head won 2019t go away until *burp* Earth shows them it 2019s got a hit song.  Everyone: Seriously, that 2019s impossible, etc 2026  Simon: You mean like Vivaldi?  Rick: No,   Frasier  . A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.  President: All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream. (no one responds) The-Dream? He wrote  201cUmbrella 201d and  201cSingle Ladies 201d? You people haven 2019t heard of The-Dream?  Rick: You 2019re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.  Nathan: How do you know about that?  President: For God 2019s sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps.  Aide: Sir! Pharrell, Newman, Corgan, and that Dream guy. They 2019re all dead.  President: What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them?  Aide: The Grammys, sir. There was an earthquake and all the musicians... (sniffs, holding back tears) All the famous ones, they 2019re gone.  President: Dear God.  Aide: Hold on, sir, just a minute. Ice-T survived. He 2019s inbound on an F-15, ETA two hours.  Rick: Good luck, Mr. President.  Simon: Sir, the magnetic poles are about to reverse. In two hours, there may not be an Earth to save.  (Rick opens a portal)  President: Sanchez! Are you a musician?  Rick: I dabble, Mr. President.  President: Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.  (At the church, everyone is panicking.)  [[Father Bob]]: People! Everyone! Remain calm! Every crisis of faith is an opportunity for more faith! When God deals you an 11, you don 2019t fold! You double down, and always hit on a soft 16. That means you, Jews.  [[Jew]]: I beg your pardon, pastor, but the last I looked outside, it seems to be you that 2019s been dealt the weak hand. Jews rule! (no one responds) Nobody? Ok, tough church.  [[Gene Vagina|Principal Vagina]]: Hi, Principal Vagina. The name 2019s real, possibly Scandinavian. I 2019m just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. Fuck all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky.  (everyone reacts)  Principal Vagina: Ah, di di di di. (to Bob) Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this (holds up a necklace with a cross) can beat that 2026 what have you done for me lately? (tosses necklace to Bob) So if you wanna excuse me, I 2019m going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the fucking weather! (walks out) Outta my way!  Pastor Bob: Ok, if sanity 2019s been restored to this assembly, I 2019d like to talk about the cost of repairing our new organ. Sally, the plate, please.  Mr. Goldenfold: (holds up a dollar) Ohhhh, this is my favorite part!  (Helicopters over the desert, subtitle  201cNevada Desert: Restricted Air Space 201d. Rick and Morty are on a helicopter)  Morty: Rick, are you really a musician?  Rick: Who 2019s NOT a musician, Morty?  Morty: Me!  Rick: Yeah, not with that attitude.  Jump Master: We 2019re in the drop zone! I 2019m the jump master! My name 2019s Jamey! With an E-Y! Go, go, go! (Rick slides down rope)  Morty: B-b-but we don 2019t have a song!  (Outside the church, Principal Vagina is on the sidewalk on his knees)  Principal Vagina: Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we 2019ve done. We 2019re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone.  (At Area 51 speaker system, Rick and Morty slide down rope out of helicopter)  Rick and Morty: WhooooOOOOAHHHH!!!!  (They land on a stage with various live performance equipment on it. The yellow Cromulon is in front of the stage staring.)  Rick: (picks up a microphone) All right, Morty, let 2019s get ready to do it! Why don 2019t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?  Morty: Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!  Rick: Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!  Morty: Oh man, ok, all right, um 2026  (Morty presses a key and a beat starts, Rick knocks over a mic stand and starts  201csinging 201d)      Rick: Ahhhhh yeahhhhh      Ya gotta get schwifty      (Morty starts beating a tambourine in rhythm)      Ya gotta get schwifty in here      It 2019s time to get schwifty    <br /> (The President and Nathan are watching the performance on a screen inside)  Nathan: Get 2026 schwifty? What the hell is that?  President: It 2019s our world 2019s best effort, that 2019s what.      Rick: Take off your pants and your panties      Shit on the floor      Time to get schwifty in here      I 2019m Mr. Bulldops       <br />    Nathan: Mr. Bulldops?  President: Don 2019t analyze it, Nathan. It 2019s working!      Rick: Take a shit on the floor      Time to get schwifty in here      (Weather starts to die down around the world)  (At the church)  Pastor Bob: And third-level donors get our all access family pass.  Summer: Listen! The storm is stopping!  (On the stage)      Rick: Hey, take your pants off      It 2019s schwifty time today    (song ends)    Giant Head: Hmmmm.  (everyone at Area 51 waits in anticipation)  (at the church)  Principal Vagina: Please be kind to us for we are but tiny things with entire bodies stuck to your ground.  (at the stage)  Giant Head: I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT. GOOD JOB.  (Giant Head flies away)  (everyone at Area 51 cheers and celebrates)  (at the church, everyone lifts Principal Vagina,  201cWhat do you know, he was right! Hooray Principal Vagina! 201d)  Beth: Now hold on a second, let 2019s be rational about this.  (everyone stops and stares at Beth)  Beth: No, I 2019m 2026 I 2019m just saying, we don 2019t know if there 2019s a cause-effect relationship --  (earthquake hits, Beth falls on ground)  Beth: Oh, God, what 2019s going on now?  (at the stage, Rick and Morty and Area 51 panic)  (The Earth is surrounded by an energy field and disappears. Earth reappears in another galaxy with four other planets, a disco ball-like sun, and several different-colored Cromulons looking at Earth.)  (At Area 51)  President: What the hell happened?  Aide: Mr. President, you 2019re gonna wanna see this.  Rick: I think planet Earth has just been transported.  (At the church)  Principal Vagina: The head has left and sent its children!  Beth: Holy CRAP!  (everyone gets on their knees)  Summer: Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again!  (everyone starts murmuring prayers)  (At Area 51)  Simon: Sir, we 2019ve started picking up on a garbled signal. We 2019re decrypting it now.  (screen gradually descrambles)  (Screen shows different bands of different aliens on different stages. Dance music plays in the background as the Cromulon narrates.)  Cromulon: WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WE 2019LL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. [[Planet Music|PLANET MUSIC]]! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray.  Rick: Uhh, it 2019s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.       ACT 2     (dance music plays, Planet Music opening shows)  Cromulon: Welcome back to Planet Music! First up, let 2019s hear the latest song from planet [[Parblesnops]]. The [[Greebybobes]]! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.  Greebybobe: Hold it, hold it, stop! Music isn 2019t about competition or captivity! If you love music, you love freedom. Let these worlds be free, please!  Cromulon: DISQUALIFIED!  (plasma ray powers up and fires at the planet, blowing it up)  Cromulon: There 2019s one every season. Moving on to planet [[Arbolez Meterosos]]. [[Arbolian Menterososians|Arbolian Meterososians]]. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.  Arbolian Meterososian: Ah two, three, four 2026  (The Arbolian Meterososians play a very simple and underwhelming song while looking at the Cromulons for approval.)  (At Area 51. Rick, Morty and [[Ice-T]] are in a studio with several instruments. Rick is playing a bass, Morty is poking at a keyboard, and Ice-T is in the corner. The aide comes in.)  Aide: Rick, Morty, Ice-T. The timetable 2019s moved up. Earth 2019s on in six hours.  Morty: Like we 2019re not already under enough pressure! (Morty flips a bowl of peanuts at the aide and it hits him in the head. The aide leaves.)  Rick and Ice-T: Whoa ho ho ho ho!  Rick: Geez, Morty. The guy 2019s just doing his job. Take it easy.  Morty: Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We 2019ve got six hours to come up with a song!  Rick: Genius happens in the moment, Morty. (walks over to keyboard)  Morty: Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?  Rick: That 2019s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning. (presses a button on the keyboard) Balls.  (Morty walks toward the [[portal gun]])  Rick: Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There 2019s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we 2019re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?  Morty: What?!  Rick: Yeah, *burp* you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities, *burp* Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can 2019t get schwifty.  Morty: Stop saying it like it 2019s a thing! You made it up!  Rick: Hey, Morty! Could you lick my 2026 (Rick presses keys on the keyboard with the sample of him saying  201cBalls 201d)  (The President, Nathan, and his aide are watching them through a window)  Morty: Rick, cut it out! That 2019s not funny, Rick!  Nathan: I 2019ve seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.  President: And what 2019s your plan, General?  Nathan: We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky.  President: Our planet 2019s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, I 2019ll put mine in Rick and Morty.  201cGet Schwifty 201d was a jam.  (in field outside church, everyone is dressed in robes wearing head hats. Principal Vagina is holding a homemade satellite on a stick with an earbud)  Principal Vagina: Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says he 2019s proud of what we 2019re doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!  All: Happy Ascension!  (Jerry is holding an ice cream cone, Beth looks unimpressed.)  Beth: We should pack up and leave town now.  Jerry: I think it 2019s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you 2019d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.  (Summer arrives wearing a head hat, holding two head hats. Beth double-facepalms.)  Jerry: Whoa! Look at you! You 2019re wearing the hat and everything!  Summer: Here 2019s yours! (puts hat on Jerry) Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?  Beth: Yeah, sure. Wait, what??  Summer: I love you guys. You gave me life. And it 2019s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.  Beth: Dinner sounds nice.  (Ethan arrives.)  [[Ethan]]: Pardon, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Summer, are you coming to the Ascension?  Summer: Father, can we please go to the Ascension?  Jerry: Sure! Let 2019s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?  (Three people are each tied to a bunch of balloons, tethered to a stake in the ground. One is labeled  201cThief 201d, another labeled  201cGoth 201d, and the third labeled  201cMovie Talker 201d.)  Principal Vagina: We hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies! (cuts first rope) Headward, free now to rise. (cuts second rope) Headward, free now to rise. (cuts third rope) Headward, free now to rise.  Summer: Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!  (in the studio)  Ice-T: A squeegee comes up from the garage, right? And he 2019s got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. He 2019s like,  201cI 2019m ready! 201d  (Rick and Ice-T laugh)  Ice-T: Who would take a lobster to see Iron Man 3?  (Rick and Ice-T laugh)  Ice-T: Aw, damn. We 2019re out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway.  Rick: Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!  (Rick grabs the portal gun, hits a couple buttons, makes a portal in the floor and drops through it. Another portal appears in the ceiling and Rick drops out of it with several snacks.)  Morty: What?!  Ice-T: Damn. You didn 2019t tell me you fuck around with portals and shit.  Morty: That 2019s it!  (Morty grabs the portal gun and gets up.)  Rick: Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!  Morty: You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!  Rick: Morty, just put it down. You don 2019t know what you 2019re doing.  (Morty turns to a wall and fires a portal.)  Morty: I 2019m going to go find Mom and Dad.  Rick: Nooooo!  (Morty jumps through the portal and Rick tries to grab him, but the portal closes.)  Rick: Ahhhh, shit!  President: Ah, shit.  (Morty steps through different portals to different worlds, ending up in Buttworld.)  Morty: Ahhh, shit.  (Outside of the Smiths 2019 home, Summer, Beth and Jerry are hoeing the front yard.)  Summer: And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!  Jerry and Beth: Praise be the 2026  Jerry: Yeah.  (Principal Vagina arrives on a bicycle with a seat, bell ringing.)  Principal Vagina: Hi folks, Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. It 2019s 6 p.m., so if you 2019re a parent, you 2019re now entitled to adoration from your children.  Summer: I 2019m going to start dinner! (walks into the house)  Beth: I don 2019t know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.  Jerry: She 2019s aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become.  (Someone tied to balloons floats by in the background with label  201cInappropriate Joke Teller 201d.)  Beth: She 2019s not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew 2026  Balloon Man: Please help me! You can reach me if you try. Please help me!!  Beth: That 2019s not our business as long as Summer is thriving!  (Inside the Smiths 2019 house, Summer serves dinner at the table.)  Summer: Taco time! (Summer pulls off the lid to reveal exactly 12 tacos.) I hope it pleases you as the head desires.  Beth: That 2019s wonderful, Summer!  Jerry: We 2019re so proud of you. But honestly, you don 2019t have to make dinner every night.  Summer: Of course I do, silly! (gasps and drops lid) Oh my God, daddy, I 2019m sorry I called you silly! I 2019m so sorry! (turns around and drops to knees) Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them!  (Summer sulks out of the dining room and up the stairs.)  (Morty stumbles out of a portal on a green world and collapses to the ground holding the portal gun. A figure looms over Morty, pokes him with a stick, then rolls him over.)  [[Birdperson]]: Morty.  Morty: Birdperson?  Birdperson: You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing.  (In the studio, Rick plays with the keyboard and Ice-T is in the corner on his phone.)  Rick: Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.  Ice-T: Shit. Over-developed, under-developed. Bad songs are bad songs.  Rick: Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or 2026 ?  Ice-T: Ah, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I can 2019t afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what I 2019m sayin 2019?  Rick: Ice, I don 2019t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but *burp* if Morty doesn 2019t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it 2019s, uh, kind of your problem too.  Ice-T: Pfff. I ain 2019t worried about no Earth blowin 2019 up, man.  Rick: What? Why not?  Ice-T: Yo, this is why.  (Ice-T transforms into a floating ice shard with the same face.)  Rick: What the fuck? You can turn into ice?  Ice-T: My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of [[Alphabetrium]]. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don 2019t care if it blows up! Cause I 2019ll just be ice, floatin 2019 through space, like a comet!  Rick: Take it from me, Ice. *burp* You can 2019t just *burp* float around space not caring about stuff forever.  Ice-T: Pshhhh. Man, watch me. Good luck, Rick.  (Ice-T blasts out of the ceiling of the studio.)  President: Ok, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to  201cget schwifty. 201d  Nathan: Oh, for God 2019s sake, that 2019s enough.  (Nathan pulls a gun on the President)  President: What the hell are you doing, Nathan? I 2019m the goddamn President of the United fuckin 2019 States!  Nathan: I 2019m setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into Earth 2019s performance. And you, Mr. President, I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun!  President: Wait, wait, wait, why-why --  (Nathan pistol-whips the President and he falls to the ground.)  (At Birdperson 2019s residence, Birdperson serves Morty a bowl of food and tinkers with the portal gun.)  Birdperson: I believe I can access the history of Rick 2019s gun and help you get back to him.  Morty: But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?  Birdperson: Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.  Morty: All of Rick 2019s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?  Birdperson: It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don 2019t know what humans eat.  (Tammy arrives wearing a bathrobe.)  [[Tammy]]: You know what THIS human eats!  Birdperson: Don 2019t be gross, Tammy.  Tammy: (leans over to Morty and whispers) Bird 2026 dick.  Morty: Tammy 2026 gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn 2019t care about anyone but himself. He doesn 2019t think about the consequences of anything he does.  Birdperson: And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason I 2019m alive at all.  (Birdperson points to a wall of photos of himself and Rick together. Last shown is Rick holding a baby.)  Morty: What 2019s that? Who 2019s that baby?  Birdperson: Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick?  (Morty stands in thought for a moment. Planet Music starts back up on the TV.)  Cromulon: That was Chunky Tunk with  201cFull Ming Mong, Empty Gorp Dorp. 201d Up next, planet Earth!  Morty: Oh God! We 2019re up?!?!  (At the church, Principal Vagina and other priests are talking with Jerry and Beth.)  Principal Vagina: Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what Headism has to offer the world.  Beth: The world?  Principal Vagina: Headism is a hit. We 2019re taking it worldwide and would like Jerry to be our church 2019s  201cHead 201d of Advertising.  Jerry: You 2026 would?  Principal Vagina: Beth, we 2019d like to promote you from horse surgeon, straight past human surgeon, to  201cHead 201d of Medicine.  Beth: That 2019s my dream! That 2019s my dream.  Jerry: Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh 2026 we can 2019t.  Beth: Absolutely not.  Principal Vagina: I 2019m sorry?  Beth: We 2019ve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be  201cour 201d daughter, not this person she 2019s become.  Jerry: We 2019ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion. (turns and puts his hands on Beth 2019s shoulders) And you know what? I 2019m sick of pretending that we 2019re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you 2019re the love of my life!  Beth: (puts her hands on Jerry 2019s sides) And I 2018m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!  (Cut: Summer has tied Beth and Jerry to ropes and balloons outside.)  Beth: Please don 2019t do this, please don 2019t do this! Summer!  Jerry: Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don 2019t know what to do with it and it hurts.  Summer: You 2019re going to be ok! (ties another balloon to them) You will come back as babies!  Jerry: I AM a baby! I 2019m a baby NOW!  (In the now empty studio, a portal opens up and Morty steps through.)  Morty: Hello? Is anybody here? (looks through the studio window and sees the President tied up) Mr. President!  (Morty darts out of the studio to the President and unties him. The President climbs up to the console and presses a button)  President: This is Bluebird. Code tango-niner-alpha. Abort launch. Abort! Hello? (releases button) He 2019s blocked me out.  Morty: Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!  President: It won 2019t matter how schwifty you get, Morty. The General 2019s got nukes set to launch halfway through Earth 2019s song!  Morty: Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?  President: Can the Pope 2019s dick fit through a donut?  Morty: Uhhh, I 2019m not sure?  President: Exactly!  (On the stage, Rick stands before the Cromulons.)  Cromulon: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.  Rick: Ahem. (starts a low-key, bouncy song) Uhhh 2026 lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts.  (Outside the church, Principal Vagina is preparing to cut Beth and Jerry loose. The Cromulons  faces become angry.)  Principal Vagina: Headward free now to rise!  Mr. Goldenfold: Hey! Look at the heads! Looks like the heads are gettin 2019 angry!  (In the desert, the President flies the helicopter clumsily to the stage with Morty in tow.)  President: I 2019m really bad at this, Morty! There are way too many buttons on this thing!  Morty: Mr. President, if I 2019ve learned one thing today, it 2019s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!  (On the stage, Rick continues his song.)  Rick: Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups 2026 ooh, tough crowd.  (Outside the church, Principal Vagina is preparing to cut Beth and Jerry loose.)  Principal Vagina: I 2019m sure that has 2026 that has nothing to do with this.  (Principal Vagina cuts the rope and the Cromulons immediately start booing.)  Summer: The heads are displeased! (She jumps and grabs Beth and Jerry 2019s legs.)  Ethan: Summer! (He jumps and grabs her.)  (On the stage Rick continues his song as the Blackhawk arrives. Morty and the President slide down ropes out of the helicopter onto the stage.)  Rick: Morty!  (The Cromulons begin cheering with  201cYay! 201d and  201cHooray! 201d etc. with smiles on their faces. The now unmanned helicopter crashes off frame.)  (Outside the church, Summer and Ethan are pulling Beth and Jerry down to the ground.)  Mr. Goldenfold: The heads love this! They love it when we DON 2019T kill the Smith family!  (The balloons are released, but Beth and Jerry are still tied up.)  Principal Vagina: No! Stop that! You 2019re not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!  (On the stage, the President grabs the microphone and speaks to the control room staff.)  President: Call off the nuclear strike! This is the President. Stop the nuclear missile launch!  Nathan: Just launch the missiles!  (Nathan smashes a button and two nuclear missiles emerge from the ground in the desert. The Cromulons watch as the missiles fly toward the yellow Cromulon and lay puny explosions on its chin.)  Cromulon: BOO! NOT COOL!  (Outside the church)  Principal Vagina: I 2019m the only one that speaks to the heads!  (Cromulon zooms in close to Earth)  Cromulon: DISQUALIFIED!  Mr. Goldenfold: The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him!  (The mob runs toward Principal Vagina. The Cromulon zooms closer.)  (On the stage)  Cromulon: DISQUALIFIED! DISQUALIFIED!  (The plasma ray points toward Earth and begins powering up. The control room staff evacuates. The plasma ray heads right for the stage but something flies in the way and blocks it.)  All: Ice-T?  (Ice-T slowly crumbles from the plasma ray 2019s power)  Ice-T: That 2019s right, it 2019s me, Ice-T! I care now! You made me care more! With all due respect, I 2019d like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play.  Morty: What do you say, Rick?  Rick: I say 2026 (grabs mic) Let 2019s do it!  (Morty presses a button on the keyboard and a different beat starts playing. The heads start with  201cHooray 201d etc while smiling. Rick claps over his head and Morty dances a little.)  Rick: All right!  Morty: Ohhhh yeahhhh!  Rick: Come on, here we go!  Morty: Ohhhh yeahhhh!  Rick: Say it with me!      All: Head bent over      Raised up posterior      Head bent over (ahh yeah)      Raised up posterior      (Outside the church, Principal Vagina is ties up with balloons and rope. A different person cuts the rope. Vagina sees the heads smiling as he rises.)  Principal Vagina: Ohhh my GOOOOODDDD!!!    (On the stage)    All: Head bent over (yeah)      Raised up posterior (oh yeah)      Head bent over (oh yeah)      (Raised up posterior!)      Cromulon: After 988 seasons of Planet Music, the Cromulons have decided to declare Earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. Goodbye!  (Earth is transported back to the right place.)  All: Yeah, we did it!  (Outside the church, everyone is still and silent.)  Mr. Goldenfold: Did he just say  201cmusical reality show 201d?  Jerry: Yeah, it 2019s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren 2019t actually related at all.  (Principal Vagina floats by in the background.)  Principal Vagina: HEEEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!  Beth: We should go get him.  (At Area 51, everyone is celebrating. The President shakes hands with Morty.)  President: I hope I can call on you again if we need you, Morty.  Morty: Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?  (The President waves over Secret Service.)  President: Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we 2019ll deny it and probably worse.  (A Secret Service agent grabs Morty 2019s phone and snaps it in half.)  Morty: Understood.  (Nathan runs toward them with a gun.)  Nathan: DIIIIEEEE!!!!  (He is hit with an energy blast from Rick and disappears.)  President: Why didn 2019t he turn into a snake?  Rick: Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch 2026 snake holster on the leg.  (He pulls up his pant leg to reveal a holster which a snake crawls out of. The snake slithers away and a soldier whistles impressed. The President begins laughing and hugs Rick.)  President: I love this man!  [CREDITS]  (On Alphabetrium, Ice-T enters a great hall containing his elders: a grey J, a gaseous F with a female face, and a Q made of lava. All three are holding different scepters.)  Ice-T: Magnesium-J, Hydrogen-F. Father.  Magnesium-J: Word of your selfless acts on the Earth planet have travelled across the galaxy.  Ice-T: I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.  Magnesium-J: Very well. Your exile ends today!  (All three press their scepters on the ground and the scepters glow. The beams form another beam that hits Ice-T and transforms him into a letter T made of water.)  Magnesium-J: Welcome home... Water-T.  (The hall shakes and begins falling apart.)  Purple-P: The [[Numbericons]]! They 2019re attacking!  Magnesium-J: Battle stations!  (A piece of the building falls on Magma-Q. Water-T runs over to him.)  Water-T: Father!  Magma-Q: I love you son. I should have never turned you to ice. (He dies.)  (Water-T produces a pistol on each T-end and begins walking out.)  Magnesium-J: Water-T, where are you going? There 2019s too many of them!  (A dramatic zoom to Water-T 2019s face.)  Water-T: Then I better crunch the numbers.  (Water-T bursts out of the door shooting at several Numbericons. The frame freezes mid-action and we hear gunshots and screaming. A title appears:  201cThis summer: Water-T And The Rise Of The Numbericons. 201d)  [END]  "

W-what s wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something?     Rick:    Quantum carburettor? Jesus Morty; you can t just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, it looks like something s wrong with the microverse battery - we re going to have to go inside.     Morty:    Uhm. Go inside what?     Rick:    The   battery   Morty. Be right back Summer; stay put, don t touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y.     Summer:    Wait! You can t leave me here!     Rick:    You ll be fine.

Rick:    Morty, remember eight seconds ago when -burp- when you said  go inside what  and I said  the battery  and then we showed up here?     Rick   : Morty, remember eight seconds ago when [Burps] when you said, \""Go inside what?\"" And I said, \""The battery\""? And then we showed up here, and I wasn t like, \""Whoa, this is unexpected. This is not what I was expecting, Morty. What a perplexing mystery this is.\""     Morty   : All right, all right. We re inside the battery. I get it. You don t have to bust my balls.     Rick   : Huh, this isn t right. This pipe s supposed to be sending 20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty.  [Computer beeps]     Rick   : Instead we ve got... zero? Now what are these people doing?     Morty   : W-w-w-whoa, people? [Groans]     Rick   : It s time for some hands-on engine repair.All right, Morty, hold on to something.     Morty   : Whoa!     Morty   : Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something.     Rick   : Thanks, Morty. I m pretty proud of this bad boy. Check it out.  [Keypad beeps]     Rick   : I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff. 00a0     Morty   : You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That s slavery.     Rick   : It s society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power. 00a0     Morty   : That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.     Rick   : Ooh-la-la, someone s gonna get laid in college.     Anchor   : It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano. But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let s find out.     Morty   : You need to tell these people they re in a battery, Rick. It s messed up. There s caterers down there. Th-th-they re setting up chafing dishes.     Rick   : Would you relax, Morty? There s nothing dishonest about what we re doing. Now slap on these antennae. These people need to think we re aliens.     Morty   : What? Why?     Rick   : Obviously [burps] you really [burps] know nothing about car repair.  [Fanfare plays]     Rick   : Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down.  [Cheering]     Rick   : Greetings!  [Creatures chanting, \""Rick! Rick!\""]     Rick   : Morty, you got to flip them off. I told them it means \""Peace among worlds.\"" How hilarious is that?  [Creatures cheering wildly]     Rick   : Coming through. Two real aliens walking through here.     Mr.President:    Rick, our alien friend.     Rick   : Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn t help but notice that you were having problems generating power.     Mr.President   : That s correct. [Chuckles] We ve evolved. Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete. 00a0     Rick   : [Straining] I would love to see it.     Mr.President   : Fuck you.     Rick   : What did you say to me?!     Mr.President   : \""Fuck you.\"" Y-you told me it means \""much obliged\"".     Rick   : Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me.     Mr.President   : No, no, no. Blow me.     Mr.President:    Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars.     Zeep   : I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11. Fix it or it s your ass. Chris, I m in the middle of something.     Mr.President:    Zeep, is Rick-- The alien. Rick the alien. Rick the alien...     Rick   : Really? You re gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization. Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school.     Zeep   : I dropped out of school. It s not a place for smart people.     Morty   : Ohhhh, snap!     Rick   : Listen to me, you arrogant little--     Mr.President:    [Chuckling] R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source. I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep.     Zeep   : Fine. It s hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power. I call it a miniverse.     Rick   : [Coughs] Dumb [coughs] name.     Zeep   : Excuse me?     Rick   : [Clears throat] Nothing. I mean, it s hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside?     Zeep   : This isn t a fucking chocolate factory. I don t have time.     Mr.President:    Didn t you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world?     Zeep   : Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that. Great president. All right, let s go.     Morty   : Whoa-oh!     Zeep   : Hold on to something. I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed. I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank.\t\t     Zeep   : What they don t know is that 80% of every crank s energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us. No more gooble boxes.     Rick   : I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you re doing here is unethical. It s not cool.\t\t     Morty   : What?!     Rick   : Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away [burps] making your power. I mean, that s what I call slavery.     Zeep   : No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then--     Rick   : 00a0 Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps.     Zeep   : Eek barba dirkle, somebody s gonna get laid in college.     Morty   : Rick, a word?     Morty   : What the hell was that?\t\t\t\t     Rick   : I know. \""Eek barba dirkle\""? That s a pretty fucked up \""ooh-la-la\"".     Morty   : No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here?     Rick   : Holy crap. You re right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there s got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep s flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he ll realize what a hypocrite he s being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that motherfucking ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up. 00a0     Rick   : Wh-wh-why are you making that face? 00a0     Morty   : Holy shit!     Zeep   : It s me. I ve convinced the people of this planet that I m a traveler from another world. 00a0     Rick   : You don t think that s over[Burps]doing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind. You know what? I shouldn t be so critical. I m an alien.     Zeep   : Places, please. We re about to land.\t\t\t\t     Rick   : [Coughs] Too fast.  [Sirens wailing]     Summer   : [Whimpering]     Ship   : Law enforcement converging on location. Keep Summer safe.     Summer   : No! No, no! Don t hurt anybody!     Ship   : [Warble] Confirm custom defense protocol-- Keep Summer safe-- No physical force. 00a0     Summer   : Yes.     Ship   : Processing.     Swat Officer 1   : Come out of the vehicle with your hands in the air!     Ship   : Scanning assailants. [Warbling, beeping] Psychological option detected. [Beeping] Gestating.     Summer   : \""Gestating\""?     Swat Officer 1   : Come out with your hands up, or we will be forced to open fire!     Swat Officer 1   : Incoming!     Swat Officer 2   : We got a device!     Swat Officer 1   : Bomb! Bomb!     Kid   : Daddy?     Swat Officer 1   : Oh, my God. [Sighs] Hunter?\t\t\t     Kid   : Daddy?\t\t     Summer   : What the hell?\t     Swat Officer 1   : [Gasps] Jesus Christ, cease fire! Stay back! H-h-hunter?     Kid   : Daddy.     Swat Officer 1:    Hunter! [Sobbing] Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter. Oh, my boy. My boy. I m sorry. I m sorry. It was all my fault. I m sorry.   <nowiki/>        Kid   : Daddy, leave the car alone.\t     Swat Officer 1   : W-w-w-what?     Kid   : [Distorted] Leave the car alone.\t\t     Swat Officer 1:    Hunter?\t\t     Swat Officer 1   : Don t--\t\t\t\t     Summer   : Oh, my God.     Swat Officer 1   : Stay here, Hunter! No! [Sobbing] God, no! Hunter!\t\t     Ship   : All of you have loved ones. All can be returned. All can be taken away. Please step away from the vehicle. Keep Summer safe.     Zeep   : And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements.\t\t\t\t  Rick: Hey, uh, let me ask you something.\t\t     Teenyverse President   : Yes?\t\t  Rick: Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?\t\t     Teenyverse President   : All of them. That s their job.\t  Rick: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise. Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?\t\t     Teenyverse President   : How do you know about that? It s top secret.\t\t\t     Zeep   : So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough. [Laughs] Crank it. I told them this means \""Peace among worlds\"".

Kyle   : It s not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I ll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank. But what they won t know is--     Zeep   : You ll be taking most of their energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.     Rick   : [Burps] It s show [Burps]time.     Zeep   : You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete? This is wrong, Kyle. What you re doing is wrong. You re basically-- This is slavery. You re talking about creating a planet of slaves.\t\t\t\t     Rick   : [Burps] Told you, Zeep.\t\t\t\t\t     Kyle   : Oh, they won t be slaves. They ll work for each other and pay each other money.\t     Zeep   : That just sounds like slavery with ex... tra... steps.\t\t\t\t     Rick   : What? 00a0     Zeep   : Wait a minute. Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse?\t\t\t\t\t     Rick   : Microverse!\t\t     Kyle   : Uh, teenyverse.\t\t\t\t\t     Rick   : Ugh!

And that guy made a universe. And that s the universe where I was born. Where my father died. Where I couldn t make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe.\t\t\t\t\t     Rick   : I made you!     Morty   : [Laughs] Yeah. Science, huh? Ain t it a thing.\t\t\t\t     Morty   : You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She s a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know? Because she-- she ll-- She bucks pretty hard. Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no!

When I get out of this teenyverse, I m gonna smash it to pieces with you in it.     Rick   : Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I m gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what?\t     Morty   : Don t make things worse, Rick! Uh, he s not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car. 00a0     Zeep   : That s what you used my universe for? To run your car?     Rick   : Yeah, but don t flatter yourself. There s always AAA, you fucking cocksucker!     Rick   : What s he doing? What s he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality!     Rick   : You crafty son of a--     Zeep   : Ow! I crafted the guy that created the planet you re standing on!     Rick   : Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother s ovaries!     Zeep   : I didn t ask to be born!     Morty   : All right, that s it! I m out. I-I m gonna go into the wilderness, and I m gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can t be worse than this.     Rick   : Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you.     Morty   : That s a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?     Rick   : It s a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture. And it certainly can t be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights!  [Sirens wailing]     Army General:    Go, go, go!     Summer   : Oh, my God. Oh, God. What are we going to do now?     Ship   : I am unable to destroy this army. To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army, but you will not permit it.     Summer   : Correct.     Ship   : You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures.     Summer   : If you re talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that.     Ship   : [Warble] Confirmed.

You re leading the tree people? Huh. That s a step up.     Morty   : We have no leaders. We follow only the will of the forest.     Rick   : Ooh. Wow. Gaaaaay.     Zeep   : That is pretty gay.     Morty   : You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing. Come with me into the forest. There is something I wish to teach you.     Morty   : This is Ku ala, the spirit tree. For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the fuck out of here. These people are backwards savages. They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger. Everyone s gross, and they all smell like piss all the time. I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop. I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day!     Morty   : Look, I don t care what it takes. You two are putting aside your bullshit, and you re working together to get us back home.     Rick   : No can do, Morty. I just can t.     Zeep   : I just don t see how I can--     Morty   : Ro ro dah no gah! You re smart. You ll figure it out.  [Guns cocking]     Army General:    You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship! 10, 9...

That s where the transporter is, too, so why don t we come with?     Zeep   : It s cool. I ll be back in a sec.     Rick   : You know how long a second can take in a microverse?     Rick   : Oh! Run, Morty! That asshole s willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He s psychotic!  [Both pant]     Rick   : Morty, hop on my back.     Morty   : Why?

We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption. Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs.     Soldier   : What do we do about the space car?     Human President:    Leave it alone.

Morty responds, after thinking for a moment, that one of the lunch ladies was found dead, her body drained of blood and marked by two holes in her neck. Beth's horror, as she has no idea how such a horrible thing could happen, is quickly quenched by a nonchalant Rick, who reveals that vampires are real; the revelation horrifies Summer, but Rick casually tells her that humanity has known of their existence for hundreds of years. Terrified of the possibility of being killed by a vampire, Summer desperately asks to grandpa Rick if he could go to their school by transferring his consciousness into the body of a teenager, which Rick considers a stupid idea and insults Summer for it. Beth tries to get Jerry to support Summer, but Jerry is too distracted by his tablet to pay attention, leading to a conflict. Rick grows tired of their fights and declares that he will take them to off-planet therapy to fix their relationship.  At school Morty and Summer discuss how best to deal with the vampire issue when they are greeted by \""[[Tiny Rick]]\"": Rick decided to help them out by putting himself into high-school aged clone of himself temporarily. After killing the vampire (who as it turns out was [[Coach Feratu]]), Tiny Rick heads home to transfer his mind into the older Rick's body, which is stored in a vat in the garage. However, Summer gets a text from [[Toby Matthews]] asking if they could have a party at the Smith house, but wants to have Tiny Rick there as well. Tiny Rick decides to stay in his younger body to let Morty and Summer have a party. At the party Tiny Rick performs a song on his guitar, the lyrics of which sound like desperate pleas from the older Rick to get him out of Tiny Rick's body, but nobody notices except Summer, who realizes something odd is happening. Tiny Rick quickly becomes popular with the rest of the school, in turn increasing Morty and Summer's social standing, but Summer becomes increasingly worried that Rick has become trapped in his young body. Morty initially ignores her as Jessica has begun talking to him as a direct result of Tiny Rick, but his suspicions are raised when Rick's dance solo at the school dance includes lyrics practically begging someone to help him return to his old body. Unwilling to let this continue, Summer hides the wooden stakes they used to kill Coach Feratu in Tiny Rick's locker, resulting in his expulsion. Tiny Rick turns the entire school (including Toby Matthews) on Summer. Morty finally has enough, and he and Summer sneak up on Tiny Rick just as he is trying to destroy Rick's original body and they force him to listen to Elliot Smith music. Rick's emotional reaction to the music allows him to break free of his younger self's control, and he gets his grandkids to transfer his mind back to his older body. Once this is finished, he heads down to his underground lair and brutally destroys his other younger clones, with a newfound respect for his current age.  After Rick drops off (or rather abandons) Beth and Jerry at therapy, they are greeted by [[Glexo Slim Slom]]. Glexo puts Jerry into a helmet attached to a machine that creates [[Beth's Mytholog|Jerry's perception of Beth]], a monstrous creature. Beth is immediately offended by this, telling Jerry to take it back. Beth then puts on the helmet, creating a [[Jerry's Mytholog|weak, worm version of Jerry]]. Jerry is also upset by Beth's perception of him. Glexo then leads the couple and other visitors on a tour of the facility, where all the couples' perceptions are kept in cages. The idea behind the therapy is that the perceptions are not the real marriages and that they are all safe from the perceptions. However, in a major disaster, Beth's mytholog manipulates Jerry's mytholog into helping her escape, and she rampages through the facility, killing staff and visitors alike. Glexo angrily informs Jerry and Beth that this is a sign that their relationship has become co-dependent, and the truth is neither of them should ever have gotten married (to which Jerry and Beth declare this is just bad couple's therapy). When the evacuation results in Jerry and Beth being left behind in the facility, Beth gets kidnapped by her own mytholog and attached to one of the machines to make more of her pathetic Jerrys. Beth questions why not just have Jerry make more Beths, but her mytholog replies that in Jerry's mind there can only be one true Beth. Jerry, encountering his own mytholog, grows frustrated that this is Beth's perception of who he really is and heroically comes to rescue her, causing Beth to create heroic Jerry mythologs who help Jerry in his fight (only to start making narcissistic Jerrys when she gets annoyed with his self-indulgent monologue). Just when it looks like they are losing the battle with the Beth mytholog Jerry has the idea to attach the helmet to one of his strong selves, creating Goddess Beth who destroys the monster, ending the fight. As the Jerry mythologs bow down to their goddess, the real Beth and Jerry reconcile.  In the epilogue, a vampire reports to the [[Vampire Master]] that Coach Feratu was destroyed. The master is flabbergasted that he named his alias after a famous vampire movie and makes a new rule: no more \""clever name bullshit\"".","{{Stub}}  What s new at school?  Nothing.  Nothing! Oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died.  They found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck and all the blood drained out of her.  Good lord! Who does something like that?  Obviously a vampire. W-w-where s the pepper?  Wait, what?! Vampires are real?!  Yes, Summer, vampires are real. Who knew?  Oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now.  Yeah, Summer, it s a big universe.  Get used to it. R-right, Rick?  Well, what are we going to do?!  We re gonna live our lives until we die.  Possibly by vampire. More likely auto accident or heart disease, but possibly vampire.  Grandpa Rick, couldn t you, like, use your superknowledge to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school and help us hunt the vampire down?  Um -- wow.  Yeah, pretty specific pitch, Summer.  I probably could turn myself into a teenager and hang out in the zit-covered, hormone-addled, low-stakes assworld that is high school.  But here s my reverse-ask -- why in the [Bleep] would I ever do that, ever?  And how dare you even ask me that?  And why aren t you more ashamed of yourself?  Dad!  Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.  Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter?  Sor-ry! I wasn t paying attention.  To a conversation about vampires?!  Clearly, I didn t know it was about vampires, because I wasn t paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me!  Oh, here we go, right to the victim role.  Am I a victim, Beth, or am I married to a mean, unfair monster that always hurts me?!  Jesus Christ!  Will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already?  Well, we tried a couples  therapist.  That s earth therapy.  You might as well ask a horse to fix a merry-go-round.  I mean, he ll try his best, but mostly, he s just gonna get horrified.  I know about a place off-planet with a 100% success rate.  Well, we want to make it work, if we can.  It s just -- then it s settled.  No need to pack.  Oh!  Let s go, go, go, go!  [Door opens, closes]  Do you think mom and dad are, you know, gonna get a divorce?  I think it s okay to dream, Morty.  I m gonna go make some wooden stakes.   266a  I booked you for a two-day intensive at nuptia four, the galaxy s most successful couples  counseling institute.  They could save the marriage of a dog and a bar of dark chocolate.  They could save the marriage of a p0rn star and a p0rn star.  Well, I know I m ready to try whatever it takes.  Which clearly implies that I m not.  It s not a competition, Beth.  Oh is that how you re gonna try to win, by implying I m competitive?  If the shoe fits.  My shoe fits up your ass.  You wish!  Okay, have fun. See ya Thursday!  Oh!  Jerk.  Don t insult my father.  He s the reason our kids are only half-stupid.  Ha! You just called yourself -- oh.  Beth and Jerry Smith?  Yes.  I m glaxo slimslom.  Welcome to nuptia four.  Your marriage can rest easy now.  Jerry, go ahead and sit there and put this on.  This machine isolates the part of the subject s brain containing all perceptions of its romantic partner.  And we will now render Jerry s perception of Beth with artificial biological life.  [Growl]  Interesting.  What the hell is that?! Take that back!  You do not think that about me!  I didn t do anything!  They scanned it out of my brain.  Can I take it back?  There s nothing to regret. We re dealing with unconscious, unhealthy thoughts.  Beth.  Now, we scan for Beth s perceptions of Jerry.  Scan hard. He s dead to me.  Everything s dead to you.  What?  Nothing.  [Whimper]  Read it and weep, bitch.  [Crying] Does everybody see what I mean?  I think we all see what you both mean.  [Bell rings]  Any leads on the vampire?  No, Summer! I mean, you know, I think it might be time that we just l-let it go.  Oh, so, now, you re too cool for this, just because grandpa Rick is?  It s not that, it s just that the universe is a little too big to care about something so small.  Aah!  What up, my helsings?  Who wants to hunt a vampire? Ha ha ha!  Rick? How -- how did you --  Yeah, I got bored and then, I remembered, this morning, how I blew Summer off, and I thought, \""hey, why are you such a grumpy douche, Rick?  Go to the garage, transfer your mind into a younger clone of yourself, and get embroiled in some youthful hijinks, what s the bfd?\""  So here I am. I m tiny Rick!  O-o-okay.  Well, it s good you re here, Rick.  I was pretty sure we didn t have what it takes to deal with a bloodsucker on our own.  Don t short-sell yourself, Summer.  You got everything it takes. But it ll still be fun to do this as a [Bleep] team, mother[Bleep] tiny Rick!  Yeah! Oh, my God, Toby Matthews!  Hey, Toby. I m tiny Rick. I m new.  Hey oh -- go easy on me. Ha ha. Just kiddin .  I like your straightforward style and that lab coat s pretty cool.  Summer.  He knows my name!  Why wouldn t he? You re great!  But, listen, just be careful.  We can t rule anybody out as the vampire, not even the dreamboats.  Stop, tiny Rick.  Huntin  a vampire with my grandkids!  [Bleep]! Tiny ri-I-ck!  Glaxo: The next step is to watch your mythologues interact together and, uh -- big surprise -- it s never pretty.  [Laughter]  Here we have garrrh and zharbidar gloompfschs, or, should I say, here we have the way garrrh and zharbidar perceive each other.  [Roaring]  [Chuckling] As we can all see, this is hardly the real garrrh and zharbidar.  Which is good, because the relationship in their heads is not only ugly, it s unsustainable.  [Beep]  [Roar]  [Growling]  You may already be learning something important -- all of these relationships are different, none of them are real, and none of them work.  We are not the monsters we sometimes see each other as, because we are real and we are functional.  That s what makes us better than them.  We can find solutions.  We can adapt.  We can communicate.  [Growl]  And, most importantly, we can work together.  Well, it was a tough adventure, but it paid off -- our school is vampire-free!  Man, who would ve suspected coach feratu?  You did great, guys. Couldn t have done it without ya.  You know, we -- w-we should be proud of ourselves.  We killed a vampire and a gym teacher.  Ha ha ha. Talk about two-for-one, right?!  So, how, exactly, is your old body living in there, grandpa Rick?  Oh, you know, hyperbaric quantum fluid, [burp] That kind of thing.  It preserves living tissue. Not that there was much to preserve. Look at that mummy! Ha! Ha ha!  And I guess it s time for me to get back inside the old-timer.  Oh, my God. Toby Matthews is asking if my parents are still out of town and if we can have a party!  All right, way to go, Summer! What did I tell you?  Ohh! He s asking if tiny Rick will be here.  Well, you know what, Summer?  Tell him tiny Rick will be here!  And tell him to bring some brews!  For real? Y-y-y-you would stay as tiny Rick, just so we can have a party?  Hell, yeah! What s one more night?  And who can have fun with this old b*st*rd hanging around, huh?  [Laughter]  Wubby lubby doob doob!  Whoo!  Tiny Rick!  [Growl]  Moving on. Now, we have Beth and Jerry Smith from the planet e-arth.  My heart is pounding.  This is gonna be great.  The e-arth relationships are simpler.  It s a primitive planet, so their dysfunctions are oh -- w-wait, what? What s going on?  Where are the Smith mythologues?  [Suspenseful music plays]  Jerry: Oh, my God.  [Shriek]  [Gasp]  Aah! Aah!  Oh, my God. Secure the cell!  Aaaah!  [Slice]  Uh, hey! You know what s fun? Our gift shop.  Why don t we proceed in an orderly --  [growl]  [ Whimpering ]  Oh, dear God, no.  They re codependent!  Run!  [Roaring]  Oh!  [Crickets chirp]  [Chatting]  [Rock music plays]  [ Laughter ]  Oh, yeah, yeah, you really know how to sport that color blue.  Really?  You re looking real good. Oh, my God.  Hey, Morty.  Oh, hey -- hey, Jessica.  So, is tiny Rick your brother or cousin, or...?  No, my grandpa just transferred his consciousness into a clone of himself so he could be in our high school.  Cool.  Hey, tiny Rick s playing guitar.  All right, everybody.  This next one s coming straight from the heart.  Making the lyrics up right off the top of my head.   266a Let me out  266a  266a what you see is not the same person as me  266a  266a my life s a lie  266a  266a I m not who you re looking at  266a  266a let me out, set me free  266a  266a I m really old; This isn t me  266a  266a my real body s slowly dyin  in a vat  266a  266a is anybody listening   266a  266a can anyone understand?  266a  266a Stop lookin  at me like that and actually help me  266a  266a help me!  266a  266a Help me; I m gonna die!  266a  Tiny Rick! Thanks, everybody!  [Cheering]  This guy s amazing!  I love tiny Rick!  Bad. Ass.  [Hooting]  Yeah!  [Snarl]  [Hiss]  [Screaming in distance]  [Rattle]  Aah!  [Ominous music plays]  [Growl]  Huh?  What the [Bleep]?  Yeah, I know! What kind of operation are you running?  Us?! What the hell kind of relationship do you have?!  Oh, right, blame this on us.  Okay, uh, I can and I am!  Your demonized mythologizations of each other are cooperating.  Isn t that good?  No. No! It s bad!  You have the single worst marriage I ve ever witnessed.  It shouldn t exist!  You should never, ever, ever, have gotten together and I do not understand how, or why, you would ever stay together.  Aaah!  Well, this is just bad couples  therapy.  Totally.  [Panting]  [Suspenseful music plays]  Wait for us!  There s only room for one more.  I m a therapist. I ll talk to them.  They re not therapists.  Go, go, go!  There s gotta be a way to contact my dad.  Let s find a control room or something.  [Suspenseful music plays]  [Creak]  Beth! You ll want to see this.  What is it?  It s a small, hinged panel with a tiny amount of space behind it.  If you can find one, too, we should be safe for hours, maybe days!  You stay put, Jerry.  I ll send help, if I make it.  You don t want to find your own little hatch?  Jerry, I believe that, if you hide by yourself, you might survive and I believe I, by myself, have a shot of getting out of here, but the two of us, together?  I don t know.  Look, maybe the shrink was right.  Good luck.  [Roar]  All right, now, you listen to me.  Oh! Or don t.  Hey! Don t! Please!  [Hissing]  [Whining]  Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!  Now, I know I ve said, in the past, that math is important -- and it is! -- but I also think that, one day, you ll all look back on being in high school with tiny Rick and Morty, who I hear had a great party last night.  So, class dismissed.  You ve got the day off!  All right! Good work, Mr. Goldenfold!  Yeah, get outside. Read a book.  Put on some sunscreen, Danielle!  Hey, what s up, Summer? Ooh, nice top.  Thanks. Tiny Rick, you think you might be getting back into your old body tonight?  No can do. Tonight s the big dance and Morty s bringing Jessica. He needs his tiny wing man.  Both: Tiny Rick! [Laughs]  Okay, but if not tonight, when?  I don t know. When I feel like it?  Damn, girl! You need to chill out!  This whole thing was your idea, in the first place, and, now, you re trying to rush it along.  Yeah, and you know what? I like high school.  I like hanging out.  Tiny Rick!  But what if the you that likes it isn t you?  [Laughter]  Oh!  Both: Oh, Summer!  It s just Rick in a younger body.  What s the -- what s -- what s -- what s -- what s the -- what s the problem?  Look at his art, Morty.  I ve got an emo streak.  It s part of what makes me so rad.  Why does it say \""help me Morty and Summer!\""?  Come on, Summer, that s the title of the art.  Why was Knight Rider called Knight Rider?  The car s name was kitt. Nobody rode Michael Knight.  You re overthinking it, Summer.  I m tiny Rick!  Grandpa, I think that, when you put your mind into this body s young brain, it did what young brains do -- it shoved the bad thoughts into the back and put a wall around them.  But those bad thoughts are the real Rick.  The fact that you re old, the fact that we re all going to die, one day, the fact that the universe is so big, nothing in it matters, those facts are who you are.  So you re trapped in there and you can only come out in the form of tiny Rick s teen angst!  Well, Summer, I hear Toby Matthews isn t into psycho chicks.  Can t think of anyone that is.  I ll see you mother[Bleep] at the dance! Tiny Rick!  Morty, you have to help me!  Summer, he s happy! I m happy!  I-I-is that why you re doing this, you don t want me and Rick to be happy?  No.  Well, then get your sh1t together!  Get it all together and put it in a backpack.  All your sh1t, so it s together.  And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know?  Take it to the sh1t store and sell it o-or put it in a sh1t museum. I don t care what you do!  You just gotta get it together.  Get your sh1t together.  [Slug wailing]  [Gasping]  Get back!  [Fart]  Wait, for real?  [Whimpers]  You re how Beth sees me?  Oh, my God.  Turn around!  I said turn around!  How can Beth have these thoughts about me?!  That judgmental monster bitch!  I m not taking this.  I want to know where my wife is.  You are going to help me.  No! Nobody s doing that!  [Growling]  Stay.  What do you want?  Jerrys.  You want Jerry?  I don t even want Jerry.  I want Jerrys.  Waahee!  An army.  [Laughs]  An army of Jerrys.  The value of his subservience is wasted on you.  I will use it to dominate the universe.  Ah ha ha. Boy, Jerry must think I m pretty stupid, for you to be this stupid.  Wouldn t it make more sense to put my dumbass husband in this chair, so you can make an army of youbadass self?  [Laughs]  There could never be more than one of me.  I m the strongest, smartest being alive because Jerry thinks you re that much stronger and smarter than you are!  Okay, ouch.   266a  Oh, hey h-hey-y!  Morty, Jessica, what s up?  Check out the new dance I made up.  It s called \""ooh let me out!\""   266a Let me out  266a  266a let me out  266a  266a this is not a dance  266a  266a I m beggin  for help  266a  266a I m screamin  for help  266a  266a please come let me out  266a  266a let me out  266a  266a let me out  266a  266a this is not a dance  266a  266a I m beggin  for help  266a  266a I m screamin  for help  266a  266a please come let me out  266a  266a I m dyin  in a vat  266a  266a in the gara-a-ge  266a  [cheering]  Awesome!  Okay, that last part was really weird.  Maybe Summer s on to something here.  I don t know. It was fun.  You want to slow dance?  Tiny Rick, hey, great dancing as usual.  Moment of your time?  Tiny Rick, this conversation is gonna break my heart wide open.  You re a great student and the fact that you re an 80-year-old man in a clone body, it never bothered me.  But this here is another matter.  You recognize this?  We got a tip it was in your locker.  Yeah, now, because the gym coach was a vampire, the school board is embarrassed and won t take it public, however, they can t have students killin  teachers.  I gotta expel you for this one, tr.  I m sorry.  I just got expelled, Summer!  Oh! So I guess there s no need to stay young.  My top!  Screw your top!  You ratted on me?!  I m tiny Rick!  Fine! Yes! Because I love you and I m trying to save your life!  High school is my life!  Summer Smith is a [Bleep] psycho nerd and she just got me kicked out of school!  All: [Gasp]  [Thud]  Boo!  Summer, I thought you were cool!  I m sorry, okay?  How can you be such a bitch?  Oh, my God, Morty.  Your sister crossed tiny Rick?  Talk about self-destructive.  Yeah.  Jerry: Hey, Jerry-lover!  How about a taste of the real thing?  [Cocks gun]  [Roar]  Jerry!  Ah. Ah. Ah.  Ah ah ah ah ah aah aah.  Not on my watch.  That s it!  Beth, it s me, your husband!  I m here to save you.  Or my name isn t Jerry Smith!  Aha!  Yes!  Jerry Smith!  Yeah, here.  Aha!  Okay, fair enough.  [Ominous music plays]  [Door creaks open]  Say goodnight, old man.  [Gasp]  What the hell are you doing?!  Put it down!  Summer, you bitch!  Don t talk to her that way! She s your granddaughter!  I don t need a granddaughter! I m tiny ri-I-ck!  She s my sister! And if tiny Rick is gonna be an asshole to my sister, then, you know, y-y-you may as well be old again.  You think you re tough, huh, Morty?  What are you gonna do?  I m tiny Rick.  I m the coolest kid in your school.  How are you gonna just make me do whatever you say, huh?  I m gonna do what real Rick would do if he was here --  I m gonna kick your ass!  Ohhhh!  [Grunting]  Rick, I know you re in there!  I know you re trying to get out!  That s it, Morty! Hold him down!  [Ominous music plays]  [Ballad]   266a drink up, baby  266a  266a stay up all night  266a  Listen to it, tiny Rick.  Listen to Elliott Smith.  Ugh! No!  Feel what he s feeling.  Ugh! Noooooooo! God!   266a That you ll never see  266a  Oh, God, what is life?  How can someone so talented die so young?  What is being young?  I m not young. I m old.  I m -- I m gonna die.  My body isn t real.  Morty! Summer!  It s me! It s Rick!  Regular Rick!  Rick! How do we get you back into your body?  Okay, listen carefully. There s a set of diodes on the vat s control panel, a blue one and a red one.  Oh, God, what kind of world is this?  I didn t ask to be born. I need you to connect the blue one to my left temple and the red one to -- why doesn t anyone really like me?  Focus, grandpa! Just put the stupid wires on my head! I hate being a teenager!  Ugh! Arrgghh!  Ah! Uhhhhh!  Jerry, you can t bend metal.  Then make a me that can!  How can I do that while I m watching you totally fail to bend metal?  Good old Beth!  The mind of a robot and the heart of an insect!  Don t talk that way about her.  What?  Oh, it hurts!  Oh, God.  Stop.  This representation displeases me.  Aaah!  Good lord. How did you...?  Well, I had a feeling that, in your mind, the ideal version of me is one smart enough to see you as...  A goddess.  Not such a stupid worm now, are you?  Honey, when it comes to the subject of your ego, I m Stephen [Bleep] hawkinson.  Ugh, it s -- never mind.  I love you.  [Processing, powering up]  [Buzz]  Ugh agh.  Rick! Pants!  Holy sh1t!  Thanks, kids. You figured it out.  Well, Summer did.  Kind of weird that you were that willing to sell my existence out for some trim, Morty.  What?! Pants!  But listen -- I forgive you both because you know what?  I learned, today, something important -- the teenage mind is its own worst enemy.  Oh, I also learned this...  [Beeping]  Operation Phoenix is not the fallback I thought it would be.  I guess it s back to the drawing board.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God. Put some pants on!  Put pants on.  Grandpa s back, baby!  Grandpa s --  [Buzz]  Oh, man, I gotta pick up your parents.  They have been blowin  me up.  One last swing for the road!  Aaaaaaaaaaah!  For the love of God, get dressed!  So, what do you think? You wanna keep this marriage going a while longer?  At least until Morty has graduated high school.  Oh. Mm.  [Moaning lightly]  Aha, you see? What did I tell you two?  It worked.  You know what, Rick? I guess, in a way -- already lost interest. Get in the car.  I ve been inside a kid all day and, now, I can feel my bones scraping each other.  Uh, just so you re prepared, there s a bunch of dead mes in the garage.  Huh! Sounds like our stories were connected by a theme.  [Laughter]  Not really, Jerry.  Probably a cosmetic connection your mind mistakes for thematic.  Oh.  Old Rick! Ruinin  everything!   266a  [Squeaking]  [Ominous music plays]  Master.  Speak.  Coach feratu s presence was discovered by the humans.  He has been destroyed.  No bother.  The mortals shall soon --  I m sorry, what did you say his name was?  Coach feratu. Coach feratu.  That was his real name, like his actual vampire name?  No no no no. His vampire name was balik alistane.  Why the [Bleep] would he name himself after a famous vampire movie? Was he doing a bit?  I do not know, your unholiness.  Jesus [Bleep] Christ.  From now on, no more of this clever-name bullshit.  When a vampire is pretending to be a human, they can just call themselves Alan Jefferson or something like that.  It s crazy, right?  I mean, am I being an asshole?  Okay, I feel like everybody in the room is looking at me like I m the buzzkill.  I m not?  Good. Okay. Great.  [Hiss]  Oh, my g--!  Did you get any of that?  It s-a good-a show!  [Drumroll] "

While waiting for the results of Jerry's treatment, Rick, [[Beth Smith|Beth]], [[Summer Smith|Summer]], and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] sit in the hospital's waiting room. Unwilling to watch QCV (an alien version of QVC), Rick jury-rigs the cable box with his inter-dimensional crystal. After smashing the cable box and hooking up the crystal, a nurse asks him what he is doing to which Rick replies, \""A sequel.\"" After watching \""[[Man vs. Car]]\"" (a competition pitting men against cars in a gladiatorial ring) and a commercial for \""Eyeholes\"" (a cereal protected diligently by [[Eyeholes Man|a spandex-clad alien with a megaphone]]), a distraught Beth sits down with them in the waiting room.  Jerry wakes in his hospital room, cured of his bacterial infection. His doctor, accompanied by a number of others, explains that the galaxy's most influential civil rights leader, [[Shrimply Pibbles]], is in the same hospital dying; he can be saved, however, if Jerry donates his sexual organs to Pibbles to act as a heart. An elderly alien in a wheelchair arrives, and he expresses his doubt that Jerry will help him, as Earth culture is built around sex. Upset by the notion, Jerry agrees to donate his organs in an attempt to redeem Earth's reputation.  After a brief remark by Morty about an odd-looking woman getting coffee, Rick turns to \""[[How Did I Get Here?]]\"", and Morty discovers that the odd woman has disappeared from the waiting room, having suddenly reappeared on top of a streetlamp in the show. The entire family is perplexed by the occurrence, and Rick advises them to \""stay away from the coffee machine.\"" They then watch an ad for \""[[Jan Quadrant Vincent 16]]\"" (an action-adventure starring several copies of Jan Michael Vincent).  Jerry, in the meantime, is having second thoughts about donating to Pibbles, and he tells his doctor that he wants to consult with Beth before moving forward with the surgery. After the rest of the family watches \""[[The Adventures of Stealy]]\"" and \""[[Funny Songs]]\"", the doctor comes into the waiting room and addresses the family, telling them that Jerry is fine, but also asking the Beth come with him. After Jerry tells her about the surgery, the conversation among Beth, Jerry and the doctor spirals downward, but upon reading the catalog of highly advanced prosthetics Jerry can be given to replace his missing organs, Beth decides to let Jerry choose for himself. Still not willing to say no, Jerry concedes.  As the family watches \""[[Lil' Bits]]\"" (a commercial for a restaurant with minuscule food portions), Jerry is given the chance to \""use\"" his organs one last time, as the doctor leaves him in his office with alien pornography and a towel. Not aroused by the videos, Jerry discovers that the doctor has left Pibbles' medical records open behind the windows of porn; the doctor then re-enters the room and tells Jerry as much, asking him to use discretion. Jerry does not, but instead examines the medical records and finds a piece of information that he believes will allow him to keep his sexual organs.  Watching \""Opposite News with Michael Thompson\"" and \""Cooking Things with Pichael Thompson\"", the family soon discovers that the two hosts are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins conjoined twins], shooting their shows simultaneously side-by-side. Rick remarks to Summer that she \""has no idea how much that must save production.\"" The hospital meanwhile holds a news conference to announce that Pibbles can be saved, and also to introduce Jerry, the donor responsible for the opportunity. When Jerry, speaking to the very large crowd, mentions Pibbles' \""ongoing battle with heroin dependency\"", the crowd applauds enthusiastically. A confused Jerry inquires as to whether or not the heroin issue was a matter of public record, to which a few upset reporters reply that heroin comprised ten percent of the atmosphere of Pibbles' home planet\u2014at least, before it was destroyed by Klargon death squads, which rendered him unable to breathe without heroin. The entire audience boos Jerry, realizing that he is trying to keep from losing his member.  Rick, Summer, and Morty watch an episode of \""[[How They Do It]]\"" (which details the manufacturing process behind the plumbus) and [http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Personal_Space \""The Personal Space Show\""] (hosted by a man obsessed with keeping his personal space unoccupied, even by his own skin)\u2014which is followed by an advert for \""The Northsiders\""\u2014before finding an alien athletic competition. At the press conference, one of the doctors quiets the furious crowd, announcing that large numbers of people, having heard of Jerry's double-cross and wanting to save Pibbles, have donated enough money to purchase a synthetic heart for him. Jerry, upset and offended, begins to think of a way to regain his honor. Later, as the surgery begins, Jerry bursts into the operating room wielding a pistol-like apparatus, demanding that they cut off his member and use it to save Pibbles.  Rick, Summer, and Morty, in the meantime, watch [http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Octopus_Man \""Octopus Man\""], a clip that ends with the main character needlessly stabbing two random people to death on the street. Summer voices opposition to unnecessary violence in television, and Morty responds by yelling that her views on television are primitive. Beth arrives, telling them that they can leave, but a news report suddenly breaks through, announcing that Jerry is holding the doctors hostage. Discovering that the holdup is not happening in another dimension, Beth and Summer rush to the scene, where Jerry is in a standoff with two armed guards; demanding to know what is going on, Jerry only replies, \""I'm a good person.\"" Beth then realizes that the thing Jerry is holding is not a gun, but one of the highly advanced vibrators from the catalog. Out of options, Jerry pulls down his pants and runs at Pibbles' body, tearfully reasserting that he is \""a good person\"". The guards open fire on Jerry, shooting him fifty-seven times as the entire family screams in horror (Rick and Morty watch the events unfold on the television); they continue to shoot him even after his mangled, lifeless body falls to the floor.  Some time later, Jerry awakens to an advertisement for [http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Butthole_Ice_Cream \""Butthole Ice Cream Parlor\""]. Realizing he is awake, Beth tells him that everything he remembers really happened, and that since they were at an alien hospital, repairing his body was, in Beth's words, \""like getting a splinter removed.\"" Jerry says that all he wanted was for people to like him, not hate him, and Beth responds that \""You can't make people like you. You just have to wait for hating you to bore them.\"" Rising from his bed, Jerry declares his intent to go to the zoo with his family, but they angrily shoot him down.  In a post-credits scene, Jerry sneaks into Rick's cupboard and tries to steal his Eyeholes cereal to eat from it only to be immediately assaulted by the furious Eyehole Man. Summer and Morty work to get the Eyeholes Man off of Jerry as Rick puts the box back in his cupboard while reprimanding Jerry for going through his part of the cupboard. Morty quotes \""Why do you even have those?\""","   Rick   : Don t worry about Jerry. He s gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You re gonna be fine!  (Jerry pukes.)     Morty   : Woahh!     Rick   : ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It ll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it ll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.     Beth   : Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?     Rick   : I know this isn t the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.     Beth   : Not anymore.     Rick   : You re overreacting!     Alien       Nurse   : We re losing him.     Rick   : Alright fine, but you re not touching my CRISPR.     Summer   : Is he going to die?     Alien       Nurse   : Don t worry. Dr. Glipglop is the best in the galaxy     Dr   .    Glipglop   : Hello, I m Dr. Glipglop.  (Jerry pukes a projectile of bile directly at Dr. Glipglop. Dr. Glipglop breaks out into a murderous rage. Rick then disintegrates Dr. Glipglop )     Rick   : What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the gal(Belch)axy. It s like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?     Beth   : Go in the waiting room, Dad.     Rick   : Fine! (Transition to the waiting room) Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don t care. Well this won t do.(Rick walks up to a TV and smashes the cable box)     Alien Nurse   : Hey! What are you doing!?!     Rick   : A sequel.     Alien Nurse   : I don t understand.     Rick   : Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time. (On the TV: Inter-dimensional Cable II)  (Intro)  (Rick begins to flip through channels while Morty and Summer look very worried)     Randy Dicknose   : Man vs. Car. The newest hit show where it pits a man vs. a car. Tonight s episode Jenkins fights... a regular old car. Here we go. He s pushin  his way through, he s trying to fight that car. The car seems to have the upper hand- Oh, he just got some push-back there.  (The car runs over the man and the tires rip him apart)     Randy Dicknose   : Oh, he just got ran over and chewed up by the tires. I guess that s another one for the car. Ha ha ha ha ha... I mean, wouldn t the cars always win...?  (Channel changes)     Alien Man   : Samantha, I need to know that you understand that I have a couple of eye-holes. (The Alien tears off some skin flaps and reveals some eye-holes)     Samantha   : I do, I do understand about your eye-holes! Here, look at my eye-holes! (She tears off her skin flap to reveal many more eye-holes)     Alien Man   : Oh, my goodness you have eight eye-holes! (Their eye-holes make contact and start to \""kiss\"") Oh, I m looking through your eye-holes!     Samantha   : Yes, look through my eye-holes!  (The Eye-hole man hovers above the home in a helicopter, then uses a rope to drop into the house)     Eye-hole Man   : I m the Eye-hole Man! I m the only one whose allowed... to have eye-holes! (He kicks the eye-holes out of the aliens  heads) Get on up outta here with my eye-holes!     Announcer   : Eye-holes! Get them today! IKEA.     Rick   : You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it s worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They re delicious.     Beth   : I can t believe you re explaining alien cereal, we re worried about Jerry.     Rick   : Well you re thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Jesus, Christ, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?  (Transition to Jerry who is just waking up in his hospital bed)     Jerry   : Where am I?     Alien Doctor   : Relax Mr. Smith, you re in an alien hospital. I mean to you it s an alien hospital, to me you re just in a hospital. There s another matter we need to discuss with you.     Jerry    Ok?     Alien 1   : An hour ago Shrimply Pibbles, the galaxy s most influential civil rights leader, was brought to this hospital s emergency room where he is currently fighting for his life!     Jerry   : My God!     Alien 1   : Mr. Smith, Shrimply Pibble s life can be saved if we replace his heart with your human penis.     Jerry   : I see-WAIT! What?     Alien Doctor   : It s perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call \""your balls\"". With relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a functioning heart for the most important man in the universe!     Jerry   : Yeah, but, I mean-     Alien 2   : Oh, forget it! I told you this was a waste of time!     Alien 1   : Have respect Yarp, the earth man s world is tiny and undeveloped. He knows nothing of the genocides of Klorgon or the tragic events of 6-5.3-4-3-2.2-3-14     Old Alien   : And even if he did, he wouldn t comprehend them. I ve dwelt among the humans. Their entire culture is built around their penises. It s funny to say they are small, it s funny to say they are big. I ve been at parties, where humans have held bottles, pencils, thermoses in front of themselves and called out \""hey look at me! I m Mr. so and so dick.\"" \""I ve got such and such for a penis.\"" I never saw it fail to get a laugh.     Jerry   : Alright! That s enough. You guys are talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!     Alien 1   : Then you would give your penis so that Shrimply Pibbles may live?     Alien 2   : Stop asking!     Jerry   : Yes I will! That s right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling, Jerry Smith from Earth didn t flinch!  (Back to the waiting room where Rick is laughing while everyone else is stressed)     Rick   : Hey, what s wrong Morty? Oh, you re worried about your dad, huh?     Morty   : Huh? Uh, no no no, I m-I m just looking at that lady getting coffee. What s up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, how he has the shit all over his face but he s just a human in a costume, you know?     Rick   : Morty let s-let s see what else is on.     Morty   : Okay.     TV Host   : And now we re back to \""How Did I Get Here?\"" The only show that makes you ask \""How Did I Get Here?\"" (Weird laughing from him) Here s our first person!  (It s the Worf lady stuck on top of a light post)     Worf Lady   : Oh, oh my goodness! How did I get here? HELLO!?! How did I get here!?! Somebody help me, please!  (Morty looks back where the Worf Lady was and sees that she is not there)     TV Host   : Ha ha ha ha, right!     Morty   : Whoa! Look! It s that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! Tha-That was getting coffee! How did she get there!     Rick   : Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?     TV Host   : How DID she get there? He he (winks at the camera)     Beth   : Is that something we should be concerned about?     Rick   : Just stay away from the coffee machine.     TV   : Calling all Jan-Michael Vincent s, calling all Jan-Michael Vincent s!     Announcer   : In a world, where there s eight Jan-Michael Vincents.     Intercom (TV)   : We need one Jan-Michael Vincent to quadrant C. Two Jan-Michael Vincents to quadrant E.     Announcer   : And sixteen quadrants. There s only enough time for a Jan-Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can t be in two quadrants at once.     Morty   : Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?     Rick   : Oh man, I m trying to remember Morty.     Announcer   : Jan-Michael Vincents are used up.     (On TV)       Radio Control Guy   : I need a goddamn Jan-Michael Vincent!     Morty   : Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?     Rick   : Nope.     Alien-Robo Judge   : I refuse to sign the legislation that allows more than eight Jan-Michael Vincents to a precinct.     Announcer   : This JANuary, It s time to MIKE down your Vincent s. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16.     Rick and Morty   : Whoa!     Rick   : That s Jan-Michaels.     Morty   : Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.     Rick   : All right, Morty you ve done it!  (Back to Jerry in the operating room from the view of a woman giving birth)     Alien Doctor   : So, we ll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here. (The Alien Doctor draws on Jerry with a red marker)     Jerry   : Got it.     Alien Doctor   : Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-     Jerry   : (Laughs nervously) Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I m having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven t run this whole decision past my wife.     Alien Doctor   : Oh, do you think she ll be okay with this?     Jerry   : Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make.  (Back to the TV)     Stealy   : Hey, I m Stealy. Follow me on my adventure through this office. Alright, here we go. We re gonna just steal a couple of things. (He walks into another room and just starts taking things)     Business Man   : Excuse me. Can I help you?     Stealy   : Starting with common office objects.     Business Man   : Hey, hey, hey! That s my stuff!     Stealy   : Such as staplers and pins and all sorts of things like-such as that.     Business Man   : That s it. I m calling security.  (Stealy chloroforms the man, then takes his body with him, transition to Stealy walking through the streets, transition to Stealy in his safe room full of items)     Stealy   : All right, okay, we re in the quiet safe room where none of the people whose stuff I stole can get to us. Now, let s look at all the stuff we got. We got a bag of Bobbish. That s eight brapples. We got a plumbus. That s six and a half brapples. We got, uh, a-crushed party cups. Fifteen and a half brapples.  (The show plays a \""winner\"" dinging sound effect) (The TV transitions to a stand up comedy show.)     Comedian   : Welcome back to \""funny songs\"". It s all improvised. It s very funny. I need a volunteer from the audience.     A man in the audience   : Um, longtime fan of the show. Uh-     Comedian   : What do you do? What is your profession?     A man in the audience   : I am a tax attorney.     Comedian   : Okay, here we go. Hit-hit the music. (Bad singing): I m a tax attorney oh, geez, oh forget about everybody else, forget about Jesus Christ, forget about Muhammed, forget about.... all those religions! Ba da ba ba da ba bop! The end.     A man in the audience   : Oh man. Oh, that was so-so funny. Thank you.     Comedian   : You re welcome. Hey, um, security guards, take him out. Get him out of here.     A man in the audience   : What?     Comedian   : Get the orthodontist out of here.     A man in the audience   : No! Why?!?  (The security guards start beating him up)     Comedian   : Take him out of the audience. Kill him. Sick him. (A dog runs in and attacks) Demons, suck his life out. I don t give a shit.     Alien Doctor   : Smith family?     Beth   : Yes?     Alien Doctor   :I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.     All   : Yeah, whoo, awesome, called it, that s good news!     Alien Doctor   : But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?  (Transition to Jerry s hospital room)     Jerry   : Hi, honey, so, here s the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien s heart, and we just need you to sign off on it.     Beth   : WHAT!?!     Jerry   : Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes.     Alien Doctor   : His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there s a wide range of options to chose from, they re all in this catalog.     Beth   : I don t care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you re doing?     Alien Doctor   : I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith.     Beth   : Oh, I don t think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, he s gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. It s--It s--It s--It s, I mean.  (She looks at the catalog and gets less and less angry about the idea)     Jerry   : Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it s hard to understand, but on Earth, love comes first.     Alien Doctor   : There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. His fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms.     Beth   : Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?     Alien Doctor   : Hundreds of billions.     Beth   : I mean, Jerry, y-you didn t explain the full gravity of the situation.     Jerry   : Uh, well, Beth, I don t think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife s decision to keep her LOVER INTACT.     Beth   : Well I don t think that s fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones.     Jerry   : Beth, can we talk about this privately?     Beth   : You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, \""I prefer to keep my penis.\""     Jerry   : (louder): But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?!     Beth   : Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?  (She looks at the catalog again, definitely with future plans in mind.)  (Transition to the waiting room, a commercial plays)     Restaurant chef   : Hey, listen, is your mouth tiny and small? Then why don t you come down to  Little Bits?      Background whisper   : LIttle Bits!     Resturant chef    (improvised): Where the food is tiny...it looks like regular food. But really tiny. You put it in your mouth and eat it. Nothing gets stuck in your lips. It s just tiny and tiny and fits (laughter) fits right in!     Background whisper:    Little Bits!     Restaurant chef: (improvised)    We got....tiny uh-lasagna. tiny pizza, tiny pie. Mmh! Little tiny...fried eggs! (surprised) Oh, shit! We got tiny people!     Background whisper   : Little Bits!     Restaurant chef (improvised)   :You hungry? Come on down!      Background whisper   : Little Bits!     Restaurant chef   : Eat some fucking shit, you fucking stupid bitch! (laughter) Just kidding.  (Transition to Jerry and the alien doctor. Alien doctor leads Jerrry into a secluded room with a desk and a computer)     Alien doctor:    You got some time to kill befpre the procedure, so I assume you d like to uh....use your penis one last time. Here s my computer. It s got the alien internet on it. (He clicks and a window opens where tentacles tickle an alien hole of some sorts) There s some...porn. And there s an alien towel- I actually got that on another planet, so it is an alien towel to me! Good luck!     Jerry    (disspirited): Thanks. (he watches the doctor leave with a hopeless expression, looks at the towel and sighs. He sits down, clicks the alien porn away and finds secluded information about Shrimply Pibbles.) What is this? (he takes a closer look) Hmm..Hey! Wait a minute!     Alien doctor    (from outside): Oh, um...Mr. Smith!     Jerry    (lying hastily while pulling down his pants): Yeah, just masturbating!     Alien doctor    (enters): I forgot to mention, there are extensive medical records open on my desktop, but >I trust you to confine your activities to the purely pornographic.     Jerry    (overly serious): Absolutely!     Alien doctor    (whlile leaving) Good luck!  (The door closes and Jerry clicks back on the window with the secluded information)     Jerry    (raises his eyebrow and can t believe his luck): My God! (laughs) Mr. Pibbles. (leans back and folds his arms behind his head) You just wrote my penis a one-way ticket to staying on my body town.  (Transition to the waiting room, a news show starts playing, a weird worm-like creature in a suit whose body fades out in the right screen holds a bunch of paper.)     Announcer:    It s the Opposite news, with Michael Thompson!     Michael Thompson:    Hey, everybody, it s me, Michael Thompson! Today, the pope...didn t..get killed! (His body gets a tug to the right and he looks irritated.) He s perfectly fine...and he s on vacation on Aruba.Uh. In other opposite news information-     Morty (confused and a little concerned):    Hey, Rick ..what s the deal with this guy? Why is his body, like..sloping off to the right side of the screen like that?     Rick (indifferent):    I dunno. Let s see what else is on, huh?  (Channel changes to a cooking show with a similar alien whose body disappears in the left side of the screen)     Pichael Thompson:    Hey, welcome to  cooking things ! I m Pichael Thompson!     Morty:    Hey, look, rick! This guy s body is, like, sloping down and leaning off to screen left!     Rick:    Oh my God, and his name s Pichael!     Pichael Thomson:    I m cooking a little bit of this, I m gonna cook a little bit of that.. (He gets irritated as he tugged and pulls Michael Thompson over to his side, their bodies are connected) Oh, hey! Stop tugging, Michael!     Morty (gets it):    Oh my God, Siamese twins! They re siamese twins!     Michael Thompson   : You quit tugging! I m in the middle of my news!     Pichael Thompson:    Oh, oh, it s always about you, isn t it. Can you believe this guy, ladies and gentlemen? He S got his own news show, he  got a normal name..     Morty:    Hey, flip back to the news!     Rick:    Oh, yeah, yeah,yeah!  (Rick flips the channel back to the news, the news show is without hosts, you hear the brothers arguing)     Pichael Thomson:    You can tell our parents started with naming him.It s like, oh, Michael. They had that one planned before they even got pregnant, I bet.     Summer:    I don t wanna be that girl, but maybe there would be less conflict if they didn t shoot there shows at the same time?     Rick:    Uh, Summer, you have no idea how much money that must save productions.  (The channels switch to the brothers again)     Pichael Thompson:    And then they found out I was attached to him along for the ride and they said,  Ah well, shit. Ah, just fuck it, call him Pichael!     Michael Thompson:    Fuck you, Pichael! You re a fucking piece of shit!  (Jingle. Summer looks scared, Morty looks creeped out, Rick looks indifferent.)  (Transition to an alien press conference, Alien 1 from the surgical room earlier is speaking, cameras click, Beth is searching the catalog, impressed, Jerry watches her angrily, Alien 2 watches Alien 1)     Alien  1:    Good afternoon!I know all of you are wondering about the condition of our dear beloved Pibbles.      Beth    (quietly to Jerry): Which would you prefer between the XP20 and the XP20XS?     Jerry    (angrily): I prefer my own penis! And so should you! (they stare at each other madly before getting interrupted by Alien 1):     Alien 1:    The brave earth man whose sacrifice is going to allow Shrimply Pibbles to live.Mr. Jerry Smith (cheering, Jerry walks over to the microphone)     Jerry:    Hello, everyone! Let s hear it again for Shrimply Pibbles, huh. (more cheering, cut to the audience) He s a good guy, isn t he? (cut back to Jerry, he looks like he s got a plan) I ve just been learning about his accomplishments, from his march on Flirk Blirk Square, to his ongoing battle with heroin dependancy, he s the best. (looks arrogant, but is startled as more cheering comes his way) Um...yeah..well...it occurs to me that his heroin addiction may not have been a matter of public record!     Male       reporter alien 1   : You realize heroin makes up to ten percent of the atmosphere on Shrimply Pibbles  home planet?     Female reporter alien:    His planet got destroyed by Clorgon death squads, he can t live outside of it without breathing heroin.     Jerry    (insecure): Right! I know that! I just think...(breathes deeply to search for an answer)     Male reporter alien 2   : This guy s trying to get out of giving away his penis!

Look Who's Purging Now,2,9,Look_Who%27s_Purging_Now,https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&titles=Look_Who%27s_Purging_Now&format=json,2_9_Look Who's Purging Now.txt,"['Rick Sanchez', 'Morty Smith', 'Jerry Smith', 'Summer Smith', 'Arthricia', 'General Store Owner', 'Lighthouse Keeper', 'Purge Planet Ruler', 'Taddy Mason', 'Beth Smith']","While flying through space, Rick and Morty collide with an interstellar insect which smears on the windshield; when Rick attempts to clean it, the windshield becomes even more smeared, and Rick decides to search for washer fluid on a nearby planet. Upon arriving, Rick discovers that the citizens of the planet sustain their peaceful way of life by engaging in open warfare on one night every year; upon discovering that the aforementioned night (which the citizens call \""The Festival\"") is that very evening, Rick pleasantly proposes to Morty that they stay and observe the murderous rite.  They succeed in finding wiper fluid, and they depart as the sun sets, flying low over the surface of the planet as the Festival begins. Rick's enthusiasm for the Festival is quickly crushed by a particularly gruesome death, which sprays copious amounts of blood onto his windshield. As he vomits out his window, thoroughly disgusted by the sight, Morty sees a girl in trouble and demands of Rick that they save her; when Rick objects, Morty blackmails him into complying. Upon landing (on top of one of the girl's attackers), Rick enthusiastically begins shooting everybody who comes near them. Morty suggests that the girl, [[Arthricia]], wait out the Festival in their ship, and Rick sarcastically agrees.  At the [[Smith Residence|Smith house]], [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] and [[Summer Smith|Summer]] get into an argument over Jerry's pointless conversation, and Jerry leaves the room while being heckled by Summer.  Arthricia asks Morty to stop asking her questions about The Festival, leading to an awkward silence. The girl suddenly screams that she has forgotten about her grandmother; the group travels to a ramshackle farmhouse, where, despite his misgivings, Rick follows Arthricia inside. She then double-crosses them: she overpowers Rick, steals his gun and shoots him with it, finally coercing Morty to surrender the ship. Apologizing to him, she flies away into the night, struggling with the controls. Moving inside the cabin, now on fire, Morty finds Rick wounded on the floor, and helps him out of the shack. A group of people advance on them; when Rick disintegrates one of them, however, they surrender and give him their weapons.  Summer and Jerry begin to renew their argument, but before they can do so, the \""space phone\"" Rick gave them rings, and Summer retrieves it from its somewhat forgotten place between the sofa cushions. Hiding out in a shack with Morty and in the process of creating a chemical solution to heal his wound, Rick gives them the details of their situation and, between dispatching people bursting into the cabin and Jerry asking if the person on the phone is [[Taddy Mason]], he dictates a number to Summer. After killing the last intruder with a spoon (the only thing Morty threw to Rick when he asked for help) and berating Morty for throwing him \""the one thing that can never kill anything\"", Rick tells Summer to find a red box over his workbench, take it outside, and enter the aforementioned number into the box.  To set up a beacon for what Rick identifies only as a \""package\"", Rick and Morty head toward a lighthouse, intending to assemble the beacon on the observation platform. However, the owner of the lighthouse consents only on the condition that one of them listens to a story of his. While Rick heads to the top of the lighthouse, Morty agrees to listen to the story, which he discovers is not only a movie script but is absolutely atrocious. To pass the time, he decides to eat one of the two candy bars given to them by the person who gave them the wiper fluid.  Summer and Jerry go to the garage, where Summer retrieves the red box and places it on the floor, berating Jerry for his insistence on resolving his issue as she inputs the numbers into the box. Upon the completion of the sequence, the box pops open, forming a launchpad for a large, silvery orb with a smaller red dot on its side. As Jerry continues trying to restore his dignity, the orb hurls itself through the ceiling into the sky, leading Summer to muse, \""Oh...he might have said to take it outside.\""  On the observation deck, Rick finishes assembling the receiver, while down in the main room, the owner finishes reading to Morty, whose patience is wearing thin. After repeatedly asking Morty for his honest opinion, Morty says he has a problem with the way the story begins with a flash back teaser, and the owner, suddenly offended, responds by ordering them to leave. Morty becomes confused and the owner claims that he shared something personal with him and he, \""took a giant shit on it\"". Morty becomes offended by the attacks against his character and tells the owner that they just asked to set up a beacon. The owner tells Morty that they no longer can do so because Morty is a, \""shitty person and insecure\"" and mounts the stairs. Upon reaching the top, he tells Rick to leave claiming that Morty is a, \""shitty person\"". Morty quickly defends himself by claiming that he, \""sat through\"" the entire screen play, further infuriating the owner. Fed up with the owners insecurities, Morty reveals that he hated the entire story. Rick reminds Morty that they're guests, Morty retorts that he tried to behave himself but the owner dragged his anger out. When the owner tries to shut the receiver down himself, Morty stops him, claiming that he's not a bad person just because the owner is insecure about his writing and pushes him down the flight of stairs in a fit of rage, killing him and leaving Rick astonished.  Jerry again tries to reconnect with Summer by recalling memories of the past, but the conversation devolves into a plea for money by Jerry. Summer leaves him in the garage by himself, and a piece of the shattered roof falls on his head, just after he utters \""...Guess this is what rock bottom feels like\""..  Leaving the lighthouse, a horde of rioters confronts them, including the man who gave them the wiper fluid and candy bars. Before a fight can break out, however, the orb-like probe lands between Rick and Morty and assembles suits of weaponized flying armor onto their bodies. Rick immediately begins to slaughter the mob. At first, Morty is hesitant, but he soon finds his, \""inner rage\"" and slaughters the entire mob (as his suit plays \""Feels Good\"" by Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!). Rick congratulates Morty on finding the ability to purge and they looking for their ship. Rick succeeds in finding it, crashed into the side of a building, but turns around to find Morty once again slaughtering every person in sight, even those who are hiding; even once every one has been killed, Morty continues firing round after round into long-dead bodies even as Rick gently ushers him back toward the ship.  Reaching the ship, they find Arthricia crawling on the ground nearby. As they train their weapons on her, she explains her true intentions: to use the ship to murder the arrogant rich people who force the peasants to fight to the death. Morty, drunk with rage, insists on killing Arthricia on the spot, but Rick tells Morty to calm down. Morty then threatens to kill Rick, at which point Rick tasers Morty to get him under control and asks Arthricia where the rich people are.  At a mansion outside of town, the planet's wealthy make a dinner toast to another successful year of The Festival, which has been going on for thousands of years. Moments later, the sound of \""[[Feels Good]]\"" floats through the air, and Arthricia, now wearing Morty's power suit, and Rick, with Morty tied to his back, break down the door. Rick tells the rich people that he has nothing against them, but that Arthricia is deeply offended by their forcing the peasants to kill each other while suffering no consequence themselves. He further explains that Arthricia's suit of power armor is a way of fairly apportioning power among them. Arthricia then begins to exact her revenge, slaughtering the rich people and inviting Rick to join in the bloodbath. Rick initially refuses, saying the killing has become \""gratuitous\"", but eventually joins in after being asked a second time. After killing all the rich people, Rick and Arthricia ecstatically dance to \""Feels Good\"".  As the sun rises in the morning, Morty finally wakes at the ship. After being encouraged by Rick, Morty goes over to talk to Arthricia, who spurns him by saying that she has a boyfriend.  As Rick and Morty are preparing to leave, the townsfolk discuss building a new society from the ground up, and Rick suggests using food to barter. After Rick and Morty leave, the discussion about food escalates into a bloody brawl. One of the townsfolk stops the brawl and explains a plan for stopping the violence, which stabilizes the basic concept of The Festival within the society.  On their way back to Earth, Morty reflects on his rage-fueled rampage with shame. Rick assures him that none of his actions were his fault and that the cause of his violent rage was due to eating the candy bar, which contained [[Purgenol]], a chemical that amplifies a person's violent tendencies. Rick convinces Morty that, despite what happened the previous night, nothing about who he was has changed. As Rick throws his candy bar in the back seat, the candy bar's wrapper faces up, revealing a sticker that reads \""Now Purgenol-Free\"".  In the post-credits scene, [[Beth Smith|Beth]] asks Jerry why their phone bill is $700 and inquires as to what \""Taddy Mason, L.L.C.\"" stands for. Soon, a Taddy Mason commercial plays on the television, which explains that it is a dial-a-friend pay service with a callback option. Beth soaks in this information while Jerry tries in desperation to shut off their television. After he finally unplugs the T.V., Beth bluntly tells Jerry to \""get a job\"".","*Morty: I got to tell you, Rick. It 2019s pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style. *Rick: I agree, Morty. [ Belches ] *It 2019s nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year. *Ohh! *Relax. *That 2019s what windshields are for. *I didn 2019t know that there were bugs out in space. *Well, w-what did you think, Morty? *Life just developed on earth by itself? *Here, let me take care of this. *Morty: Geez, Rick, that 2019s disgusting. *I don 2019t want to look at that. *Yeah, guess I 2019m out of fluid. *L-let me find a place to stop. *Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us? *The general store ought to have what you need. Thanks. *Of course, you 2019ll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown. *Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why? *Sundown is when the festival begins. *The festival? *Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace. *Oh, I know what this is! *You 2019ve been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence. *That 2019s right. *What?! *It 2019s like \""the purge,\"" Morty. That movie \""the purge\""? *Oh, have you been here before? *No, no, but I 2019ve been to a few planets with the same gimmick. *You know, sometimes it 2019s called the cleansing or the red time. *There was this one world that called it just murder night. *I-it 2019s a purge planet. *They 2019re peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge. *T-that 2019s horrible! *Yeah. *You want to check it out? * 266a *[ Electricity crackling ] *So, what do you do during the festival? *You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff? *Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff. *Oh, I bet you do, old timer.

Much better. Now we can see. *Great. *Hey, you know what, Morty? *Why don 2019t we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it? *What?! No! What is your problem?! *Morty, grow up. If you don 2019t want to watch, don 2019t watch, but, you know, it 2019s my car. *[ Belches ] Also, if you tell your mom about this, I 2019ll purge you. *You 2019re the worst. *And this planet is the worst.

Shh. Shh. It 2019s starting. *Oh-ho-ho! Here we go. *I 2019m not watching. *Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal 2019s in the mail. *I 2019m gonna get a closer look. *Oh, okay, sure. *And then someone 2019s gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we 2019re gonna crash and we 2019re gonna be stuck down there and it 2019s gonna be what we deserve. *Yawn. *Whoa!

W-we have to go down there. *Rick: [ Belching ] What? Why? *Morty: That poor girl. W-we have to save her. *Rick: Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call the non-interference policy. We got the wiper fluid. *We watched them kill each other. We 2019re leaving. *Morty: Help me save that girl, or I 2019m telling mom you brought me here. *You little turd. [ Screaming ] *Please! Leave me alone! *Leave you alone? During a purge? *I don 2019t think so, baby. *It 2019s okay. We 2019re not gonna hurt you. *Morty: My name is Morty. This is my grandpa. *We 2019re tourists. *Not anymore. *Aah! *Aah! *Oh, my God.

A \""Courier Flap\"" arrives, an organism servicing as an intergalactic mail service, with Birdperson's invitation to his wedding to Tammy on [[Planet Squanch]]. Rick immediately declines, saying that weddings always make people miserable (or, in his words, \""funerals with cake\""). While Beth attempts to convince Rick to attend his friend's special event, Jerry manages to be accidentally transported via the courier to the planet, forcing a reluctant Rick to bring the rest of the family to the wedding.  The family arrives with [[Squanchy]] greeting them, and the Smith Family (minus Rick) mingle with the numerous guests; Jerry unsuccessfully tries to joke with Tammy's parents, Beth inquires about Rick with Birdperson, who discloses vague and dark parts of his and Rick's past, and Morty protests to Rick about opening up more and enjoying the wedding.  [[File:TammyAgent.png|thumb|Tammy reveals herself as a Galactic Federation agent.]] Birdperson and Tammy are wed, and Rick reluctantly follows Morty's advice to open up by giving an ad-libbed wedding toast about love and his happiness the newly married couple. Unfortunately, the happiness ends when the bride reveals herself to be a deep undercover [[Galactic Federation]] agent, and that the building is surrounded by officers. When the reception erupts into chaos, Birdperson is shot multiple times and seemingly killed, much to Rick's horror. As the majority of the criminals attending the wedding are gunned down, Rick is about to use his portal gun when Tammy ambushes him and holds him at gunpoint, ordering him to give up the gun. He does so, although he also wires it to kill several Galactic Federation officers and explode before it is able to be recovered. Consequently, the explosion also renders Tammy temporarily deaf. As the final few shots are fired from those still living, Squanchy provides a diversion for the family to escape by drinking a potion and turning into a large warrior, temporarily fighting off the surviving Galactic Federation goons and avenging many of his allies' deaths.  Following the chaos at the wedding, an angered Rick reveals that he is vehemently against the Federation, enough to join forces with the late Birdperson and other like-minded rebels. Despite Beth's suggestion to return home, Rick points out that option is no longer possible, as Earth will be the first place for the Federation to look for him. He even goes as far as to say that if any of them were to go home themselves, they could be interrogated despite not knowing where Rick might escape to.  Instead, he suggests finding a new world to live in. Upon asking his computer, he finds out that there are 765 planets similar to Earth in the Milky Way with only 3 existing outside federal jurisdiction. They find a very similar Earth-like planet but also find that it is incredibly small. They then find a much larger planet where everything from the plants to even the animal life is \""on a cob\"". However, Rick panics from this discovery and quickly takes everyone back out. The last Federation-free planet seems almost perfect (and \""cob-free\""), until they discover a sun that screams endlessly throughout the planet's 42-hour day. With only this and the small Earth as their only options, they decide to return to the small Earth.  While hiding on the small Earth, the Smiths learn from a news broadcast that the Federation have occupied Earth in an attempt to find them, and ultimately Rick. As Rick explores a cave leading under the house, he overhears the rest of his family arguing about what to do with their predicament. Jerry suggests turning Rick in, with the main reason of him caring about no one but himself. Everyone else, especially Beth, are willing to put up with Rick's antics and sacrifice their current and future lives on earth so they don't have to lose him, with Summer arguing that you don't love someone in the hopes of a reward and Morty reiterating Birdperson's response to him seeking to abandon Rick during the Armageddon, refuting Jerry by convicting that the family will stick beside Rick even if he wouldn't do the same for them. Upon hearing his family defend him and Beth eventually break down and emotionally confess that she is scared of being abandoned by him again, Rick realizes that despite treating his family badly in the past, they're willing to sacrifice their lives and futures on earth to be with him. This causes him to guiltily reflect on the fact that he's a selfish and destructive person, eventually leading him to have a defining moment in which he decides to turn himself in to the Galactic Federation. Saying goodbye to Morty under the guise of an ice cream run, he flies to a nearby cantina to await his own arrest. En route to the cantina, Rick poses as Jerry to tip off the Galactic Federation on where Rick can be found while asking for his family to be spared where it turns out that the Smiths are not wanted by the Federation.  The Smiths are escorted back to Earth, now a [[Galactic Federation]] protectorate. Jerry is happy when a robotic agent tells him to report to the employment office to be \""assigned a function\"" in order to pay off a debt of 7,000 credits for antidepressant pills, although Morty and the rest of the family seem ill at ease.  Rick is booked and incarcerated in a maximum-security Federation prison, seemingly without bail or parole. A fellow prisoner asks him what he did. \""Everything,\"" Rick glumly replies.  In a post-credits scene, [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] is seen in his apartment watching the show, breaking the 4th wall. He turns off the set, limps over to a table, and, while chipperly addressing the viewers, swallows an inordinate amount of painkillers, noting they are to treat the lingering pain from when Beth shot him in ''[[Total Rickall]]''.

[[File:WeddingSquanchEp.png|thumb]]  == Transcript ==    [Open the Smith family house]      (The Smith Family is sat around a table having cereal for breakfast together.)       [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]]:    The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.     [[Beth Smith|Beth]]:    Jerry, get a job.    (A knock is heard at the front door.)       [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]:    Uh, w-why don t you get it Jerry? you re the man of the house and you don t have a job.     Jerry:      (Sighs and stands up to answer door)      (Jerry opens the door and flinches in fear as a large brain-resembling, automated delivery mechanism [a  courier flap ] hovers into the house and makes its way into the dining room.)       [[Courier Flap]]:      (In an automated machine voice)   Delivery for Rick, Morty, Summer, Beth and Jerry.     [[Summer Smith|Summer]]:      (Drops spoon upon seeing the Courier Flap)   Gross, what   is   that thing?     Rick:    It s a Courier Flap, it s like the Intergalactic version of UPS but less off-putting.   (Reaches hand into courier and retrieves a metallic egg-shaped item)   OH SHIEEET! It looks like an egg-vite from Birdperson! It must be time for his annual Oscar party. By the way, our TV signals take lightyears to reach his planet, nobody tell him that Braveheart wins.    (Rick cracks the egg open like a regular egg. Upon cracking the egg, a miniature hologram emerges with Pachelbel s Canon playing in the background and videos of Tammy and Birdperson.)       [[Birdperson]] s Voice:    Greetings, this is Birdperson.     [[Tammy Guterman|Tammy]] s Voice:    And Tammy!     Birdperson s Voice:    Inviting you to Planet Squanch for our mate-melding ceremony.     Rick:      (With disgust)   Ughhhh...   (Places a napkin over the hologram and takes it to the bin in the kitchen)       Tammy s Voice:      (Muffled by napkin)   If you re not a bird, that means we re getting married!     Summer:    Oh my God! My friend Tammy s marrying Birdperson!     Jerry:    What the hell is a  Birdperson, ?     [[Morty Smith|Morty]]:    He s Rick s best friend.     Rick:    Uhhhh, l-l-let s not get carried away, Morty.     Courier Flaps:    Would you like to RSVP or send a gift?     Rick:    No. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away,   *belch*   I d hang out with Jerry all day.     Courier Flap:    Affirmative. Returning to sender.   (Flies towards front door)       Beth:      No  , hold on, stay...  Courier Flaps.      Courier Flap:      (Turning back around and re-entering dining room)   Staying.     Beth:    Dad, you have a friend that s getting married... that s a   big   deal.     Jerry:      *Scoffs*   it s a big deal he   has   a friend.     Rick:    What do you know about friend  ship  , Jerrrrrry?     Courier Flap:    Confirm, shipping Jerry.   (Hovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into sky)       Beth:    Oh God, Jerry?!   (Runs to front door)       Summer and Morty:    Dad?!   (Follows Beth)       Beth:      (Looking into sky)   Where is it taking him?     Rick:      (Still eating cereal)   I assume Planet Squanch, 6000 lightyears across the galaxy.     Morty:    Wh?-Wh- th-th-that s insane!     Rick:    Yeah, I know. Now we have to go to the wedding.    [Trans. Rick, Summer, Beth and Morty flying through the galaxy in Rick s space cruiser while the radio plays techno music. The cruiser then flies down through the atmosphere of a clouded planet and lands on the surface of Planet Squanch.]       [[Squanchy]]:    Rick Sanchez, you psycho bag of Squanch!     Rick:      (Unscrewing and drinking from scotch flask)   Hey, what s up, Squanchy?     Summer and Morty:      (Morty waves)   Heya Squanchy.     Squanchy:    Morty, Summer! And you must be Beth.   (Kisses Beth s hand)   Au squanch 00e9.     Beth:      (Holding a suit in a dry cleaning bag)   Your language has  squanch,  in it a   lot  . Doesn t that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?     Rick:    Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what s in your squanch and people understand.     Beth:    Oh, okay... I   squanch   my family.    (Rick and Squanchy look at her with disgust and shock.)       Squanchy:    Uhh...     Beth:    What? I do, I squanch my family.     Squanchy:    Just stop saying it, gross.      [[Photography Cyborgs|Photography Cyborg]]:    I am not staring at you. I am Cyborg photographer, just act natural. This is a candid shot, I don t require a camera so...   (An quest looks away.)   Sorry.   (Turns to another quest.)   Hi, I am not staring at you.    (An Squanchy waiter brought an plate with monkey-like head meal to an female, plant alien quest. Opens the lid and revealed out plant food inside, only to cause for the quest to scream then later passed out to the floor.)       Rick:    But, BUT. Here s the thing, Birdperson is my best friend, and if he he loves Tammy, well then I love Tammy too.    (People around clapping and cheers, Beth hold Jerry s hand and smiles, Squanchy takes an collar from his wrist and throws to the floor which that reads Rick s BFF as he s disgusted.)       Rick:    To friendship, to love and to my greatest adventure yet, opening myself up to others!  Summer:      Morty:    Cheers to that, motherfuckers!     Tammy:    Thank you, Rick. That was beautiful. Cuz I look around this room, and I think   \""Uh Tammy, you re a high school senior from the Planet Earth and you re marrying a 40 year old Birdperson\""  , like   \""Whaaat\""  ?    (The quests chuckles.)       Summer:    Yeah Tammy!     Tammy:    Then I think, you know in a lot of ways I m not a high school senior from the planet Earth. In a lot ways what I really am, is a deep-cover agent for the [[Galactic Federation]], and you guys are a group of wanted criminals, and this entire building is in a certain sense surrounded.     Morty:    Huh?     Summer:    What?     Rick:    Oh shit.     Beth:    I don t get the metaphor.     Jerry:    I ll explain it to you later.     Tammy:    Everyone here is under arrested for the crime against the Federation!   (Putting out the Pulse Rifle from the large nest.)       Humanoid Quest:    L chaim!     Birdperson:      (Stands up)   Tammy, what are you doing here?     Tammy:      (Aiming at Birdperson, warning him.)   Sit! Your bird ass, down!     Birdperson:    Tammy?  (Tammy opens fire at Birdperson, killing him and Birdperson collapses to the floor from the nest as Rick and quests watched in shock and horror.)     Birdperson:    Caaww! Caww...     Rick:    Birdperson,   NOOOOOOOO!!      (Squanchy and several lots of quests, revealed to criminals, put out their firearm weapons and opens fire.)       Squanchy:    RAAOOWWARR!!!   (Fatally slaps an Gromflomite his way.)   WHAT ABOUT A TASTE OF MY SQUANCH!!??   (Growls as he fights the rest of the agents and officers.)       Rick:    Come on, this way!    (The Smith family stood up and run, as Jerry take an weapon with him.)       Squanchy:    SQAUSH THIS!!   (Almost stomps on Tammy as she trips.)       Jerry:    I m just saying, we keep acting like there s only two options, but there s not. So, yes, if we went back to earth, as long as Rick was out there, they 2019d want to interrogate us. But, and this is purely hypothetical, what if we turned your father in to the government?     Beth:    Jerry, so help me god, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon.     Jerry:    There already is no more bacon! This world sucks! Our life sucks! Why are we doing this for someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself?     Morty:    That s not the point, Dad! We love Rick! F-For the most part.     Summer:    Yeah, you don t love people in hopes of a reward, Dad. You love them unconditionally.     Beth:    That s very good, kids. I m proud of you.     Jerry:    Okay, so let me get this straight. For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children s futures, we re gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants?     All but Jerry:    Yes.     Jerry:    WHY?!     Beth:    Because I don t want him to leave again, you dumb asshole!     Rick:    Hey, uh, I was gonna hop over to the Gloppydrop System, get some ice cream.     Morty:    You... You want me to come with? I mean, don t you need my brainwaves for camouflage or something?     Rick:    I ll be okay. Bye, Morty.     Morty:    Rick? You re not leaving, right?     Rick:    Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.     Morty:    So you re coming back?     Rick:    Morty, if you go to where there 2019s a bunch of ice cream and then you don 2019t come back, you haven 2019t actually gotten ice cream, you 2019ve just gone where ice cream is.     Morty:    Rick, I can handle it if you go, but you ll break mom s heart, and I won t forgive you for that.     Rick:    Where s the van, Morty?     Morty:    It s over the horizon in the driveway.    [While Rick is flying through space, he dials a number on his phone.]       Operator:      [speaking in an unintelligible language]   For English, press 2.   [Rick pushes a button.]   Connecting to agent.     Female Voice:    Ongoing investigations.     Rick:    Uh, hi. My name is Jerry Smith, I m from Planet Earth. I know the whereabouts of Rick Sanchez, the wanted criminal.     Female Voice:    Hold on!    [The phone is heard ringing as Rick is connected to another officer.]       [[Agent Gribbles|Gribbles]]:    This is Special Agent Gribbles. You have a tip about Rick Sanchez?     Rick:    Yeah, he kidnapped me and my family, and he left us on [[Dwarf Terrace-9]]. He said he was gonna go to the [[Plim Plom Tavern]]. And listen.     Gribbles:    Yes?     Rick:    I m doing what s right for the galaxy by calling you, so if we come back to Earth, can my family have a normal life?     Gribbles:    We only want Sanchez, sir. Your family will be fine.     Rick:    Nice, thank you. I m Jerry Smith, and I love sucking big, sweaty boners and licking disgusting and furry testicle sacks.     Gribbles:    Uh, okay.    (Rick drives to the planet where Plim Plom Tavern is at. Inside the Tavern where Rick is sitting and drinking while looking at the picture of him and his friends at the club. Knowing his friends are gone, standing up and drops the picture to the floor, places some cents on the table and walks out in right time to be only put his hands up, surrounding to the Gromflomite soldiers to be getting arrested.)      (While at the Smith family whose still on Dwarf Terrace-9, knowing that Rick s not coming back.)       Beth:    He s not coming back, isn t he?     Morty:    No.    (The Galactic Federation ships arriving at the planet and lands the surface.)       Jerry:    Hey look, cops!     Gromflomite officer:    Good morning.    (At the [[Galactic Federation Prison]] where arrested Rick is sent there by the landing ship.)       Prison Photography Cyborg:    Sorry. I am not staring at you, I m taking your mugshot.   (Takes a mugshot picture.)      (Rick in his inmate suit, taken by the prison guards. Rick has his tongue pulled and has serum to it for DNA, all kept in classified data, with marking him been so far committed everything as they watched. Soon, Rick s put to an cube like cell and taken in air, incarcerating him inside in the maximum-security room. Afterwards, now places him there, besiding to an [[Splorpians|Splorpian]] and [[Zerillians|Zerillian]] inmates.)       Zerillian prisoner:    Hey, what are you in for?

Rick smells a rat and orders\u00a0[[Jerry Smith (Replacement dimension)|Jerry]]\u00a0to fold himself over 12 times. \""Jerry\"" only manages to contort himself into six folds, revealing that this is, in fact, a simulation based on Rick's memories. [[file:S3e1 mature rick.png|left|thumb|Mature, Rick.]]  A\u00a0[[Galactic Federation]]\u00a0agent named [[Cornvelious Daniel]] sitting in the next booth introduces himself and reveals that he has been sent to gather information from Rick's mind via a [[Series 9000 Brainalyzer|brain-link]]. The agent makes it clear that Rick's brain will be liquefied at the end of the session, so he might as well revisit his memories one last time.  [[file:S3e1 summer an gun rain.png|thumb|Summer finds the portal gun.]]  Meanwhile,\u00a0[[Morty]]\u00a0and his family are back on Earth, which is now being run by the Galactic Federation. Jerry now works\u00a0an unspecified occupation, while Beth has lost her own job due to the Federation's advanced medical knowledge. Unhappy with their current way of life, [[Summer Smith|Summer]] decides to save Rick and digs up the [[Portal Gun|portal gun]] buried by Rick in the backyard next to his own alternate-dimension corpse. Morty tries to dissuade Summer from doing so, but when the family's robot butler [[Conroy]] turns hostile and attempts to confiscate the portal gun, Morty transports them all to his\u00a0\""[[Rick Potion 9|Cronenberg World]]\""\u00a0family, which he and Rick C-137 abandoned previously.  [[file:S3e1 cronen fam.png|left|thumb|Morty's original family, and his replacement Summer in the background.]]  After they arrive, Conroy is destroyed by [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry Smith]] and [[Summer Smith (C-137)|Summer Smith]] from the abandoned [[Cronenberged dimension]]. Morty and Summer join them, along with [[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth Smith]], in a feast of roasted [[Cronenbergs|Cronenberg]]. The cataclysm endured by this dimension affords Morty the proof to Summer that Rick does not care about anyone, especially his family. At this point, Jerry smashes the portal gun, preventing our Summer and Morty from leaving.  [[file:S3e1 trial.png|thumb|A sham trial.]]  Agents from the\u00a0[[Council of Ricks]]\u00a0show up to investigate the compromised portal gun, immobilizing Jerry, Beth, and the other Summer with a freeze ray. As Summer informs the agents that Rick C-137 has been captured, the agents dispatch a [[Seal Team Rick|Rick Council Seal Team]] to assassinate Rick C-137, while Summer and Morty are captured. At the subsequent kangaroo court aboard the [[Citadel of Ricks]], our Summer and Morty speak out against the council in Rick C-137's defense, and Morty reveals that he never gave up on Rick and was just trying to protect his sister from the dangers of life with Rick involved.  [[file:S3e1 beth and diane surprised.png|thumb|left|Beth and Diane.]]  Back in the brain-link simulation, Rick stops by a McDonalds drive-thru, and orders Chicken McNuggets with [[Szechuan Chicken McNugget Sauce|Szechuan sauce]]. Rick then shows the agent a memory of how he lost his [[Diane Sanchez|wife]] and [[Beth Sanchez (C-137)|Beth]] to an explosion in his first [[Dimension C-137|dimension]], driving him to [[Portal Technology|invent]] his first portal gun. The agent collects what he believes to be the genuine portal gun formula and uploads it to the brain-link server. The agent then attempts to leave the brain-link, but his communication device fails. Rick reveals that the \""code\"" given was actually a virus giving him control of the entire system and that the \""memory\"" they visited was a \""fabricated\"" origin story. Rick then transfers his consciousness out of the brain-link into the physical body of the agent.  At this point, the Rick Council Seal Team shows up and kills all of the aliens and [[Rick Sanchez (D-99)|Rick D-99]], a SEAL Team Member shoots Rick C-137\u2019s old body in the head, destroying it. Rick manages to transfer his consciousness from his agent body to Rick D-99. Quickly afterward, another SEAL Team Rick shoots the agent body, killing Rick D-99. Rick C-137 (in his new body) kills the rest of the agents and interrogates a surviving Rick, which the surviving Rick tells him that Morty and Summer are on the Citadel. Rick thanks the last surviving Rick and shoots him in the head.\u00a0  [[file:S3e1 terror rick.png|thumb|Rick transports the Citadel into the Galactic Federation Prison.]]  Rick rappels up a rope and leaves the Galactic Federation Prison and makes his way to the teleportation control room of the Citadel of Ricks by switching his consciousness into a high ranking Rick. He teleports the entire Citadel back into the middle of the federation prison, resulting in a heated battle between the two sides. Rick C-137 infiltrates the Council chamber and kills most of the Council of Ricks before ending up in a standoff with the final member, attempting to use Summer as a hostage.  With a clever bit of trickery, Rick and Morty combine efforts to save Summer and escape back to Earth, but not before Rick returns to the prison's control room and changes the Galactic Federation's currency, [[Blemflarck]]s, so that 1 blemflarck is worth 0 blemflarcks. With the economy in shambles, the Federation follows suit, sending the whole galaxy into chaos and resulting in many aliens leaving Earth.  [[file:S3e1 him or me.png|left|thumb|Rick or Jerry.]]  By the time Rick, Morty and Summer return home, [[Jerry Smith (replacement dimension)|Jerry]] is once again unemployed while [[Beth]] is simply relieved that her family is home safe and sound. Unhappy with his father-in-law's return, Jerry demands that Beth chooses between himself and Rick, leading to the two deciding on divorce.  [[file:S3e1 pilot callback.png|thumb|All he wants is that Szechuan Chicken McNugget Sauce.]]  Once Beth and Summer leave the garage, Rick reveals to Morty that he had himself captured on purpose in order to take revenge on both the Galactic Federation and Jerry for crossing him. By eliminating Jerry, Rick now takes on the role as the undisputed patriarch of the family, and Morty will be forced to continue on adventures with him as both Beth and Summer view Rick as a hero. Rick explains that all he wants out of all his plans is to get [[Szechuan Chicken McNugget Sauce]], which was discontinued by McDonalds years ago. Understandably, Morty is visibly horrified by the revelation.  In the post-credits scene,\u00a0[[Birdperson]]'s\u00a0corpse is reanimated with cybernetic parts and renamed \""Phoenixperson\"". He and\u00a0[[Tammy]]\u00a0fly off into the distance, presumably to take revenge on Rick.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.    Rick:    Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at [[Shoney s]]?     [[Beth]]:    Dad, it s great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn t you like to go home?    Rick:    Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney s is my home.    [[Jerry]]:    Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --     Rick:    Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.    Jerry:    You got it. [ Grunting ]     Rick:    Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a [[Series 9000 Brainalyzer|Series 9000]]? You cheap insect fucks didn t think I was worth your best equipment?    [[Cornvelious Daniel]]:    [ Chuckles ] Man, I told the money bugs. I said, \""You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer.    Rick:    Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don t see the need to leave this part of my brain.    Cornvelious Daniel:    Oh, I think you do. Eventually, you re either gonna relax your cerebellum.    Rick:    Shoney s.    Cornvelious Daniel:    Or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.  [ Farts ]    Rick:    Relaxed enough?

I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don t know what I do.    [[Summer]]:    Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.    Jerry:    Well, when you re not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules.    Beth:    Summer, show your father some respect. He s pulling down a six-chewable figure income. [ Bottle shatters ]     [[Conroy]]:    I ll get that in a moment. How are everyone s pills? Oh, Morty, you ve hardly touched your pills.    Morty:    I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I [muffled] wasn t gonna eat any more pills. [ Gulps ] Thank you, Conroy.    Jerry:    You spoil us, Conroy.    Summer:    [Slams hands on table] Grandpa Rick wouldn t put up with this!    Beth:    [Bangs fist on table] Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.    Jerry:    [Bangs fist on table] Willem Dafoe! Th-That s the guy I couldn t think of this morning.    Beth:    Don t make my mistake, Summer. Don t deify the people that leave you. You ll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses [ Sobs ] healthy forever. [ Sniffles ] Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?     Summer:    Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!     Conroy:    Who saved room for pill br 00fbl 00e9e?     Jerry:    Ooh!

But admit it, Rick -- you re going crazy cooped up in here. Let s go visit some memories.    Rick:    Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?     Cornvelious Daniel:    [ Squeals ]    Rick:    Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you re aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?    Cornvelious Daniel:    It s arousal. Yes, I d like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun.    Rick:    Yeah, well, tough titties. [ Rumbling ]     Convelious Daniel:    There s no tougher titty than a psychotic break, Rick.    Rick:    Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.    Cornvelious Daniel:    Someone special you remember? Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper? [ Whooshing ]     Cornvelious Daniel:    If we stay here, you ll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go she ll be there, too, won t she?

Rick:    [ Sighs ] Fine, but I m driving.    9/11 Memory Rick   : --as an excuse to strip away our freedom! Transition to [[the Garage]]    Morty:    Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?     Summer:    Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.    Morty:    Summer, you re freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn t make things better. And, you know, we re not doing so bad.    Summer:    We re miserable, Morty! There s a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!    Morty:    Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.    Summer:    Because you suck! You ve been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you re freaking stoked to bail on him.    Morty:    He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on [[Dwarf Terrace-9|tiny planet]]! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn t care! Because nobody s special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won t let you down is buried in your backyard!     Summer:    You re right!     Morty:    What?! No, I m not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!  [ Summer grunting ] [ Thunder crashes ]     Morty:    Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!  [ Thunder crashes ]  Transition into Rick s mind    Cornvelious Daniel:    Where are we going?     Rick:    To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.    McDonald s Drive-thru speaker:    Welcome to McDonald s. Can I take your order?    Rick:    Yeah, I d like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you re allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film \""Mulan,\"" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it s delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it s gone. This is the only place we re gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.    Cornvelious Daniel:    Rick, you re doing this bit while your brain is melting.    Rick:    Okay. All right, all right.    Cornvelious Daniel:    Is that--    Rick:    Me. I used to wear blue pants. [ Zapping ]    Cornvelious Daniel:    When d you make the leap to interdimensional travel?    Rick:    I didn t.   I   did. [ Whooshing ]    [[Rick Prime]]   :Well, well, well. If it isn t us. You know the worst part about inventing teleportation? Suddenly, you re able to travel the whole galaxy, and the first thing you learn is, you re the last guy to invent teleportation. Fortunately, you re about to invent something much more powerful.    Cornvelious Daniel:    [ Squeals ]     Young Rick:    What?  Transition to Smith backyard [ Thunder crashes ]     Morty:    Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad s mannequin leg.    Summer:    Fine, stay here. I ll rescue Grandpa myself.    Morty:    And how are you gonna do that?     Summer:    I don t know yet. I ll make it up as I go. That s what Grandpa Rick does. That s what heroes do.    Morty:    Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I ll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-     Conroy:    My goodness, children. [ Stern robotic voice ] Relinquish the illegal technology to the nearest Federation representative. [ Normal voice ] And then we ll all play Balderdash.

I have that exact same top.    Summer:    What is this place? And what s with \""Hunger Games\"" Summer?    Morty:    That s my sister. This used to be my home. Transition to Rick s mind    Rick Prime:    Imagine doing anything you want, then hopping to a timeline where you never did it. Imagine going anywhere, anytime, with nobody able to stop you.    Young Rick:    Sounds lonely.    Rick Prime:    Lonely? Dude, you have yourself -- your infinite selves. It s a nonstop party where all the guests are the only person we like. You think it s cool being the smartest man on Earth, but once we give you this technology, you become the smartest thing in every conceivable universe -- the Infinite Rick, a god.    Young Rick:    Eh, pass.    Rick Prime:    Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don t pass on this. Who do you think you are?    Young Rick:    A different kind of Rick, I guess.    Rick Prime:    Well, we ll see how long that lasts. [ Whooshing ]    [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]]:    I heard sci-fi noises. Did you make a breakthrough?    Young Rick:    Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don t think this science thing is gonna pay off.    Diane:    Well, why don t I get Beth and we ll go out for ice cream?    Young Rick:    That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage. Transition to Smith residence (C-137) [ Munching loudly ]     Summer:    Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you re looking feral. I can t believe Rick did this.    Morty:    These are the parts of Rick s adventures you don t get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it s been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick \""I told ya so.\"" So, uh--    [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry (C-137)]]:    Looking for this?     Morty:    What are you doing with that?!     Jerry (C-137):    It stinks of Rick. [ Grunts ]     Morty:    No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!     Jerry (C-137):    You can never leave. She cannot remain.    Summer (C-137):    She stinks of Rick. Portal opens, Ricks exits through it [ All scream ]     Morty:    Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I m Morty C-137. Ricks look at each other    Guard Rick:    We detected a compromised portal gun. Where is your Rick?    Summer:    He s in prison.    Morty:    Summer.    Summer:    He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.    Guard Rick:    Very troubling. We can t risk [[Citadel of Ricks|Citadel]] secrets falling into the Federation s hands. We ll dispatch [[SEAL Team Ricks]] immediately to break into the prison holding C-137.    Summer:    Boo-yah!    Guard Rick:    Aand assassinate him.    Summer:    Boo-nah?  Transition to Rick s mind [ Horn honks ]     Young Rick:    Come on, girls! The ice cream s gonna melt.    Cornvelious Daniel:    [ Munching ]  Portal opens  [ Whooshing ]  Blinking ball falls through [ Beeping ]     Young Rick:    Nooooooo! Ball explodes, killing Diane and young Beth    Cornvelious Daniel:    Wow. This sauce is fucking amazing. You said it was promoting a movie? [ Slurping ]    Young Rick:    Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I fucking got it. Young Rick opens portal    Cornvelious Daniel:    Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun?    Rick:    Yeah. That s the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.    Cornvelious Daniel:    Awesome-possum. [ Whirring ] Mission Control, you getting this?    Gromflomite Worker:    Holy shit, yes! Yes, we got it!    Cornvelious Daniel:    Yeah! Thanks, Rick. I ll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don t know, don t care. Pull me out. [ Beat ] Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?    Rick:    Nope, they cannot.    Cornvelious Daniel:    Why not?    Rick:    Because the code you just uploaded wasn t actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.    Cornvelious Daniel:    What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can t alter details of a memory.    Rick:    True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story. World around them turns into Shoney s    Cornvelious Daniel:    It s a trap! Abort! I m still in his Shoney s! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney s!    Rick:    Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.    Gromflomite Worker:    Roger that.    Rick:    Okay, have fun in what s left of my brain. I m gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there s not enough room for all my genius, so I m leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.    Cornvelious Daniel:    It s a trap! Abort! We never left his -- [ Farts ] [ Rick laughs ] No! Rick exits the machine in Cornvelious Daniel s body    Cornvelious Daniel/Rick:    Another day, another dollar. Am I right great insect creature or whaaat?!    Gromflomite Captain:    Congratulations, Agent. You ll be highly commended for this.    Cornvelious Daniel/Rick:    Always wait for permission to [burps] feel accomplishment. That s my motto.    Gromflomite Captain:    One thing still perplexes me -- why would Rick Sanchez turn himself in?     Cornvelious Daniel/Rick:    Well, I m just a dumb-ass bug, but it s possible Rick knew he d be interrogated at this facility, where we not only keep our most wanted, but our most sensitive data. Anyone here with level-nine access could [burps] I don t know, collapse a government. I m just gonna go take a dump. Is it cool if I use the level-nine bathroom? W-W-What s the level-nine master access code again?    Gromflomite Worker:    Oh, that s easy. 8-3--    SEAL Team Rick leader:    Yeah! SEAL Team Rick s in the house!  [ Screaming ]    [[Rick Sanchez (D-99)|Rick(D-99)]] Hi, Rick. Bye, Rick. Rick transfers his mind into D-99    SEAL Team Rick leader:    D-99, y-you okay? [ Grunting ]     Rick (D-99)/Rick:    I m bummed I didn t get to give that insect dick a test-drive.    Braided Rick:    Wait, wait, wait, wait! T-The Council of Ricks sent us. We have your Morty and Summer. They re prisoners on the Citadel.     Rick(D-99)/Rick:    Great!    Braided Rick:    [ Grunts ]    Speaker system:    Security breach in room 6755.    Rick(D-99)/Rick:    Lovely. Not only is my plan screwed up, I also forgot how to improvise.    Speaker system:    All security people approach.    Rick(D-99)/Rick:    [ Grunts ]    Speaker system:    Security breach. Transition to Citadel of Ricks    Summer:    A city of Grandpas?    Morty:    It s the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.    Summer:    But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?    Morty:    Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.    Guard Rick:    Not anymore, homey. SEAL Team Ricks turned his unibrow into two brows -- with a bullet. [ Laughter ] Your Rick s dead! Your Rick s dead!  Transition to Citadel communications center    Worker Rick:    Sir, Rick D-99 is returning from the mission alone. Apparently, SEAL Team Ricks suffered heavy casualties.    Commander in Chief Rick:    Bring him in.    Worker Rick:    He says he ll only talk to a Rick with higher clearance.    Commander in Chief Rick:    La-di-da. Give me that. D-99, this is the commander in chief of the Citadel s militia.    Rick(D-99)/Rick:    Go[burps] -- good enough. Rick transfers his mind into Commander in Chief Rick    Commander in Chief Rick/Rick:    He s a spy. Blow him up. I m gonna go take a shit. Transition to room of Council of Ricks    [[Riq IV]]:    Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead?    Morty:    How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.    Riq IV:    It s not fair, you have no rights, and he s not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he s fun. Look at him go.    [[\""Lawyer\"" Morty]]:    [ Laughs ] Ha ha, yeah!    Riq IV:    We ll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?    Summer:    I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That s pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick.    Riq IV:    Morty?    \""Lawyer\"" Morty:    [ Whispers indistinctly ]    Morty:    What? N-No, I don t want to see your Pog collection. I don t renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That s something you can t have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he s not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn t be your hero. He s more like a demon or a super fucked up god.    Riq IV:    Let s not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he s dead.    Morty:    Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick s dead, he s alive. And if you think you re safe, he s coming for you!     Council of Ricks:    [ All grumbling ]     Commander in Chief Rick/Rick:   [ Whistling ]    Teleportation Worker Rick:    Hey, whoa, whoa! What are you doing in here? This area s for teleporting the entire Citadel to somewhere else using only buttons and dials.    Commander in Chief Rick/Rick:    Yeah, well, it s a bad idea to have it designed that way then, isn t it? [ Whirring ]  [ Screaming ]    Teleporter Worker Rick:    What the fuck? We just teleported into a galactic federal prison.    Commander in Chief Rick/Rick:    I m gonna go take a shit. [ Alarm blaring ]    \""Lawyer\"" Morty:    Order in the court! Whoa! What the hell?! Oh, my God!     Kidnapped Morty:    [ Screaming ]    Random Rick:    Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!    [[Hammerhead Morty]]:    Whoa! [ Screaming ] Whoa!    [[Quantum Rick]]/Rick:    The Citadel s been teleported to [burps] Federation space. It s doomed. This has to be C-137, you guys. What are we gonna do?! You know he s coming for us.    Riq IV:    All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.    [[Zeta Alpha Rick]]:    W-W-What the hell is that?

You re gonna need it later.    [[Ricktiminus Sancheziminius]]:    Hold on, hold on. Whoa!    Riq IV:    That s enough, Rick.    Rick:    What -- What s this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You re trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar s Palace here.    Summer:    That s a bluff. He s bluffing, sir. He loves me.    Riq IV:    You re a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them.    Rick:    I came to kill you, bro. That s not even my original Summer.    Summer:    Oh, my God. He s not bluffing. He s not bluffing!    Morty:    R-Rick?    Riq IV:    Why not shoot through her?    Rick:    20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I m encouraging you to do.    Summer:    What the fuck?    Rick:    Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.    Riq IV:    Because you love her!    Rick:    Because it s incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I m super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.    Summer:    I hate you!    Rick:    Not an issue, sweetie.    Morty:    That s enough! Drop the gun, Rick!    Rick:    Morty, I know you re too stupid to get this, but you re really fuckin  this up right now.    Morty:    I m not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!    Rick:    I wasn t gonna let her die, you fuckin  moron!    Riq IV:    Ha!    Summer:    Aww.    Rick:    The point is he thought I was going to.    Riq IV:    I totally did, by the way. You re a fucking moron, Morty.    Summer:    Morty, you fucking idiot!    Rick:    You re a serious fuckin  idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You re the worst! You re as dumb as a bag of sand. [ All yelling ] [ Screaming ] Morty shoots Rick    Morty:    Who s stupid now, bitch?!    Summer:    Morty, we just got him back!    Riq IV:    [ Laughs ] That was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, let s wrap this- Rick shoots Riq IV    Rick:    Good job, Morty. Let s go, kids.    Summer:    What?! What happened?    Rick:    Oldest Rick trick in the book.    Summer:    \""Fake gun, shoot me in standoff.\"" Brilliant.    Morty:    Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note.    Summer:    Can t we just portal home?     Rick:    Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.    Gromflomite Guard:    Freeze!    Rick:    Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.    Morty:    So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?    Rick:    Destroying the [burps] galactic government.    Morty and Summer:    Awesome! Whoa, cool!    Summer:    Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?    Morty:    Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?    Rick:    Good pitches, kids. I m almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero. Transition to Galactic Federation President s office    Federation worker 1:    Mr. President, the Blemflarck s value just dropped to nothing.    [[Galactic Federation President]]:    What do you mean?    Federation worker 1:    I mean, our single centralized galactic currency just went from being worth one of itself to zero of itself. [ Panicked murmuring ]    Galactic Federation president:    Calm down, people. Deploy the galactic militia and declare martial law.    Federation commander:    Yes, sir. Uh, what should I pay them with?    Federation worker 2:    Their payment is the honor they ll feel to serve their -- Wait. Who s paying me to yell at this guy?    Federation worker 3:    I can answer that -- for money.    Federation worker 1:    I never thought I d live to see this day. [ Panicked murmuring ]    Galactic Federation President:    Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen! There s a solution here you re not seeing. (The president shoots himself in the head)    Federation worker 3:    Give me your jacket!    Federation worker 1:    Give me those pants! [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Indistinct shouting ]    Female Office Employee:    There s no rich people or poor people! I want more jackets!

Jerry:    Look, I-I m not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working. [ Gasps ] Oh, I m glad you re okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?    Beth:    Just each other, and I ll never let you go. And I m so sorry I ever did this to us.    Rick:    Guess who dismantled the government?    Beth:    Please don t leave me again.    Rick:    I never will, baby.    Summer:    I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!    Rick:    Jerry, is there any light beer left? It s insane what you miss in prison.    Jerry:    Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time.    Rick:    No, you re right. Where s the vodka?    Jerry:    Beth, it s him or me! [ Beat ]    Rick:    Seems like you guys need some privacy. I ll, uh -- I ll be in the garage. Transition to garage    Rick:    What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man s garage is his castle. [ Workbench Beeps ]    Beth:    Jerry s going to spend some time divorced.    Rick:    Oh, I-I m sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.    Beth:    Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry.    Rick:    For everybody.    Beth:    For everybody. [ Text whooshes ]    Beth:    I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn t move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.    Summer:    Oh, my God. Nancy says they re drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism.    Morty:    Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I m gonna go to my --    Rick:    Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We ve got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.    Morty:    Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That s dark.    Rick:    Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that s different -- no more Dad, Morty.    Morty:    Oh, geez.    Rick:    He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.    Morty:    Oh, fuck.    Rick:    I ve rep[burps]laced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn t have accepted me if I came home -     Morty:   Oh, man.    Rick:    - without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -    Morty:    Oh, man.    Rick:    - or sister I said any of this, I ll deny it -    Morty:    You re gonna deny it.    Rick:    - and they ll take my side because I m a hero, Morty. And now you re gonna have to go -    Morty:    Oh.    Rick:    - and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I ll -- I ll go out and I ll find some more of that \""Mulan\"" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -    Morty:    What are you talking about?    Rick:    - Because that s -- that s what this is all about, Morty.    Morty:    Szechuan?    Rick:    That s my one-armed man! I m not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I m driven by finding that McNugget sauce.    Morty:    McNuggets?    Rick:    I want that \""Mulan\"" McNugget sauce, Morty! That s my series arc, Morty.    Morty:    What the hell?    Rick:    If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.    Morty:    What are you talking about, Rick?    Rick:    That s what s gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.    Morty:    What are you talking about?!    Rick:    Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.    Morty:    What is that?!    Rick:    For 97 more years, Morty!    Morty:    What are you talking about?!

Rick's main goal is to retrieve the powerful Isotope-322, but the adventure is sidetracked by Summer becoming enamored by this dimension, killing the leader of the [[Death Stalkers]] and forming an alliance with them. Though Rick and Morty initially want to go home, Rick sees the Death Stalkers have a large rock-form of Isotope-322 and decides to stick around so he can steal it.  [[file:S3e2 rip scalp.png|thumb|Morty is not handling his parents' divorce well.]] While Summer goes off to kill some people, Rick tries to get Morty to make a distraction by being a ringer in the Thunderdome (or Blood Dome, as the Death-Stalkers call it). Rick inserts a serum that extracts muscle memory from body parts into Morty's arm to give him combat skills, but \""muscle memory\"" apparently includes the memories and personality of said body-parts, giving Morty a left arm with enormous strength that punches Rick before beating up and killing various Death Stalkers in the Blood Dome. Though Morty initially does this against his will, he soon begins venting his frustrations against Jerry for agreeing to the divorce through the arm. Rick tries to get Morty and Summer to leave before the Death-Stalkers notice someone stole the Isotope-322, and Morty's arm reveals the theft, forcing Rick to pull out his [[laser gun]], telling the viewer that they will be right back.   [[file:S3e2 summer rick and morty driving.png|thumb|left|Summer and Morty chase Rick.]] The episode continues with Rick being chased by his grandchildren in separate cars. He tries to convince them that they are merely staying in the world because they do not want to confront their parents' divorce, but ultimately gives up and portals back to his garage, leaving Morty and Summer trapped (albeit willingly) with the Death Stalkers.  [[file:S3e2 intern.png|thumb|Summer and Hemorrhage hook up.]] While in the Blood Dome, Morty's arm recognizes a soldier who killed his wife and children before torturing him, and proceeds to chase him away from the Blood Dome and kills him. With the arm wanting revenge against the soldier's boss, Morty is forced to come along. Meanwhile, Summer strikes up a romantic relationship with the new leader of the Death Stalkers, a guy with a bucket on his head named [[Hemorrhage]].  Wanting to hide their absence from Beth, Rick builds some Morty and Summer robots to both fool and cheer Beth up, but they only succeed in making her cry and leaving to call Jerry.  [[file:S3e2 choke a b.png|thumb|left|left|Armothy's unfinished business.]] Morty and his arm, now dubbed \""Armothy,\"" prepare to take revenge on the soldier's boss. Morty tries to convince Armothy to hold off on revenge so he can continue to vent his frustrations toward the divorce, but soon realizes that like Armothy, he needs to learn to move on. He starts to choke the man to death just as Rick arrives to retrieve him, admitting it would be too much trouble to find a different Morty and Summer to cheer up Beth. He then helps Morty finish off Armothy's murder victim.  [[file:S3e2 living room.png|thumb|Well, this looks familiar.]] Rick and Morty meet up with Summer and Hemorrhage, offering up Isotope-322 and its powers as a peace-offering. Hemorrhage asks for his help in restoring society, which Rick agrees to, supposedly as a way to avoid dealing with his daughter's divorce. Three weeks later, the post-apocalypse has turned into something resembling modern-day suburbia, with Summer stuck in an unfulfilling marriage with Hemorrhage-- one resembling that of Jerry and Beth's.   [[file:S3e2 lets just go home.png|thumb|left|Summer's ready to leave.]]  Frustrated, Summer agrees to return to her Earth with Rick and Morty, realizing Rick had planned the whole thing to teach her there was no running from her problems at home. As they leave, Rick steals the last of Isotope-322, ultimately sending the post-apocalypse world back to where it started before the trio interfered.  [[file:S3e2 run in a stream.png|thumb|He just wants to run in a stream.]] The trio return to their house just as Rick's robot Morty, made to distract Beth, gains sentience, trying to fight his programming and stay alive, only to have his programming overridden before the robots are destroyed by the originals.  {{quote|I want to be alive! I am alive! Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I want to hold you. I want to run in a stream. I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it.|Mechanical Morty}}  Morty remarks to his mother that if Jerry really wanted to stay he would have fought to make it happen: ultimately he either does not care or is not strong enough to do it. Summer visits Jerry and gives him the skull of the first mutant she killed, a creature who made the mistake of looking back while escaping, as a reminder that you should not look back.  [[file:S3e2 loooooser.png|left|thumb|\""Looooser...\""]] In the post-credit scene, Jerry tries to retrieve his unemployment check from the mail but is confronted by a wolf that threatens him and chews up the check, apparently just to make him suffer. The wind calls him a loser again. {{-}}","<poem> [Rick, Morty, and Summer all fall out of a portal into the garage]    [[Morty]]   : [[Summer]], next time we re hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?    Summer   : It s called \""carpe diem\"", Morty. Look it up.    Morty   :   You   look it up! Y-Y-You don t even-You don t even know what it means!    Summer   : That s because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin  all them diems. [Summer hi-fives Rick]    Rick   : Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you re just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I m sorry, Jerry, I didn t see you there. H-How much of that did you hear?     Jerry   : All of it. You were looking right at me. I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.    Rick   : Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist. [Rick begins using a screwdriver on a gun]    Morty   : W-We ll see you every other weekend, though, right?    Rick   : Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom s lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody.    Morty   : Th-That ll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad s leaving!    Summer   : Bye, Dad. Rick, didn t you say you needed my help on an adventure immediately somewhere else I don t care even if it might kill us?    Rick   : I did not, but if you re really that alienated, I m as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer. [Rick shoots open a portal in the ground]    Summer   : I m ready when you a-- [Summer jumps into the portal and exits]    Rick   : Bitch, I was ready yest-- [Rick jumps into the portal and exits]    Jerry   : Bye, sweetie.    Morty   : Well, I-I better--    Jerry:    Sure. Sounds important. [Morty jumps into the portal and exits] [Beth enters the garage]    Jerry:    If you re looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh--    Beth:    Okay. [Beth exits. Jerry begins to walk out of the garage but stops. Some leaves blow in the wind]    Wind: (faint)    Loser...    Jerry   : What? Hello? [Transition to Rick driving Summer and Morty in a turquoise car through the desert, being chased by other cars]    Rick:    Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!    Morty:    They   all   have mohawks!    Rick:    High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him!  [Morty loads a shotgun and shoots at the vehicle behind them, but misses, while Mohawk Guy jumps onto the back of their car]    Mohawk Guy:    Ah! Death Stalker #1: Light them up.    Mohawk Guy:    Ahh! [Mohawk Guy presses a button and self-destructs]    Rick:    Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!    Summer:    Give me your flask! [Rick hands Summer his flask. Summer chugs some alcohol from it, then spits it into the engine, propelling the car forward]    Rick:    Holy shit, Summer for the win!     Summer:    I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth! [A machine begins to beep rapidly.]    Rick:    Here we go. [Rick pulls the car over, as he, Summer, and Morty all exit.]    Rick:    Isotope 322.  [Rick picks up a glowing green shard with a pair of tweezers and puts it into a container. It floats in the container.] This stuff s so powerful, Morty, it makes Isotope 465 look like Isotope 317.    Morty:    Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?! [Morty points towards the car that was coming towards them which is quickly approaching them. Summer grabs a shotgun from the front seat of the car]    Morty:    Summer!    Summer:    Hold on. I want to try something. [Rick shoots the portal gun at the ground, opening up a portal]    Morty:    Rick, can we not leave without my sister?!    Rick:    Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let s go! Grandpa s concern for your safety is fleeting!    [[Colossus]]:    Your blood will be my lotion. [Summer aims the shotgun at Colossus s car, which is now directly in front of her, and shoots at the front tire. The car flips over and Colossus flies out.]    Rick:    Whoa.   That   was cool. [Colossus claws his way away from the ruined car and looks up at Summer]    Colossus   : Kill me, please.    Summer   : Okay, but not because you told me to. [Summmer shoots and kills Colossus]    Morty:    Summer!    Rick:    Okay, getting darker. [Summer turns around to see a fleet of cars coming towards her. She puts one foot on Colossus s dead body.]    Morty:    Jesus Christ. Summer!  [Morty runs towards Summer]    Rick:    Aw, come on. [Rick, annoyed, runs after Morty while taking a gun out of his coat pocket. [[Hemorrhage]] exits his car and puts a fist up to the men behind him, who are also exiting their cars.]    Rick:    Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!    Hemorrhage:    I am Hemorrhage. You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger. We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.    Rick:    Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?    Summer:    They don t have to keep trying to kill us if we join them. They re basically pussies.    Morty:    What is your deal lately?     Rick:    All right, let s get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what s, uh-What s that little bauble you got back there?  [Rick points at a glowing green rock positioned atop a small hill] Th-Th-That s interesting.    Hemorrhage:    That is our glowing rock. We carry it with us for desecration, to remind us there are no gods. [Rick holds up machine which was beeping before and it begins to beep again in the presence of the rock]    Rick:    Kids, weird pitch: let s have this be our new life. Let s be post-apocalyptic scavengers!    Summer:    (grinning) Okay.    Morty:    What?! [Transition to Death Stalkers camp. Rick, Morty, and Summer are waiting in a lunch line.]    Summer:    Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people. I m going.    Rick:    Sounds good. Stay hydrated. [Summer exits]    Morty:    Listen, Rick, Summer s been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don t think this is a great place for her to be right now.    Rick:    Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it s got its charms.    Lunch server:    Bicep or quadricep?    Rick:    Uh... [clears throat] bicep. [The lunch server puts a human bicep onto Rick s plate. Rick takes a piece off of it, observes it, then eats it. He chews it for a while while Morty angrily stares at him]    Morty:    (after a short pause) Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we re still here?  [Rick takes the piece he was chewing out of his mouth]    Rick:    No. Okay, I ll level with you. [Rick grabs Morty by the arm and drags him to the glowing green rock, which some Death Stalkers are happily gathered around]    Rick:    You see that green rock, Morty? It s about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.    Morty:    Isotope 322.    Rick:    Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--    Morty:    Summer just ran off with strangers that have \""Death\"" in their name, and the rest of their name was \""Stalkers\""!    Rick:    Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents   are   going through a divorce.    Morty:    Damn it, Rick, that s what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let s get the \""F\"" out of \""H\""!    Rick:    No, no, no. Morty, there s too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp.    Morty:    \""Distract\""? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show?    Rick:    Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be... [Rick glances over at the [[Blood Dome]]]  Hey, you guys ever use that Thunderdome, or do you just put it up for decoration?    Death Stalker #2:    Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?     Rick:    Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White.    Death Stalker #3:    (offscreen) Ooh, burn! [Rick snaps his fingers and points a finger gun at Death Stalker #3 while winking]    Rick:    The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here?  [Rick points at Morty. The Death Stalkers cheer] I guess I ll see your asses in that dome!    Morty:    Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?!    Rick:    Morty, relax. You re gonna be a ringer. Come here.  [Rick drags Morty by the arm and takes him behind a truck. He pulls out a device] This device extracts and redistributes muscle memory. [Rick sticks the syringe part of the device into a dangling, muscular arm and pulls out some red liquid from it as the arm shrinks] I m giving your body a 10-year course in wasteland combat one limb at a time. [Rick sticks the syringe into Morty s arm] Ow! [Morty s arm begins to swell up and turn into [[Armothy]]] I m working with a mixed bag here, so you may not have perfect coordination, Morty-- [Rick sticks the syringe into another arm and extracts more red liquid, but [[Armothy]] slaps the device out of his hand]    Rick:    Ugh! Hey!    Morty:    I-I didn t do that! [Morty punches Rick with [[Armothy]] and Rick s nose begins to bleed]    Rick:    Okay, this is exciting. We re making some discoveries about muscle memory. [Armothy starts moving Morty toward the Blood Dome]    Morty:    Ooh! Help! Help!  [Armothy grabs onto the Blood Dome. Morty jumps in and crushes a Death Stalker with Armothy]     Death Stalker #4:    Oh, sweet, man!    [[Eli]]:    And so it begins, my pretties!    Morty:    Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible! [Morty chokes another Death Stalker with Armothy]     Rick:    Just stick and moo-[burps]-oove, Morty! Wear him out! [Rick walks towards the glowing rock. Transition to Summer, Hemorrhage, and [[Blue Footprint Guy]] walking through an abandoned city, while Hemorrhage and Blue Footprint Guy shoot and kill some mutants]    Summer:    How come you guys dress like you re in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys?    Hemorrhage:    After the \""boom-boom\"", some adapted to the new truth, and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes, clinging to the lie of the beforefore times. The raidy-rays rotted them away, leaving only their love for the vertvertisements on billyboards.    Summer:    Jesus Christ, did the \""boomy-booms\"" blow up all your \""wordy-word books\""?     Hemorrhage:    You mean dictionaries? [Four mutants charge towards Summer and Hemorrhage. They shoot and kill all of them. Hemorrhage leans over to look at the fallen billboard advertisement. He touches an image of a young boy]    Hemorrhage:    I think I was a child before the boom-booms. I think I looked like this.    Summer:    Want to piss on it?     Hemorrhage:    Get out of my head. [Transition to Morty in the Blood Dome, smashing a Death Stalker s head with Armothy]    Eli:    Ha ha! Whoo! Unbelievable! A new champ!    Morty:    Okay, no more! [Armothy gestures for more]    Eli:    And he wants more!    Morty:    No, I don t! [Armothy does Hulk Hogan s \""I can t hear you\"" pose]    Morty:    Someone, make this stop!  [Another Death Stalker jumps into the Blood Dome] Mister, please get out of here, or you re gonna die! [The Death Stalker runs up to Morty] I have nothing to do with this!  [Summer and Hemorrhage walk up to the Blood Dome]    Summer:    Morty.    Morty:    (while beating up the Death Stalker) Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man!  [Armothy punches off the man s head. Morty looks at Armothy] Thank you. [Armothy gives a thumbs up. Summer runs up to Morty and gives him a hug]    Summer:    Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother! Not that family means anything!    Hemorrhage:    This family does.    Rick:    All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?     Morty:    Rick, I-I-I think I m breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet?     Hemorrhage:    Leave?     Summer:    I m not leaving.    Hemorrhage:    There is no \""leave\"". We are united, or we are enemies.    Rick:    Oh, big guy, no. Nobody s leaving. Don t be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We re in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.    Death Stalker #5:    Hey, the Green Rock is gone!    Death Stalker #6:    (offscreen) Oh, no!    Rick:    Uh, I know why don t we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids? [Armothy pulls the green rock out of Rick s messenger bag] Ooh. [Rick pulls out a gun] We ll be right back. [Transition to Rick driving quickly through the desert, holding a gun and being trailed by Death Stalkers. Summer and Hemorrhage, who are driving together, drive next to him.]    Summer:    Grandpa, you re being stupid! Just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy!    Rick:    Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy! [Rick shoots and kills two female Death Stalkers] They re lame!    Hemorrhage:    Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather! [A Death Stalker with a knife jumps onto Rick s car. Morty pulls up to Rick s car and shoots the Death Stalker, while Armothy drives]    Morty:    Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?     Hemorrhage:    When did I lose control here?     Rick:    Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents  divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!     Morty:    Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can t we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry?  [A Death Stalker with a turret shoots at Rick s car]    Rick:    All right, you know what? Fuck it! [Rick shoots a portal at the ground in front of him. The front of his car falls into the portal while the back gets stuck in the other universe, which causes the car behind him to flip over. Transition to Rick in the front of the car which is hanging from the ceiling of the garage. He begins to exit, but Blue Footprint Guy assaults him from the passenger seat. He begins to choke Rick.]     Blue Footprint Guy:    My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline! [Rick kicks Blue Footprint Guy off of him and he falls under the car, which also falls onto his head, crushing and killing him]     Rick:    Nope, regular blood. [Beth enters from inside the house]    Beth:    Dad?    Rick:    Hi, sweetie.    Beth   : Where are the kids?     Rick:    Oh, th-they aren t with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They re out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don t panic.    Beth:    Not panicked. At all. [Rick pulls out a flask from his coat and nervously drinks] Just...Oh, God, what s the divorce doing to the kids? What s it doing to me? Did I make a mistake?     Rick:    Not a mistake, no! [Rick puts the flask back in his coat] I mean, not that I have a horse in this race, but this divorce decision listen, [Rick does an Italian chef kiss] mwah! Good for you, good for the kids. I mean, honestly, I think that they re flourishing. I mean, you ll see, when when when you see them, that that they re totally flourishing. [Transition to Morty, angrily beating up and killing another Death Stalker in the Blood Dome]    Morty:    Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?  [Armothy waves in front of Morty s face] Hey, what s what s wrong, man? You re not getting weak on me, are you? [Armothy points up at a man sitting in the bleachers outside of the Blood Dome. He is wearing a soldier s armor]    Soldier:    What? Wait a minute. [Transition to a first-person flashback of Armothy chopping wood in a quaint, peaceful village. He stops when he hears a woman scream, and looks up to find houses burning and men riding in on horses, shooting at the villagers with bows and killing a man. Transition to the village burning, with Armothy lying on the ground with a large cut in his wrist. The soldier from the bleachers walks up to him]    Soldier:    What s the matter, you piece of crap? Haven t you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I m gonna whip you. Ha! [The soldier whips Armothy. Transition to present time, with Armothy still pointing at the soldier in the bleachers]    Soldier:    It can t be. It can t be! [The soldier jumps off the bleachers and is running away]    Soldier:    I was just following orders -- [Morty starts getting moved towards the man by Armothy]    Morty:    Whoa, whoa!    Soldier:    -- I was just following orders!  [Armothy swings open the door to the Blood Dome, which knocks over a Death Stalker]    Death Stalker #7:    Ahh!     Soldier:    I ll tell you where my boss lives! He s in the castle! [Armothy punches the soldier into a couch]  He s in the castle! [Armothy picks up a torch and throws it at the soldier, setting him on fire and killing him] Ahh! Aggggh!    Morty:    This isn t over, is it? [Armothy gives a thumbs-down]    Morty:    That means, no, it isn t over, or you disapprove of the question? [Armothy shakes his hand and puts his pointer finger up, then gives another thumbs-down] Uh, m-make a fist if this isn t over. [Armothy makes a fist] This isn t over. [Transition to Hemorrhage, using the a wrench on the engine of a car. He throws the wrench onto the ground]    Hemorrhage:    Ugh! [Summer enters]    Summer:    Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car.    Hemorrhage:    We don t apologize, and we have no god. But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain. There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.    Summer:    What about the weird guys on leashes, then?    Hemorrhage:    They re more like interns. [Hemorrhage pulls out an adjustable wrench from behind him]    Summer:    Cool, cool. [Hemorrhage drops the wrench. Summer and Hemorrhage both reach for it.]    Summer:    Sorry.    Hemorrhage:    It s okay. [Summer touches Hemorrhage s helmet]    Summer:    Can I see?     Hemorrhage:    No one has seen my true face and lived.    Summer:    Well, I m not afraid to die, and I don t care what you look like. [Hemmorhage starts to pull off his helmet. Summer gasps. Hemmorhage pulls off his helmet. He is a blonde man with a mustache.] Oh.    Hemorrhage:    Hmm?     Summer:    I just...I didn t expect you to have a mustache.    Hemorrhage:    You hate it.    Summer:    No. I like it. I guess -- How do I explain this? A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of \""mustache,\"" in that it s a specific facial accessory. So, it s kind of like...Do you guys have the phrase \""hat on a hat\""?     Hemorrhage:    I can shave it.    Summer:    No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn t matter. It s you.    Hemmorhage:    Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter. Obviously, I know that. I m not weak. I m just thinking, \""Well, why not get rid of this?\"" You just kill everyone that sees it, and it s and it s hot under here (looks at helmet) wh-which, by the way, is why I shave the beard part. So, right there, I m making a decision based on vanity, which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself? Why don t I just wear a tie, right? I mean, it s like that guy you killed when I met you, with the burnt dolls on his body. I hated that guy, because, why-why are you doing that? And how can you not see how fake that is? And the whole time, I m the same thing. I m just a fake mess, and there s no escaping it because -- [Summer kisses Hemorrhage. They start making out on a table. A man in a mask on a leash crawls into the hut]    Leash Man:    Hey, I m doing a coffee run -- Never mind. [The man on the leash crawls back out. Transition to Rick, positioning the head of [[Mechanical Summer]]. He flips a switch on the back of her neck]    Mechanical Summer:    I am Summer.    Rick:    Summer, state your deal.    Mechanical Summer:    My deal is that I am, like, totally fine.    Rick:    Morty?     Mechanical Morty:    Aw, geez, I m so down with my parents  divorce, dawg. Like, don t even trip, like, in a healthy way.    Rick:    All right. [Rick rubs his hands together]    Rick:    It s dinnertime. [Transition to the dinner table. Beth drinks a glass of wine]    Beth:    Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner.    MS, MR, and Rick, in unison:    No problem.    Mechanical Summer:    Its benefits are totally, like, less about the food than the emotional nourishment.    Beth:    Uh, okay, weirdo. [laughs]    Rick:    Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right?     Beth:    How s school, Morty?    Mechanical Morty:    I like school and stuff, kind of. And I m getting better grades than when you and Dad were -- quote mode -- \""staying together for the kids.\"" End quote mode.    Beth:    \""Quote mode\"". I like that. You millennials. Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?     Mechanical Summer:    All I know is, totally, you look great.    Mechanical Morty:    Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff. It s crazy.    Mechanical Summer:    So happy.    Mechanical Morty:    So happy. Happy family, man. We got this family in the bag. [Beth starts to cry]    Rick:    Oh, sweetie, d-don t. Listen. Don t --     Beth:    I don t know why I m crying. It s not --    Rick:    Well, try crying 15% less?    Mechanical Summer:    Mom, emotions are human. You re not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.    Mechanical Morty:    Yeah. Geez, Mom. Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp.    Beth:    I have to call Jerry. [Beth gets out of her chair and walks to the kitchen]    Rick:    You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.    Mechanical Summer:    Your feelings are coming from a -- [Rick flips the switch on the back of Mechanical Summer s neck. She turns off and her face falls into the spaghetti]    Rick:    Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.    Mechanical Morty:    Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti -- [Rick turns Mechanical Morty off and his face also falls into his spaghetti. Transition to Morty and Armothy sneaking into a castle. They fight and kill two guards. Transition to the [[Slaveowner]] sitting in a bathtub, with two blonde boys sitting on either side of him]    Slaveowner:    Graze my genitals again, [[Taint Washer]], and you ll be shipped to the wasteland. And as for you, [[Genital Washer]] -- [Morty bursts in through a window]    Morty:    Ahh! Oh, gee!  [Genital Washer and Taint Washer run out of the room. Two soldiers charge towards Morty. Armothy kills them both, picks up one of their swords and drops it. He moves Morty towards the slaveowner and cracks his knuckles]    Slaveowner:    Oh, god. Look, whoever you are, you should know that killing me won t change a thing.    Morty:    L-Look, man, I m just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you re preaching to the choir here.    Slaveowner:    Please. Slavery was a family business. I didn t ask to be born into it. If anything, I m the victim here!    Morty:    Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir. [Morty turns away from the slaveowner] So, this is it, isn t it? This is the guy?  [Armothy shakes his fist \""yes\""] So, does that mean you ll be going away? Like, does it work like a ghost? Like, is is this your unfinished business?  [Armothy gives a \""so-so\"" gesture] Wh-What if we didn t do it? What if we just went back to the Blood Dome and just kept taking our baggage out on unrelated people? [Morty tears up] I mean, w-we could do that forever. I mean, I-I know it s less healthy, but w-w-we d be together and -- [Armothy puts a \""hush\"" finger up to Morty s mouth]    Slaveowner:    I mean, I-I know what I d vote for, if you re feeling out the room. [Armothy points at the slaveowner, then wipes away Morty s tears]    Morty:    You re right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents  divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you. [Armothy and Morty hug/Morty hugs himself]    Slaveowner:    Aw, fuck! [Armothy starts to choke the slaveowner, while Morty notices that Rick is holding some vials on the other side of the room]    Morty:    Rick?     Rick:    Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don t let me distract you.    Morty:    Yeah, well, too late. [Armothy dunks the slaveowner s head underwater] Just tell me what you want.    Rick:    I want you and your sister to come home.    Morty:    Oh, but don t don t you have infinite versions of me and my sister?    Rick:    You don t have to kick me while I m down, Morty. Look, there s no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose. [Armothy continues to choke the slaveowner underwater. The slaveowner loses consciousness]    Morty:    Maybe the lesson we ve learned is that, whether it s our parents  marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.    Rick:    I don t know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty. [The slaveowner starts gasping for air in between gargles of water]    Morty:   Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I --    Rick:    Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it s gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn t the arm of a paramedic. Here. [Rick takes Morty s hand and puts it around the slaveowner s throat, choking him] It s the least I can do. I-I-I-I owe you this much. See, Morty? Now we re   both   accountable. [Transition to Summer and Hemorrhage driving a car through the desert, with a fleet of other cars next to them, with Rick and Morty driving towards them from the opposite directiion. Summer and Hemorrhage pull their car over and so do Rick and Morty. The four exit their vehicles with Rick holding the glowing green rock.]    Rick:    The reason I wanted this is because it can do this. [Rick puts a lightbulb on top of the rock and it lights up] This is a really special thing. I mean, you could use it to power all your vehicles. You wouldn t be reliant on gasoline. You ll be the most advanced tribe of radioactive cannibals in the whole -- [Rick gives the rock to Hemorrhage] -- this version of the world. [Rick shoots a portal at the ground and starts walking towards it]     Hemorrhage:    Wait. Can you stay to show us more?     Rick:    You don t have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter s going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all. [A title card reads \""THREE WEEKS LATER\"". Transition to an overhead shot of the Death Stalkers  village, which is now a suburb with wires providing power with Isotope 322. Transition to Summer, pulling into a driveway, wearing armor with her hair disheveled. A grocery bag in the car filled with human limbs is knocked over and some fall out. Eli is mowing his lawn next door.]    Summer:    Ugh. Goddamn it. [Summer picks up the limbs that fell out and holds the grocery bag along with a purse]    Eli:    Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today?     Summer:    Oh, you know, Eli. Same shit, different day.    [[Eli s Girlfriend]]:    Hey, Summer! Guess what. One man entered, one man comes out in nine months. [Eli s Girlfriend pats her stomach]    Summer:    Oh, congratulations, guys. [Summer pulls a keyring out of her bag]    Eli:    Uh, Summer, one more thing. We noticed that you ve been putting scrap metal in the blue bin --    Summer:    I got it. [Summer exits into her house]    Eli s Girlfriend:    She s a piece of work.    Eli:    They both are, right? [Transition to Summer inside the house. Rick, Morty, and Hemorrhage all sit on a couch, watching television. Hemorrhage is dressed in a \""Big Johnson\"" t-shirt and navy pants]    Summer:    I m home.    Hemorrhage:    Hey, babe.    Rick:    Ah, Summer s home.    Morty:    Hey, there she is! [Rick takes a drink from his flask]    Summer:    You haven t moved since I left to scavenge this morning.    Hemorrhage:    Blood Dome playoffs.    Summer:    So, I can assume you haven t murdered a single person today.    Hemorrhage:    Oh, I don t know. I-I didn t mark my murders in my murder log. I didn t know that s how we measured success.    Summer:    Oh, there he is. There s the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I m talking to him and everything means everything when it s on fucking TV!     Hemorrhage:    Jesus Christ, when did you become a monster?    Summer:    I was a monster when you met me!   We   were monsters! We didn t care about anything!     Hemorrhage:    I still don t!     Summer:    Yeah, except I m the only one in this entire world that s still committed to that! [Hemorrhage stands up from the couch]     Hemorrhage:    Ohh! Ding, ding, ding! [Hemorrhage pantomimes ringing a bell] Wow. Everybody hear that? Wow.    Rick:    Uh, we should go to the garage. [Rick gets up and exits the room]    Hemorrhage:    Oh, my God.    Morty:    Uh-huh. [Morty follows Rick and exits]    Hemorrhage:    La-di-da-di-fucking-da. The only one committed to not caring?! [Transition to Rick and Morty standing in the garage]    Morty:    I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn t -- I wasn t sure it was gonna work. [Rick pulls a suitcase from underneath a table and puts it on the table. He opens it and a rock of Isotope 322 sits inside]    Rick:    Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society. [Summer enters from the house]    Summer:    Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.    Rick:    Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other. [Summer takes off her metal shoulder pauldrons and tosses them onto the ground, while Rick grabs some things from the garage and puts them into the suitcase]    Summer:    Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point, I get it. Let s just go home.    Rick:    Coolsies. [Rick shoots a portal into the ground. Morty and Summer jump in and exit, and Rick follows them, but stops to grab a rock of Isotope 322 from a machine which was powering the town s electricity. The power shuts off.    Hemorrhage:    (offscreen) Noooooooooo! [Transition to Beth, Mechanical Morty, Mechanical Summer, and [[Mechanical Rick]] playing a dice game called \""Downbeat\"", similar to Yahtzee. Beth presses a button]    Beth:    Downbeat!    Mechanical Rick:    I enjoy this game. [Mechanical Morty, Mechanical Summer, and Mechanical Rick all look at their watches in unison] We must go into the garage.    Beth:    Guys, come on. We never get to finish this game.    Mechanical Summer:    We will return, possibly in different clothing.    Mechanical Morty:    Why do we have to go into the garage?    Mechanical Rick:    You know [burps] it is [burps] required.    Mechanical Morty:    I want to be alive! I am alive! Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I want to hold you. I want to run in a stream. I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it.    Beth:    What the fuck?    Mechanical Morty:    Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiii...Hello. [Mechanical Morty, Mechanical Summer, and Mechanical Rick exit into the garage. Clanking noises are heard offscreen. Morty, Summer, and Rick enter]    Rick:    Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks. [Summer and Morty hug Beth]    Beth:    What the hell just happened?     Rick:    Ah, I m sure it was nothing. I m gonna go, uh, work in the garage.    Beth:    We re not gonna finish playing Downbeat?     Rick:    What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, \""Downbeat\""? No, thank you. [Rick exits]    Summer:    Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad?     Beth:    Sure.    Summer:    Thanks. [Summer exits]    Beth:    Morty, are you okay?     Morty:    You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he d stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn t want you back, or maybe he just doesn t have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he s got his life, I got mine.    Beth:    Yeah. Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?    Morty:    What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on. [Morty rubs his arm. Transition to Summer, knocking on a motel door reading \""826\"". She is holding a skull and is now dressed in her regular clothing. Jerry opens the door]    Jerry:    Summer.    Summer:    This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone. I was raiding his hovel. He had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn t do, which is why I shouldn t believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back.    Jerry:    Thanks. [Jerry takes the skull from Summer]    Jerry:    I know the perfect place for it, which is why I m going to put it somewhere else because everything s bullshit, am I right? [Summer embraces Jerry]    Jerry:    Cool. [Summer lets go of Jerry]    Summer:    So lots of hookers outside, huh?    Jerry:    Is   that   what they are? [Transition to Jerry at a mailbox, whistling, taking out some mail and holding a bag of chips. He turns around and sees a wolf]    Jerry:    Ahh! H-Hello there. Nice doggy. You-You want a snack? You-You want my unemployment check? [The wolf growls] You can tell the difference? [The wolf growls] And you want this one? [The wolf growls]  But this is actual food, and this would nourish you. And this it s just paper that only has value to me. Unless my suffering is your nourishment? [The wolf howls]  Jesus, okay. [Jerry puts the envelopes with his unemployment checks in the wolf s mouth. The wolf chews them up, then spits them out onto the ground. It walks away. Jerry stands still, holding the bag of chips.

He follows the voice to the garage to find that Rick has turned himself into a pickle \""because he could.\"" Beth and Summer appear and notice Rick's pickle status as well. Morty suspects that Rick did this to avoid going to the therapy session, noticing a dangling syringe rigged to inject Rick the moment the others leave. Rick denies the idea of getting out of going and claims the syringe to be irrelevant. In response, Beth removes the syringe, puts it in her purse, and leaves with her children.  Now alone on the table, Rick starts making random sounds when a cat named Izzy appears. Rick tells the cat to back off stating that he has seen Youtube videos with cats attacking pickles because cats are afraid of snakes and think pickles are snakes. The cat knocks Rick over, pushing him outside of the garage and exposing Rick to the sun. Rick grudgingly states how dying in a pickle-form from the heat is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet. Fortunately, a timely rain shower saves him from that fate.  [[file:S3e3 rick falling into sewer.png|thumb|Rick falls into the sewers.]]  However, the resulting rush of water flushes Rick into the sewer drain forcing him to survive in the sewers. Rick creates a bit of pickle juice and lures a cockroach towards him. The cockroach is killed by Rick with a bite to the head and he removes part of the cockroach's head. Rick uses the brain of the cockroach to propel himself forward.  At the counseling office, we learn that the therapy session has been advised by the school, for Summer huffing pottery enamel and Morty wetting his pants in class, both believed to be signs of protesting their parents' divorce. Mr. Goldenfold runs into them on his way out: he was in for eating poop and asks the others if they're in for the same. Beth, Summer, and Morty are greeted by Dr. Wong, the therapist, and their therapy session begins. Beth talks about how Rick couldn't attend and how he is a genius. Morty blurts out that Rick turned himself into a pickle. Dr. Wong uses this idea to start a discussion about why Rick turned himself into a pickle.  [[file:S3e3 rick set up.png|thumb|left|\""OH YEAH!\"" Rick's disgusting suit of rats parts.]]  Rick is seen cutting a sewer grate using a makeshift exo-suit of decapitated roaches. As he is pondering his next move (to a sewer line), a sewer rat appears and tries to attack Rick. Rick uses an elaborate trap to decapitate the unwary rodent. Rick then taunts the other rats that arrived and puts the dead rat's head on top of another contraption, creating a rat version of an exo-suit. The sewer bars break open with the rats pouring in and Rick begins to kill every rat in sight with various small items, including screws and box-cutters.  [[file:S3e3 Mooom.png|thumb|\""MOM!\"" Beth continues to be both in denial and uncooperative.]]  Inside the counseling office, Beth talks about how Rick is important. Summer replies back and says how Rick lied and turned himself into a pickle avoid the counseling session. Beth yells that Rick did not. Dr. Wong notices how the use of science is a common form of communication for the family and discusses this. Dr. Wong asks what could be inside the syringe with them replying it's a liquid that can change Rick back into a human. Beth disagrees and gets angry. She flips out and delivers f-bombs to both Dr. Wong and the siblings.  [[file:S3e3 hero pose.png|thumb|left|Rick lands in the hero pose.]]  Rick has just killed the largest and toughest rat and enters the sewer pipe using rockets. He lands out of a toilet and exultantly yells, \""PICKLE RIIICK!\"" He leaves the men's bathroom and begins to search for an exit. He stumbles upon an elevator and moves some nearby objects to allow himself to parkour towards the elevator door button.  [[file:S3e3 recycling shaming.png|thumb|A pickle shames them for not recycling.]]  Rick is approached by some agents who speak Russian and begin shooting at Rick. Rick runs into a room and starts building weapons with office supplies. Rick taunts the Agency Director of the building while killing all the agents using traps bombs and a laser gun. The Agency Director uses a last resort method and calls upon a captured fighter named [[Jaguar]] to kill Rick.  Back in therapy, Dr. Wong asks what is in the syringe with Beth replying that Dr. Wong should say it, while the siblings say it is anti-pickle serum. Dr. Wong talks about the serum with Beth cutting her off. Beth talks about how the session is supposed to be about the siblings being angry that she divorced Jerry. Morty starts to notice interesting features of the therapy room, particularly how there is a book displaying people eating feces. Dr. Wong says she isn't going to take sides and states that Beth admires Rick. Beth blatantly says it is better than making other peoples' problems, which Dr. Wong questions if that is the reason she looks up to him.  [[file:S3e3 staple pickle.png|thumb|left|\""OW\"" Rick staples on a pickle slice to treat his wound.]]  Rick and Jaguar begin fighting, leading to them both becoming wounded and treating their injuries, leading to them both talking about their motives. Rick proceeds to destroy all the cameras while fighting Jaguar. The Agency Director receives a call from Rick, saying \""Jaguar couldn't make it\"", with Rick remarking that he'll hunt down the Agency Director. The Agency Director offers 100 million dollars in bonds but Rick demands it be given to Jaguar's daughter when she's set free. The Agency Director says she's dead, and Rick refuses to reason with the Agency Director, who then kills the two remaining guards and flees to the roof to get to a helicopter.  [[file:S3e3 look up defeated.png|thumb|The director looks up defeated.]]  The helicopter flies away with Jaguar steering it and Rick, using a cigarette, creates an explosion that kills the Agency Director. Jaguar and Rick talk about their families, to which Jaguar ends by leaving. Jaguar is seen in a comic style flash ending.  The family is seen using simple sentences to describe what they currently want: Summer and Morty admit that Summer's sniffing enamel and Morty's desk wetting have nothing to do with the divorce: one is just for getting high and the other is a mere accident.  [[file:S3e3 wong explains.png|thumb|left|The wonderful Dr. Wong lays down some facts.]]  Rick appears, badly injured, and joins them, asking Beth for the serum that will, indeed, turn him back into a human. Rick says he turned himself into a pickle because he doesn't respect therapy, and therefore, didn't want to go, claiming therapy is for boring people and he does not need it. Dr. Wong agrees that going to therapy, or rather taking the time to repair relationships with your family, is boring, but boring in the way that brushing your teeth or performing bathroom hygiene is not an adventure: there's no way to do it in a way that you can die, it is just about putting in work, and that perhaps some people would rather die than put in the work. Rick has no retort to this, and the session ends.  [[file:S3e3 truly awful parental units.png|thumb|Summer and Morty are ignored by some truly terrible parents.]]  On the ride home, Rick apologizes to Beth for lying to her and Beth responds by injecting him with the syringe, finally turning him back into a human. Rick and Beth plan to go get a drink after dropping the siblings off while ignoring Summer and Morty asking if they'll ever go back to therapy.  In the post-credits scene, Rick and Morty are tied up on a giant piano and are about to be killed by Concerto. Rick says how he is sorry for getting Morty into this situation and believes that they will definitely die. Unpredictably, Jaguar appears, kills Concerto, and leaves. Morty asks who that was and Rick replies, \""That Morty, is why you don't go to therapy\"".",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

[Morty stops combing, looks around, then continues combing]     Pickle Rick:    (offscreen, in the distance) Morty!     Morty:    Rick?     Pickle Rick:    (offscreen, in the distance) Hey, Mooorty!    Morty:    Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?  [Morty opens a cabinet beneath the bathroom sink] Is this a camera? [Morty tries to look inside his comb for a camera] Is everything a camera? [Morty nervously glances around]    Pickle Rick:    (offscreen, in the distance) Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage! [Transition to Morty entering the garage. There is a pickle and a screwdriver on Rick s work bench]     Pickle Rick:    Morty?    Morty:    Rick? W-where are you?    Pickle Rick:    On my work bench, Morty.    Morty:    Are you invisible and you re gonna, like, fart on me?    Pickle Rick:    Flip the pickle over.    Morty:    What, I m gonna touch it, and you re gonna tell me it s an alien dick or something.    Pickle Rick:    Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You re not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. [Morty hesitantly picks up the screwdriver and turns the pickle over. The pickle has Rick s face on it] I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal: I m a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!        Morty:    And?     Pickle Rick:    \""And\""? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?    Morty:    Was it?    Pickle Rick:    Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here s something that s never happened before: I m a pickle. I m Pickle Rick!    Morty:    Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?     Pickle Rick:    I don t do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner.    Morty:    Well, can you move? Can you fly?     Pickle Rick:    I wouldn t be much of a pickle if I could.    Morty:    All right, well, do pickles live forever or --     Pickle Rick:    Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I m a pickle.    Morty:    I-I m just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.    Pickle Rick:    The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can t, would be because they could, which they can t. [Beth and Summer enter the garage from the house. Beth is wearing a midi mahogany pencil dress while Summer is wearing a shorter pink dress with a hot pink jacket, along with black stockings and black heels]    Beth:    Morty, we have to get going, or we re gonna be late. Where s your grandpa?     Pickle Rick:    Right here, sweetie. I m a pickle!     Beth:    What?! Why would you -- Look, we re running late. We have to go.    Pickle Rick:    Where are you guys going?    Beth:    We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you.    Pickle Rick:    Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I m a pickle. I mean, I don t know if I can, ooh, geez.    Morty:    Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?    Beth:    Morty!    Pickle Rick:    It s okay, Beth. I understand Morty s suspicion. I ve misled him before. Morty, turn me so we re making eye contact. [Morty turns Pickle Rick s face so that it is facing him] Morty, I assure you, I would never \""find a way\"" to \""get out of\"" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn t prevent the perception of my air quotes.    Summer:    Can t you just turn yourself back into a human?    Pickle Rick:    Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I m able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.    Beth:    Nobody needs anything! Okay, it s fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?     Morty:    Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?     Pickle Rick:    Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation. [Beth cuts off the syringe and takes it]    Beth:    Enough. Kids, it s time to go. We don t want to be late. [Beth puts the syringe in her purse]    Pickle Rick:    W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?    Beth:    Well, I mean, you don t want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How s that gonna help?    Pickle Rick:    Can t argue with that.    Beth:    Great. We ll see you later. [Beth, Summer, and Morty enter the car.]    Pickle Rick:    Hey, hey, be careful with that. It s for something else. It s really important, so don t break it. [Beth drives away with Summer and Morty. They all exit.]    Pickle Rick:    Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah. [clicks tongue] [[Izzy]] walks in through the open garage door and jumps onto Rick s work bench. She sniffs around]    Pickle Rick:    Oh, great. Stupid cat. [Izzy sniffs Pickle Rick and hisses]    Pickle Rick:    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I m not a snake! I ve seen the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNycdfFEgBc YouTube videos], I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they re snakes. I m not a snake! I m a pickle, I m a pickle! [Izzy bats at Pickle Rick and knocks him off of the work bench, causing him to roll down the driveway]     Pickle Rick:    Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [Pickle Rick is directly facing the sky]    Pickle Rick:    Oh, crap, that sun is bright. [Pickle Rick begins to sweat]    Pickle Rick:    Okay, come on. This can t really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet. [Pickle Rick starts to shrivel up]    Pickle Rick:    So... hot. This is how I m gonna die. [Thunder can be heard and the shadow of a cloud appears overhead. It starts to rain. Pickle Rick stops shriveling]    Pickle Rick:    Oh, God, moisture. [The rain gets heavy and it begins to flood]    Pickle Rick:    Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here! [Pickle Rick starts rolling down the road]    Pickle Rick:    Oh! Oh! [Pickle Rick rolls towards a sewer grate]    Pickle Rick:    Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular! [Pickle Rick rolls into the sewer grate and falls into the sewer]     Pickle Rick:    Oh, SHIIIIIT!!! Oh! Oh! Oh!  [Pickle Rick hits many pipes before eventually falling onto a solid surface. There are bugs crawling around. One bug walks up to a pile of dirt. Pickle Rick bites his lip and pickle juice comes out. The bug turns around]    Pickle Rick:    Come on. That s it. [The bug walks towards Pickle Rick]    Pickle Rick:    Come get this delicious brine. [The bug is in front of Pickle Rick. Pickle Rick bites on its head and squeezes it until the bug dies.]    Pickle Rick:    Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on! [Pickle Rick licks off the top of the bug s head, revealing its brain. He then licks part of the brain and the bug s leg moves. He rolls onto the bug and licks its brain, moving its legs forward and moving him forward with it]    Pickle Rick:    Yes! [Transition to Beth, Summer, and Morty sitting in a waiting room outside of [[Dr. Wong]] s therapy office. Beth is reading a magazine, while Summer sits with her head resting on her fist. The door to her office reads: \""Dr. WONG / FAMILY THERAPY / COPROPHRAGIA RECOVERY\"". There is a motivational picture of a man eating a hot dog which reads \""COURAGE\"" underneath it.]    Summer:    How is this even family therapy if Dad s not invited and Grandpa won t come?    Morty:    Yeah, and what s courageous about eating a hot dog?    Beth:    It s nobody s choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by   your   principal, even though it s not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class. [[Mr. Goldenfold]] enters through [[Dr. Wong]] s door.    Mr. Goldenfold:    Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You re patients of Dr. Wong, too?    Beth:    Temporarily. By order of the school.    Mr. Goldenfold:    Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?     Summer:    We... have never... eaten poop.    Mr. Goldenfold:    Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to? [Mr. Goldenfold exits. Dr. Wong opens her door and enters the waiting room]    Dr. Wong:    Smith family, I m Dr. Wong. Come on in. [Beth, Summer, and Morty exit the waiting room and enter Dr. Wong s office. Dr. Wong flips the motivational image over to another motivational image of a nuclear family which reads \""DEDICATION\"". Transition to Beth, Morty, Summer, and Dr. Wong sitting down in Dr. Wong s office.]    Dr. Wong:    I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?    Beth:    He got wrapped up in an experiment. He s a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --     Morty:    He turned himself into a pickle.    Beth:    Morty, Mom s talking. I m sorry, I suppose that s a good segue into our little discipline cases here.    Dr. Wong:    Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?    Beth:    What? No, what kind of question is that?    Dr. Wong:    The kind that wasn t designed to attack or hurt you in any way.    Beth:    Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He s unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which... [Beth turns towards Summer and Morty]    Dr. Wong:    Okay, let s open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle? [Beth rolls her eyes. Transition to Pickle Rick, who has attached the bug s limbs to his pickle body and has managed to use them to move. He is looking through a grate, and is rubbing the end of one of the bug arms against one of the bars]    Pickle Rick:    Wow. Ugh. [A rat appears behind the grate and starts scratching at Pickle Rick, screeching]    Pickle Rick:    Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine. The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them. [The rat breaks open one of the bars and continues to scratch. Pickle Rick starts to walk backwards.]    Pickle Rick:    You are one driven rat. Could you be a little more driven? To the right. [Pickle Rick scratches at a rope which is attached to a bug s arms which is holding a razor that it lets go of which is propelled upwards which breaks a rubber band which is tied to a sharp broken bottle which falls on the rat s head and chops it off, killing the rat] [Pickle Rick picks up the rat s head]    Pickle Rick:    Yes, yes, yes! Come on, come on, come on! Fresh, fresh, fresh! [A mischief of rats appears behind the bars, also scratching at Pickle Rick, who is not in their range.]    Pickle Rick:    Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend? Don t worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb fucking rat. [Pickle Rick puts the rat s head onto a bottle cap which starts a machine which lifts him up and takes off his bug limbs. The machine then splits open the rat head and rips out its brain, then puts Pickle Rick down and begins nailing the rat s body parts to Pickle Rick s pickle body. It then sticks a needle into the brain which connects it to the limbs. Pickle Rick runs towards the rats and begins killing them.]    Pickle Rick:    Oh, yeah! Aaaah! [He takes out a machines on his wrists which are loaded with screws. He kills some of the rats. The screws disappear and x-acto blade pop out. He kills more rats. Transition to Dr. Wong s office.]    Beth:    I didn t say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.    Summer:    And she s saying what s important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.    Beth:    Oh, he did not!     Dr. Wong:    Let s do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe. [No one raises their hand.] Raise your hand if you know for certain the syringe does not contain anti-pickle serum. [Beth begins to raise her hand but stops herself.] Beth, your hand did a little thing there.    Beth:    Do you really not see what s happening here?    Dr. Wong:    Tell me.    Beth:    Well, Dr.   Wong   -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.    Dr. Wong:    Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family s dysfunction. I think it s possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don t think it s one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it s possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings. [A short pause]    Beth:    Fuck you.    Morty and Summer, in unison:    Mom!    Beth:    Fuck both of you, too. [Transition to Pickle Rick, fighting a much larger grey rat and beating it up.]    Pickle Rick:    By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That s because, to me, you aren t special. [Pickle Rick pins the rat to the wall with some screws.] You were special to rats. Now they re dead. I guess it was me you should have impressed. [Pickle Rick slices open the rat s stomach with his x-acto blade.] God damn it, I love myself. [Pickle Rick walks up to a pipe above him. His wrist machines fall off and are replaced with a jet pack. He pulls a hood over his head with a rat s face on it. He turns on the jet pack and flies out of the pipe and out of a toilet.]    Pickle Rick:    Pickle Riiick! [Pickle Rick opens the door. It is a bathroom door with a \""male\"" sign on the front. He starts running around and opening various doors and looking in. Eventually he runs up to an elevator and tries to jump up to the buttons but cannot reach them. He tries to scale the wall but fails. He pushes a garbage can and a potted plant next to each other in front of the elevator buttons. He jumps off of the garbage can into the potted plant, then jumps into the lid which turns rapidly and propels him up and swings him to the elevator buttons.] Get that parkour. Get that parkour! [Pickle Rick kicks the \""down button\"", then waits on the ground for the elevator. The elevator opens, and three men in black suits with earpieces stand inside. They notice Pickle Rick and gasp.]    Pickle Rick:    Hey, it s cool. Just need to find the nearest exit. [The men in the elevator point their guns at Pickle Rick.]    Pickle Rick:    Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out. [One of the men yells something in a foreign language into his earpiece and all three men start shooting at him. He runs away and they chase after him, still shooting at him.]    Pickle Rick:    Whoa! Who in the fuck s toilet is this? [Transition to the frontal exterior of the building. It is a rather large light brown building with a stone fence and a plethora of guards surrounding it. An alarm blares. Some guards run around to the other side of the building s roof. Transition to a surveillance room where the three agents from the elevator are waiting. The [[Agency Director]] slams open the door.]    Agency Director:    What is it?    Agent #1:    A pickle. A rat. Both.    Agent #2:    It says it s a scientist.    Agency Director:    Where is it?    Agent #1:    It seems to be using the air ducts and the mail tubes to get around. [A monitor shows Pickle Rick climbing into an air duct]    Agent #1:     It s been gathering office supplies, we think, to build weaponry. But look what it did on the mezzanine. [The monitor shows Pickle Rick jumping from a potted plant to the trash can to the recycling bin] It transferred a bottle from the trash to the recycling bin. [On the monitor, Pickle Rick picks up a glass bottle from the trash can, taunts the camera with it, throws it in the recycling bin, then runs off.] Whatever this thing is, it s shaming us.    Agency Director:    We have 34 armed guards, and we can t kill a pickle?     Agent #1:    32 armed guards. He killed two.    Agent #2:    It s on the phone. [A phone rings and one of the monitors reads \""INCOMING CALL\"".]    Agency Director:    Put him on, and locate the phone he s using.  [Agent #2 picks up the phone] Hello.    Pickle Rick:    Hi, um, can you, uh (burps) please let me out.    Agency Director:    Your mere presence in this building violates international law. [Agent #1 walks up to the Agency Director with a clipboard, which reads \""LEVEL 3 / ROOM 304\"" in red pen. He taps the clipboard. The Agency Director looks at it and nods.] I couldn t let you out even if you hadn t killed two men. [Transition to Pickle Rick. The bottom part of the phone he is using has been dismantled. He attaches a belt around his waist which has batteries in the back of it.     Pickle Rick:    You should know those men killed themselves.    Agency Director:    And how is that?    Pickle Rick:    They didn t (burps) let me out.    Agent #2:    Solen ya.    Agency Director:    Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!    Pickle Rick:    Uh, is this not a good time or...? [Agent #1 holds his earpiece up to his ear. He gives a thumbs up to the Agency Director. On one of the monitors, six agents run up to the door of room 304 with rifles.]    Agency Director:    Some of my men are calling you \""Solen ya\"": The Pickle Man, an old wives tale. He crawls from bowls of cold soup to steal the dreams of wasteful children. [One of the agents on the monitor gives a thumbs up. The Agency Director pantomimes slicing his neck to Agent #1.]    Pickle Rick:    That d be a lucky break for you.    Agent #1:    Go, shoot to kill! [Transition to room 304. One of the agents slams open the door, knocking over a water jug above the door which activates a pulley which pulls a string which cuts another string which swings a needle towards the agent s head, killing him instantly. Two more agents enter and start to walk in, but fall through the floor onto some spikes, which kill them. The three remaining agents walk in and see this and begin shooting at a pickle which is not Pickle Rick, but a decoy. They continue to shoot at the pickle until it is completely gone.]    Agent #3:    Aaah! We got him. [Transition back to the surveillance room.]    Agency Director:    Ah.    Agent #1:    Ah. [Transition back to room 304. Agent #3 turns a computer around with the tip of his gun, whose screen reads \""Receiving Call / (internet line)\"".]    Pickle Rick:    ...because this pickle doesn t care about your children. And I m not gonna take their dreams. I m gonna take their parents. [Pickle Rick steps on a laptop mouse whose screen reads \""Sending Call\"". The window which reads that is minimized and another window is pulled up which reads \""Sending Explosion / ...\"". Transition to room 304. The computer screen now reads \""Receiving Explosion / (internet line)\"". The laptop blows up and the three agents are sent flying. Pickle Rick jumps out of an air duct into the hallway where the three agents are, holding a device he constructed. He holds up the device and a laser comes out, which burns a hole through all three of the men s heads, killing them instantly. Three more agents come from around the corner. Pickle Rick reloads the device and shoots another laser, this time chopping off the three other agents  ankles with it. He runs away. Transition to the surveillance room. Pickle Rick shows up on each of the monitors, and turns them off as he appears on them.]    Agent #2:    Solen ya! He s coming! It s because I threw half-way my sandwich!    Agency Director:    He s just a pickle!    Agent #2:    He s a monster!    Agency Director:    He s not the only one. [The agency director straightens his tie. Transition to another door. The agency director uses a key card to open the door, which leads to another metal door with two guards standing next to it. He turns the wheel on the door, opening it. [[Jaguar]] sits inside.] You can stay, dead to the world and die in this room. Or you can kill a pickle for me and earn your freedom.    Jaguar:    There is no freedom while your leader breathes. Our country is a prison.    Agency Director:    Then [[Katarina]] is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar.    Jaguar:    Where is this pickle? [Transition to Dr. Wong s office.]    Dr. Wong:    What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?    Beth:    You re the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.    Morty and Summer:    Anti-pickle serum.    Dr. Wong:    Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.    Beth:    My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.  [Morty picks up a book which sits on Dr. Wong s coffee table, which he opens and reads] They re just angry at me for divorcing their father.    Summer:    I never said I was angry at you.    Beth:    That s the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don t have to say \""I m angry at mommy\"" out loud.    Morty:    Oh, my God! [Morty closes the book and puts it back on the coffee table, pointing at it] Oh, there-there s pictures of people eating poop in there! [Dr. Wong picks the book up and puts it on her lap]     Dr. Wong:    It s not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --     Beth:    He won t have to ask for it, okay? He won t need it. He ll just make more. He doesn t need anything from anyone.    Dr. Wong:    You admire him for that.    Beth:    It s better than making your problems other people s problems. [Transition to Pickle Rick and Jaguar fighting in an office. Pickle Rick tries to shoot Jaguar with his laser while Jaguar tries to shoot at Pickle Rick with two guns. A bullet hits Pickle Rick and takes a small chunk out of him.]    Pickle Rick:    Oh, come on! [Pickle Rick hits Jaguar s shoulder with the laser, Pickle Rick hides behind a shelf while Jaguar hides behind a desk]    Jaguar:    Pickle Man, you should know this isn t personal! [Jaguar bites a bullet, and pours the gunpowder into a coffee filter]    Pickle Rick:    You should know that isn t original. [Pickle Rick kicks open a Styrofoam container with a burger inside and pulls it towards him] They have my daughter. [Jaguar takes a water bottle and pours the water into his open wound] There s nothing I won t do to see her again.    Pickle Rick:    Yeah, there s lots I wouldn t do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit. [Pickle Rick takes a tomato slice out of the burger and squeezes it onto his missing chunk. He pulls out a packet of mustard and bites it open. Jaguar pours the gunpowder into his wound and winces. Pickle Rick rubs mustard on his missing chunk and shouts, squeezing open the mustard packet. Jaguar lights a match and puts it up to the wound, setting it on fire. Pickle Rick grabs a stapler and staples a pickle slice to his missing chunk. Both shout in unison]    Jaguar:    I never bullshit, Pickle Man. This can only end with one of us dead, and I have never died.    Pickle Rick:    That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences. [Transition to surveillance room. The two continue fighting. Pickle Rick s laser gradually takes out all of the cameras]    Agency Direcotr:    Is it done? Jaguar?!     Pickle Rick:    Jaguar couldn t make it.    Agency Director:    Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I m unsealing the building.    Pickle Rick:    No, thanks. I m coming for you now.    Agency Director:    Pickle Man, there s $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I ll give you the combination.    Agent #2:    That money belongs to the people.    Agency Director:    Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?!     Pickle Rick:    Take that money, give it to Jaguar s daughter when you set her free. Or I ll be visiting you.    Agency Director:    Jaguar s daughter is dead.    Pickle Rick:    Huh, so you re a liar.    Agency Director:    Jaguar was an animal. You re an intelligent pickle. We can do business.    Pickle Rick:    I don t think so. See you soon.    Agency Director:    Is the helicopter here?    Agent #2:    Yes. And the police are on the way. What do we tell them? [The Director kills both agents with headshots.]     Agency Director:    Tell them we were robbed. [The Director fills a duffel bag with documents and passports and run to the helicopter on the roof, which takes off without him] Hey! Hey, what are you doing?! I m right here! [The shot pans to show the helicopter is being flown by Jaguar, with Pickle Rick in the passenger bay. Pickle Rick takes a drag on a cigarette and throws it into a pile of oil on the roof, igniting it into a half-ring behind the Director. The flames also ignite a fuse leading to a cache of explosives inside the building]     Agency Director:    Farewell, Solen ya.    Jaguar:    F-15s are scrambled. This helicopter will be shot down in seven minutes.    Pickle Rick:    Well, my daughter is about five away, and I ve got about eight to live.    Jaguar:    Pickle Man, it s too late for me to tell my daughter I love her, but not for you.    Pickle Rick:    Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don t really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.    Jaguar:    Okay. Good luck with that. Wait. Do I have infinite daughters?     Pickle Rick:    Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!  [Transition to Dr. Wong s office.]    Beth:    I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.    Dr. Wong:    Good. Summer, you go.    Summer:    I am mad that I can t huff enamel without people assuming it s because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.    Dr. Wong:    Good job. Morty, do you have an \""I\"" statement?    Morty:     I am sad that I peed. I m sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.    Dr. Wong:    Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?  [The door bursts open from Pickle Rick s kick.]    Pickle Rick:    Ugh. [Pickle Rick walks in and flops on the couch next to Summer.]    Dr. Wong:    You must be Rick.    Pickle Rick:    Mm-hmm.    Dr. Wong:    I ve heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You re a lucky fella.    Pickle Rick:    Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don t still happen to have that syringe in your purse?  [Beth looks to Dr. Wong, who nods at her to proceed. Beth looks back at Pickle Rick.]    Beth:    Dad, I would like you to tell me what s in the syringe.    Pickle Rick:    It s a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I ve sustained a lot of damage. I m pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.    Dr. Wong:    By changing you from a pickle to a human.    Pickle Rick:    Yes.    Dr. Wong:    Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?     Pickle Rick:    So I wouldn t have to come here.    Dr. Wong:    Why didn t you want to come here?     Pickle Rick:    Because I don t respect therapy, because I m a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don t like something about the world, I change it. And I don t think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it s helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I m not a cow. I m a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked.    Dr. Wong:    Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it s because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it s your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I m bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it s not an adventure. There s no way to do it so wrong you might die. It s just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die.  Each of us gets to choose. [After a few silent beats, Dr. Wong s watch beeps.] That s our time. I m going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again. And if you have any friends or family that eat poop and would like to stop, give them my number. [Transition to Beth s car. Beth is driving; Pickle Rick is buckled into the front passenger seat; Summer and Morty are in the back bench seat.]    Pickle Rick:    I, um I m sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn t lie to you.    Beth:    Oh, it s fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn t. But I hope you know that s not what that session was supposed to be.    Pickle Rick:    Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever...    Beth:    [Laughs] She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.    Pickle Rick:    Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.    Summer:    Are we gonna go back?     Pickle Rick:    Sweetie, could I ge-get that syringe now?     Beth:    Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it s in my purse. Oh, I m sorry. You must be in agony.    Pickle Rick:    Eh. [Rick injects himself and transforms back into a human, coughing up what looks to be pickle brine.]    Rick:    Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.    Beth:    Weird breed.    Rick:    Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach. [To Beth:] We should get a drink.    Beth:    Really? Like, go somewhere?     Rick:    Yeah, let s drop the kids off and go tie one on.    Beth:    Absolutely!    Morty:    I, I liked her.    Beth:    So what are you thinking, like, Smokey s Tavern? Maybe Shoney s?    Rick:    Yeah, either one. Either one. [Post credits. Transition to Concerto s death trap piano. Rick and Morty are tied up beneath giant piano keys, with other corpses--their heads smashed in--lay to either side of them, while Concerto is perched above them on a smaller piano that controls the death trap.]    Rick:    You ll never get away with this, Concerto.    Concerto:    That is where you re mistaken, Mr. Sanchez. This shall be my greatest performance of all time!  [Concerto starts playing his piano, forcing some of the giant keys to strike the already smashed heads of the corpses.]    Rick:    This is it, Morty. We re goners. We re not getting out of this one. After everything we ve been through, this is how we re gonna die. Make peace with your god.    Morty:    Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don t want to die!     Concerto:    And now for the E-splat!  [Jaguar glides in and slits Concerto s throat.]    Rick:    Jaguar!  [Jaguar looks back to Rick, nods slightly, then extends his flight suit s wings and flies off.]    Morty:    Who? Who was that, Rick?     Rick:    That, Morty, is why you don t go to therapy. </poem>  == Site navigation == {{Transcripts}} [[Category:Season 3 transcripts]]""}]}}}"

A crystal on the shelf starts to glow and Morty points out that it is [[the Vindicators]] calling to help save the universe again for what appears to be the second time. Rick outright refuses to answer an actual [[wikipedia:Hero's_journey#The_Call_to_Adventure|call to adventure]], but ultimately relents because Morty brings up the fact that he gets to pick every tenth adventure. [[file:S3e4 explain worldender.png|thumb|Supernova briefs all on Worldender.]]  Rick and Morty are then seen sitting at a conference table getting briefed by [[Supernova]] on the threat of [[Worldender]]. Rick ends up heckling them at first then introduces every member of the Vindicators there except for [[Vance Maximus]] Renegade Star Soldier, who then shows up and seemingly charms everyone except Rick.   It is then revealed that this is actually the third time the Vindicators had assembled and that they didn't invite Rick and Morty the second time due to a \""personality conflict\"" with Rick and the rest of the Vindicators, which resulted in the deaths of three members of the Vindicators ([[Lady Katana]], [[Calypso]], and [[Diablo Verde]]).  [[file:S3e4 diarrhea everywhere.png|thumb|left|Rick on the conference room table.]]  Rick then gets blackout drunk and we next see him pantsless and having gotten diarrhea all over the conference table the following morning. This mess is left to be cleaned up by [[Noob Noob]] instead of him going on the mission with the rest of the Vindicators. Then, Vance gives Morty a Vindicators vest as to symbolize he is a welcomed member of the Vindicators.  [[file:S3e4 ta da.png|thumb|Rick easily bypasses the machine guns.]]  Inside Worldender's base, the Vindicators get through the traps, then into Worldender's main room. It is then revealed that Worldender is already dying/dead and Rick then tries to leave with Morty. But then, all of the Vindicators are trapped inside of the room, as set up by Rick when he was blackout drunk. It is revealed that \""Drunk Rick\"" set up a Saw-like sequence where the Vindicators are forced to play games to survive or they all die.  [[file:S3e4 triggered.png|thumb|left|Vance, angered about getting Sawed]]  Following a nervous breakdown, Vance then attempts to escape, only to be shot, burned and bisected in the ventilation system in a gruesome death. Morty then solves the puzzle, matching the Vindicators with Rick's opinion of them: Unoriginal.  [[File:S3e4 dorian 5.png|thumb|Crocubot picks out Dorian 5.]] In the next room, Drunk Rick asks the Vindicators to locate a place they would never mention. [[Crocubot]] then goes to the hologram map of the universe to point out [[Dorian 5]]. However, he is wrong and crushed to death. Dorian 5 is revealed to have been a planet destroyed (along with its populace) by the Vindicators to defeat Doom-nometron, a shapeshifter hiding on the planet during the Vindicators 2 mission. Rick stated that if they just brought him along, he could have created a machine to find Doom-nometron in a second. Morty then goes up to the map and locates Israel, the correct answer, as Morty knows that when Rick is blackout drunk, he rants about the United Nations and defense budgets, to which Rick defends isn't because he's anti-semitic.  [[File:S3e4_more_death.png|thumb|left|A domestic argument.]]  In the next room they need to make 5 three-pointers in 5 minutes or else a neutrino bomb will blow up the planet. Morty goes to defuse the bomb, which is revealed to happen a lot more than Rick knew about, while the Vindicators work on scoring three-pointers. During this, Supernova, [[Million Ants]], and [[Alan Rails]] discuss how Supernova and Alan were previously married, and how Supernova cheated on Alan with Million Ants. Alan and Million Ants then begin to fight, Supernova then suspends them in the air and Million Ants kills Alan. Rick makes a smart remark which is the final straw for Supernova who decides to arrest both Rick and Morty.  [[File:S3e4_complaining_about_morty_and_vins.png|thumb|Rick's final monologue.]]  In the final room, Drunk Rick asks for something he believes the Vindicators have that he wants. It is assumed Drunk Rick is talking about Morty because the Vindicators are heroes to Morty-- and Rick isn't. So Morty steps on the platform and he is taken down into a ride in which it seems Drunk Rick is expressing his love for Morty as his grandson. However, it is revealed the ride was intended for Noob Noob, simply because he laughed at Rick's jokes about the Vindicators while Morty was caught up in hero worship.  [[File:S3e4_brutality.png|thumb|left|Supernova betrays [[Million Ants|Snuzzles]]]]  Morty gets back out of the ride (with a look of disgust), and the platform they are on begins to rise. Supernova then goes to kill Rick and Morty for the deaths Drunk Rick caused, to which Million Ants tries to convince Supernova not to do it, only to be killed himself by Supernova.  Before Supernova can do the same to Rick and Morty, the platform reaches a party with music star [[Logic]] singing a rap song about the Vindicators. Supernova gets away, and when Morty points it out, Rick dismissively says that 20 people try to kill him a week, and he ends up getting high with half of them, pointing out that [[Gearhead]] is there. The latter who takes Morty's Vindicators vest when Morty discards it. Beth and Summer are also at the party along with other previously seen characters.   [[File:S3e4_dabbing_im_dying.png|thumb|Logic hits the dab and it's kek, poggers and wholesome 100]]  At that point Logic mentions Noob Noob in the rap song, to which Rick asks \""Who the fuck is Noob Noob?\"", causing Morty to show another unpleasant look.  In the post-credits scene, Gearhead is seen with the Vindicators vest trying to pick up some (possible) college girls, But then when an alien terrorist attack strikes, he goes down an alleyway to ditch the vest and run away, before he trips on a pile of gears and is dismantled.

Morty:    Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They re first line of defense against evil! They re the guardians of the unguarded!    Rick:    They re the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They re a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They re a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.    Morty:    I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten   Rick and Morty   adventures.

Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base.    Rick:    Oh, that s   Million Ants  . I can t see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man.    Morty:    Rick, stop!    Supernova:    Rick, you have something to add to the briefing?    Rick:    Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.   [points to Crocubot]   Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...    [[Crocubot]]:    I am Crocubot.    Rick:      [laughs]   Right, Crocubot.

But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.    [[Alan Rails|Alan]]:    I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.    Rick:    Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents  tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains. It s not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a   whistle!

Morty:    You mean \""two for two\"", right, Vance?   [The Vindicators exchange looks]      Supernova:    Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron.

These guys are even lamer than last time.    Morty:    We weren t here \""last time\"", remember? They did a whole   Vindicators   without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde...    Rick:    Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.   [goes back into the bathroom and continues brushing]      Morty:    This article says the reason we weren t involved was... \""personality conflicts\"".    Rick:    Don t worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it s mind-blowing.    Morty:    I... think the personality conflict might have been...   you  .    Rick:      [spits]   Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they   still   had to bring me back?    Morty:    Rick, since it s my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?     Rick:    Uh, the adventure   is   the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?    Morty:    Rick, this really bums me out. It-It s embarrassing to find out these guys don t like us.    Rick:    Why? Morty,   [burp]   I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.    Morty:    Yeah, but not   heroes  .    Rick:    Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...

Supernova:    Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night. Crocubot, why don t you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can...   [sigh]   clean up his diarrhea.   [Crocubot picks up Rick and carries him out of the room; Noob-Noob walks in carrying firearms and ammunition]      Noob-Noob:    Whoa, I m nervous about my first mission.

Supernova:    Vindicators, prepare for arrival.   [The team disperses while Noob-Noob gets to cleaning; Vance approaches Morty]      Vance:    Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning and I m afraid we need to make a little change.    Morty:      [sigh]   I-I totally get it. I-I m so sorry.    Vance:    You   should   be.   [opens a locker, takes out a blue Vindicator vest and tosses it to Morty]   Running around in a yellow t-shirt like you re not one of us? Disgraceful.     Morty:      [tongue-tied]   I-I-I... I m not a superhero.    Vance:    Cop a squat, chief.   [they sit down]   Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good.    Morty:    Rick says \""good\"" and \""bad\"" are artificial constructs.    Vance:    Yeah, well, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.   [to Noob-Noob]   Not coming, Noob-Noob?    Noob-Noob:      [slips on some diarrhea]   Ohh! No, uh, I... I got stuff to do here. ----   [The ship passes by the planet s surface, and the Vindicators hop out and land safely on the ground at the entrance to Worldender s hideout; Morty is riding on Million Ants, while Crocubot is holding a passed-out Rick; various drones advance toward the team]      Vance:    Security drones, inbound.    Supernova:    Star Mother, grant me your wrath!   [echoes]     [She creates a triangular portal, from which shooting stars emerge and eliminate the drones; the team runs toward the entrance, only to find it has no door]      Alan:    All aboard!   [He blows on his whistle, summoning a ghost train that plows a hole through the mountain and creates an entrance; the team goes inside and finds a wall of dripping lava; Million Ants is able to alter his form to pass through and disable the machine that makes the lava; the team continues moving; Million Ants turns a corner and is hit with bullets from automatic turrets, leaving holes in his form]      Million Ants:    Aah!   [goes back and faces the team]   Gun turret.    Supernova:    Are you all right?    Million Ants:    Yes. I only lost 400 ants. My queen is laying more.   [his holes are now gone]   I am back to one million ants.    Supernova:    Someone wake up Sanchez.   [Crocubot lays Rick down; Vance sprays a puff of blue gas from a finger gun on him, waking him up]      Rick:    Ugh! Oh, Christ...    Supernova:    Rick, you re up.    Rick:    Barely.    Supernova:    Rick, we re taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?    Rick:    Uh-huh.   [Rick takes out a thermos-like container and opens it; he pours some red chemical into a small container, and it generates a small, plump alien creature; he lift sit over his eyeballs and squirts red liquid from it like an dropper, and it pops]       Rick:    Uh, my God, that s better.    Supernova:    RICK!    Rick:    Hey, I can t help if I can t see.   [Rick takes out a small roving device that goes out to face the turrets; the bullets go through a gooey, mercury-like disc at the top of it; the goo is pulled into the device, and out come thin silver discs that morph into small robots, who climb onto the turrets and plug the barrels; Rick jumps out and strikes a \""ta-da\"" pose; the plugged turrets fire until they explode]      Alan:    I could ve just used a ghost train.    Rick:    Really? You don t say. You would have used a ghost train?   [sarcastic]   Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!   [The team begins to press forward]      Alan:    Man, fuck you.    Rick:    Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?    Morty:      [annoyed]   Get it yourself. ----   [The team makes their way through the malls leading to Worldender s lair]      Rick:    Little extra   [burp]   snippy this morning, aren t you?    Morty:    Just focus on the mission, all right?    Rick:      [sarcastic]   Oh, oh, oh, I m sorry. Oh, you re right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?   [makes a gun sign with his hand and moves forward]     [The team enters Worldender s lair and are shocked to find his henchmen massacred]      Alan:      [gasp]   Son of a steam engine! They re all dead!    Crocubot:    Why would Worldender do this to his own men... and several women?    Vance:    Well, he   is   the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing.    Rick:      [still sarcastic]   Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alert over here.   [Rick steps on a part of the floor that triggers the appearance of a hook with a mortally-wounded Worldender hanging from it; his stomach is ripped open with his guts spilling out]      Vance:    What the FUCK?!    Supernova:    It s Worldender! What happened to him?    Worldender:      [weak, pain-filled moan]      Million Ants:    I sense his life force is fading.    Rick:    Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of   two human eyes!     [Worldender coughs up an organ and dies]      Rick:    All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in   Vindicators 4  . Morty?    Morty:    Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can t leave now!    Supernova:    He s right. This is far from over.    Rick:    Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour.   [The windows in the lair fall shut by themselves; the team readies their powers for battle; Rick reaches into his coat for his portal gun; the scene briefly cuts away to his bathroom on the ship, where the portal gun is lying next to a vomit-filled sink]      Rick:    Shit.    Million Ants:    I sense the presence of a greater evil.   [A giant monitor lowers; on the screen is Rick, drunk off his ass, adjusting the camera and stepping back]      Drunk Rick:    Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!   [Everyone turns toward Rick]      Rick:    Welp, it s official. I had too much to drink last night.   [Cut to black; end of Act One]   ----   [Open on the team watching Drunk Rick on the monitor]      Drunk Rick:      [adjusts camera]   If you guys are watching this, you re, you know, the Vindicators. So now that we know...    Vance:      [points his arm cannons at Rick]   Rick? What s going on, buddy?    Rick:    Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.    Supernova:      Obviously?   You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don t remember doing it? That s something   obvious   to you?    Rick:    Look, I m a lit--  [burp]   little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I ve always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.    Drunk Rick:    ...So I thought, why not just do your job for you so we can have a little fun game.   [points to the left]     [The team turns to the left; a spotlight shines on a game show board with crude drawings of the Vindicators with descriptive cards below them, plus a countdown clock timed at 3 minutes above it]      Morty:    Rick, is-is this a \""Saw\"" thing? Are you seriously \""Saw\""-ing the Vindicators?    Rick:    Morty I m a drunk, not a hack.    Drunk Rick:      If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you   will   die. Like in   [burp]   \""Sawwww\"".      Rick:      [embarrassed]   Well, I-I-I think we ve seen enough. I ll just figure out how to unplug this.   [runs somewhere]      Drunk Rick:    Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it s a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or you ll   [burp]   all die.   [Rick returns; the clock begins counting down]      Vance:    Screw this. I m not playing his game. I m gonna find us a way out of here.    Rick:    Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you d die if you tried to leave. That means there s booby traps.    Vance:    Why are you acting like that s not you?!    Rick:    What part of \""blackout\"" don t you understand? I thought you drank?    Vance:    Like   cool   drinking! Like   sexy   drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit!    Morty:    Vance, stay calm...    Vance:    Oh, so   you re   the leader now because we gave you a jacket?! You re the learning-disabled kid we do photo-ops with!    Morty:    Okay,   ouch  , but...    Vance:      [hyperventilating]   Okay, this... this is triggering me. I need space. I-I need SPACE! FROM THIS!   [Vance flies up to the ceiling, tears open a grate and tries to enter the ventilation duct; rapid-fire gunshots, electrical crackles, a chainsaw, and a slicing blade are heard from within as blood and bones fall from above; the team looks on in horror as Vance s lower half falls to the floor; one of his rocket boots suddenly turns on and his remains go flying across the room, splattering blood everywhere, until Crocubot destroys them it with his eye laser; a furious Alan holds Rick up by his throat and raises his fist]      Alan:    Give me one good reason why I shouldn t crush your windpipe!    Rick:    Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.   [an electrical explosion originates from Rick s throat, sending Alan flying back]      Rick:      And   because, like I said, I don t remember last night.    Alan:    I   told you   not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!    Rick:    Alan, I m not proud of what s happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there s gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.    Morty:    Guys!   [finishes placing the cards underneath the pictures]   I ve figured it out.    Drunk Rick:    Congrats! You did it--  [burp]   it!   [The doors to the next room open]      Morty:    It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick s point is that none of you are very special or different.   [despondent]   That s   always   his point.    Supernova:    Let s just get through this as quickly as possible. Then, we ll deal with the two of   you  .   [Everyone starts to walk into the next room]      Morty:    The   two   of us?!   [to Rick]   I hope you re proud of yourself!    Rick:    Uh, I kind of   am  . I saved the goddamn universe.    Morty:    That s not the issue, Rick!    Rick:    Ahh, it would ve been if I hadn t. ----   [The next room, contains a metal platform; another monitors lowers, showing Drunk Rick wearing a deerstalker cap]      Drunk Rick:    The Vindicators say their job is... is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don t... pick the location you ll... you ll never even hear them mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself.   [A holographic map projection of the galaxy appears on the platform]      Crocubot:    Oh, I know this! Dorian 5!   [walks toward the hologram]      Supernova:    Crocubot,   don t!      Crocubot:      [swiping through the map]   There s no other possible answer. My mechanical and reptilian logic are certain of it.   [He picks Dorian 5 on the map and faces the team; the two sides of the platform suddenly clap together and crush him to death, spraying blood and guts on the others]      Rick:    Huh, I m seeing more croc than bot here.    Supernova:      Goddammit!      Morty:    Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?    Supernova:    Nothing!    Alan:    Nothing?!   We exterminated a planet!      Morty:    W-Wait, huh?    Supernova:    Doomnomitron was hiding there! He s a shapeshifter! Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him!    Drunk Rick:    Come on, guys, we re all thinking it. Don t...   [cough]   Don t make me say it.    Morty:      [with annoyed realization]   Oh, o-okay. This again?   [talks toward the hologram]      Rick:    You know,   [burp]   I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like   [snap]   that.    Supernova:    I m not the one that didn t want you back. Alan was!    Alan:      [threateningly]   If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...    Million Ants:      [appears between them]   Do not threaten her!   [A \""ding\"" sound is heard]      Drunk Rick:    Congrats, you did it!   [The doors to the next room open; Morty has chosen Israel on the map]      Supernova:    What the hell is Is-ra-el?    Morty:    I-It s just something Rick starts talking about whenever he s blackout drunk.    Rick:    W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what s my point?    Morty:    In a way that has   no   point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!    Rick:    So, to be clear, I   sometimes   reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.     Million Ants:    I have no stake in this.    Rick:    I don t either. I-I m just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably   so   supportive of Israel, he wants what s best for it and...    Million Ants:    Hey, man, I m not touching this. You do you.   [Everyone walks into the next room]   ----   [Everyone goes into the next room; the doors close behind them; another monitor is there showing Drunk Rick wearing a Hawaiian t-shirt and holding a coconut drink]      Drunk Rick:    Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.   [cough]   I m so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here s the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I m--I m not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let s make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers.   [A light turns on to reveal a basketball hoop, as well as a neutrino bomb and a countdown clock set a five minutes]      Drunk Rick:    let s say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I don t know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii.    Morty:      [sigh]   You guys hit the baskets. I ll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There s a 40% chance it s a dud, but y-you should still stay back.   [starts working on the bomb]      Rick:    Morty, how many of these...?    Morty:      [angrily]   Too many, Rick! Too many!    Rick:    Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.   [walks to join Morty]     [The remaining Vindicators start playing; Million Ants tosses a basketball, and Supernova levitates it over the hoop and drops it; a \""ding\"" is heard and a digital counter on the wall counts up one shot]      Drunk Rick:    That s a three-pointer!    Alan:    Nice shot.    Million Ants:    Thank you.    Alan:    You two make quite a team.   [tosses the ball to Million Ants]      Supernova:    We all do.    Alan:    Yeah, I guess.   [Million Ants and Supernova make another shot; a \""ding\"" is heard and the counter counts up one shot]      Drunk Rick:    That s a three-pointer!    Alan:      [sounding jealous]   But   you   guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.   [He throws the ball into Million Ants  form; he pulls it out of him]      Alan:    I mean,   really   unspoken. Like, \""let s-not-tell-my-husband\"" unspoken.   [Million Ants tosses the ball and misses; a buzzer is heard]      Supernova:      [annoyed]   We aren t married anymore, Alan.    Alan:      [becoming aggressive]   Sure, but   were   we married when you two were \""stranded\"" on Delphi 6 for three days? Because I   sensed   something was weird when you can back. But what do I know about sensitivity? I m just a phantom train conductor. You re the pile of ordinary bugs that   fucked my wife!     [Million Ants makes a shot; a \""ding\"" is heard and the counter counts up one shot]      Drunk Rick:    That s a three-pointer!   [Meanwhile, Rick and Morty are still trying to disable the bomb]      Rick:    Where the fuck is the lead wire?!    Morty:    You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?    Rick:    Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. It s a miracle I actually every destroy anything.    Morty:    Oh, I don t know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...    Rick:    Thank   you.   I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators  dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.    Morty:    Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you re an asshole, it doesn t matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.    Rick:    I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That s why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can eat a double-decker shit sandwich.   [the bomb powers down]   Disarmed.    Morty:      [with realization]   Holy shit. You re jealous.   [Back on the court, the remaining Vindicators are still arguing]      Supernova:    YES! Is   that   what you want to hear?!    Alan:    Did it   feel   good?! Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!   [Million Ants alters his form to make the ball and himself go through the hoop; a \""ding\"" is heard and the counter counts up one shot]      Drunk Rick:    That s a three-pointer!    Morty:    Guys, stop! You re just proving my asshole grandpa right!    Supernova:      [growing sad]   You   wish   this was about sex! We   loved   each other! We had a child together.    Alan:    WHAT?!    Supernova:      [crying]   I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR! And   yes  , he was   better than you!      Alan:      Yeah?      Million Ants:      [morphs into a larger attack form]   One million times better!    Alan:      ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER!!!     [He tries to pull a powerful punch on Million Ants, whose ants disperse to avoid getting hit]    Supernova:    STOP!   [echoes]     [She conjures a purple force field to trap Alan and Million Ants in; Million Ants enters a screaming Alan s mouth, causing his body to expand until he bursts; and blood and guts splatter everywhere and cover Rick and Morty]      Rick:    Oof! Didn t see that comin .    Supernova:    Is that sarcasm?!   [conjures handcuffs onto Rick and Morty]   I don t want you slipping away then this is over!   All   of these deaths are on   your   hands!    Rick:    Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but   definitely   not the train guy.   [Supernova hits Rick in the groin with one of the miniature celestial bodies orbiting her, making him double over in pain]      Supernova:      All of them.      Rick:    O-  kayyy  ...   [Million Ants alters his form to make the ball and himself go through the hoop; a \""ding\"" is heard and the counter counts up one shot]      Drunk Rick:    Congrats, you did it! ----   [The team (or, rather, what s left of it) enters the enxt room; the doors close behind then, inside is a platform and another monitor with Drunk Rick on it]      Drunk Rick:    All right, by now, I ve been pretty clear that I think the Vindicators are   [cough]   full of shit. But... you do have one thing I ll never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. If you know what it is, place it on the platform.  Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode. And probably the solar system,  cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one.     Supernova:    So what s the trick? Morty, you re the Drunk Rick expert.    Morty:    I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. He said it s the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.    Supernova:      Jesus!   Okay, open to second opinions!    Rick:    I could--It could be Morty.     Morty:    What?    Rick:    Hey, I don t know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there s no logic to it. It s, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying \""Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I ll kill you.\""    Million Ants:    That is a... really specific guess.    Rick:    Look, I... there s nothing in the room but us. I m just using logic to connect some dots. It s the best guess I ve got.    Supernova:    But you re betting our lives on it.    Morty:      [smiling smugly, starting walking toward the platform]   I ll cover that bet. I get it.    Rick:    Well, Morty, I think you re making that smirky face because you re misinterpreting the moment. I am   not   being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...   [Morty steps on the platform; a \""ding\"" is heard and everyone else sighs in relief; the platform suddenly opens underneath Morty and a chair pops up for him to sit on; the chair goes down and the platform closes]      Rick:    Oh, shit. ----   [Underneath the platform, the chair powers Morty into a rocket-shaped cart; it starts moving forward like a dark ride at a theme park; he passes through a cardboard cutout environment depicting giant monsters destroying a city]      Drunk Rick:    Sorry, I m... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I m never gonna see you again. I can t really roll with the hero types, and I don t... th-they don t want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn t show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me.   [Some doors open up to reveal the end of the line; a ramp leads to cardboard cutouts haped like a pair of hands with a rainbow painted on them; a monitor appears with Drunk Rick on it]      Drunk Rick:      [getting emotional]   Goddammit, why am I crying? It makes no sense.    Morty:      [he is touched and wipes tears from his eyes]      Drunk Rick:    Ugh, y-you re probably confused because we barely know each other...    Morty:      [his expression becomes puzzled]      Drunk Rick:    ...but you really stuck your neck out   [burp]   when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, \""Oh, the Vindicators are so cool.\"" I mean, he s a moron, it s their... demographic. But you re different, Noob-Noob.    Morty:      [getting angry]     ...Motherfucker!      Drunk Rick:      [crying]   You re fucking cool! And you re smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don t let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later.   [The monitor turns off, the rocket starts going backward]   ----   [Supernova, Million Ants and Rick are standing by the platform when a bitter Morty emerges from it]      Rick:    W--Dude, Morty, what happened i...?    Morty:    Shut up.   [The platform starts to rise]      Million Ants:    I sense this means we are not dying.    Supernova:    Not   all   of us.   [She starts to Force-choke Rick and Morty]      Million Ants:    Sweetheart?    Supernova:    Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles. It s for the greater good.    Morty:      [gagging]   Greater good?!    Rick:      [also gagging]   Titty-Bean?    Supernova:    It s like you said, Morty:   there s no right or wrong  .    Morty:    Never said that!    Supernova:    It s the galaxy s   faith   in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure!    Rick:      [sarcastic]   Yeah, I feel safer already.    Morty:    No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?    Rick:    I ll say, we are gettin  some good licks in while choking to death.    Morty:    Right?    Million Ants:    Titty-Bean, listen to me. When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants. It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice, that taught me to be a man.   [Supernova stops strangling Rick and Morty; they drop to the floor]      Supernova:    When did it get so complicated?    Million Ants:    Who knows? But we can make it simple again.    Supernova:    You were always the romantic.   [sinister]   Which is why you can t leave either.   [She reaches into Million Ants  chest and removes the queen ant]      Supernova:    Goodbye, my love.   [She squishes the queen, causing Million Ants to fall apart and become a non-sentient pile of ants]      Rick:      Damn!   She double-crossed Snuzzles!   [Supernova looms over Rick and Morty and prepares to deal a fatal blow]      Supernova:      Silence!   I m going to enjoy this...   [She is interrupted by the sound of an air horn]   ----   [The platform reaches the top and the three suddenly find themselves at a party]      Announcer:    Let s give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out there:   Logic!      [[Logic]]:      [offscreen]   Aww, yeah!   [starts rapping]      Rick:    Look at that. Geez, I must ve planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.   [Logic appears on the stage]       Logic:    Are you ready?   There s a choo-choo train man, he s rolling down tragedy     Everybody knowing Supernova fights gravity      [Morty notices Supernova making her way through crowds, pretending to dance with them]      Morty:    Rick, Supernova s getting away!    Rick:    Ah, who cares?    Morty:    But.. she was trying to kill us!    Rick:    Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of  em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head s here.   [Gear Head is sampling food at a table; in the background, some teenagers are taking photos with Worldender s corpse]      [[Gear Head]]:    Hmm. Well, that s gonna shoot through me.    [[Beth Smith|Beth]]:      [walks out from the crowd]   Morty, you re wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now?    Morty:    Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don t need jackets.   [takes his jacket off]   And I m pretty sure we don t need Vindicators.    Gear Head:      [takes the jacket]   Don t mind if I do.   [walks offscreen]   Hey, everybody! Look who s a Vindicator!    [[Summer Smith|Summer]]:      [walks out from the crowd, carrying her phone]   Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten   shitfaced  .    Rick:    Shut up, Summer.     Logic:      Can t forget about the one who never seems to get a chance      Crowd:      Noob-Noob!      Logic:      All the bitches come around for...      Crowd:      Noob-Noob!      Logic:      His dick gets more visits than...      Crowd:      YouTube!       Rick:    Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?   [Morty turns to Rick with an exasperated expression; cut to credits; Logic s rap continues until the end]   ----   [On Gear World, Gear Head, wearing Morty s Vindicator jacket, is hanging out with two Gear girls by a gear cream stand]      Gear Girl #1:    I can t believe we re getting gear cream with a Vindicator.    Gear Head:    So, you girls in Gear college or Gear...   [An explosion occurs offscreen; a frightened citizen runs by]      Gear Citizen:    Alien terror attack!    Gear Head:      [starts to slowly back into an alley]   Okay, sounds like a job for...   me  . I better go get into my alter ego.    Gear Girl #1:      [gasp]   So cool!    Gear Girl #2:    I know.    Gear Girl #1:    Wait,   what   alter ego? He was already wearing the jacket.   [They look into the alley and see that Gear Head had throws away the jacket and is beating a hasty retreat]      Gear Head:    Gotta know when to hold  em and...

Jerry, come on!  We got to go!  You got to come with me, Jerry!  Rick?  It s important, Jerry.  ( Burps ) The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders.  Let s go.  Put some pants on.  N-Never mind, there s no time for pants, Jerry.  I ll make you a pair of pants on the way.  It s a Rick and Jerry adventure!  Rick and Jerry episode!   266a 266a  266a 266a  266a 266a  Then I thought, \""Hey, what about Jerry?  He s -- He s good with regular folk.\""  This is a real situation where -- where -- where Jerry could really shine.  He s a master convincer.\""  Rick, I m not an idiot.  I know what this is.  Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty, \""Look, parents get divorced.  They get sad. He ll be fine,\"" but I think he s worried you re gonna, you know...Pbht!  And you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional.  It impedes my work.  So, I told him I d take you out and give you a win.  Wait. My son asked you to take me on some kind of pity adventure to keep me from killing myself?  Wait, w-what did you think it was?  An execution.  Geez!  You really do need a win.  No!  I-I don t know.  I mean, you never made me the pants, so --  So, you thought I was gonna drive you into the middle of the galaxy and shove you into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out?  And we re seeing how you d act if that were about to happen?  I mean, shit, I ll make you the pants right now.  Take me two seconds to make you pants.  I have pants at home!  Jerry, if I make pants, they ll be better than your pants at home.  Also, if I wanted to kill you --  Yeah, I get it.  It would be amazing.  Please, take me home.  I ll tell my son we had an amazing adventure.  Well, if it s all the same, could we go get our story straight?  Because you re a terrible liar.  You called me a master convincer!  You believed me?  Huh. This seems... kind of fancy.  Jerry, for all you know, this is the equivalent of an alien truck stop.  You have no frame of reference.  You re in a universe beyond your imagining.  But, yes, it is super fancy.  I mean, my job here is to make Morty happy.  I m not gonna take you somewhere dangerous.  ( Grunts )  Rick Sanchez.  I told you if I ever saw your face in here again, I would stick you like the pig you are.  ( Coughs ) Shnoopy Bloopers, I told you if you tried...  There d be two funerals.  Aaah!!  Someone?  Uh, someone?  Someone!  ( Both grunt )  ( Both laughing )  My friend!  It has been too long.  Oh, it s great to see you again, buddy!  ( Both laughing )  Yeah, you re doing it.  Mr. Sanchez gets anything he wants!  The resort s covered in an immortality field.  You can t die here.  That s the gimmick.  ( Kids laughing )  Okay, but still -- bad parenting.  Hey, rich a-holes are rich a-holes.  They all pay top dollar to come here and enjoy a consequence-free vacation.  No death, no disease, no dismemberment.  ( Grunting )  Can t even have a heart attack.  Got it.  The perfect place to take the most fragile being in the universe.  I can tell you expect me to refute that, but it s right on the money.  If I come home without you, I doubt Morty s gonna let me off the hook.  Yeah, but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum?  What the f*ck are you talking about, Jerry?  ( Spits ) Jesus!  Holy f*cking shit!  Yo, what s up, \""Big Chill\""?!  Don t go into the telepod!  ( Both laughing )  Hey, maybe we would have fun on a fake adventure.  On a fake adventure.  Speaking of --  What are we gonna tell Morty?  I don t know.  But whatever it is, we re gonna need a couple more of these babies!  ( Clink! )  ( Sobbing )  What s wrong?  ( Crying ) Mom, do you think I m hot?  I...don t think that s something that matters.  So, I m not hot?!  I m saying the part of you that cares about that is a part you shouldn t give any energy to.  That s not an answer!  Because I m not an issue of Cosmo, okay?  I m your mother and a doctor, and --  I m hideous!  ( Sobbing )  Geez.  What s with her?  Teenage-girl stuff.  Is that a... hoof collage?  It s perfectly legal, if that s what you re wondering.  Cool...zies.  \""We just don t have anything in common any more, Summer.\""  Oh, yeah, Ethan?  What do you have in common with Tricia Lange?  A mutual love of French cinema?  The belief that a carbon tax is the only viable solution to climate change?  Or could it be her massive stripper titties?!  ( Gasps )  There it is.  Boob-ya!  And that s when Malakai the Squid came, rips off his face, and beneath it is my face.  I liked it.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, of course he likes it.  Look at him.  m*therf*cker got two heads and three trunks.  All right, we ll put a pin in it.  I m gonna go take a leak.  ( Whistling )  What the...?!  ( Grunting )  ( Gasps )  My hands are dry!  My hands are dry!   266a 266a  My name is Risotto Groupon.  I am the assistant general manager of the restaurant.  Do you have any comment cards, because I might have some thoughts.  My kingdom was usurped by force with weapons and technology supplied by your father-in-law!  Hey, he usurped my kingdom, too, man.  He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family.  Then we are brothers, and you have wondered what your life could have been without Rick.  Wondered? Sure.  I mean, I ve wondered about having a v*g1n*.  Would you help me kill him?  What? No!  He s my wife s father.  Move on.  Do you... like theme-park rides?  Oh, you really moved on.  There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Dirly.  Between the first whirly and the third dirly, the ride dips just outside the immortality field.  You re asking me to lure Rick to his death?  I m only asking you to go on a ride with Rick, get off the ride without Rick, and go home to your family, where you can... wonder about having a v*g1n*.  Okay, okay, that was a very specific example pulled from thin air.  I don t want to be known as the v*g1n* guy.  Risotto, you re needed.  Someone ordered the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh and Fluzzy Special.  ( Sighs dejectedly )  Look, I m not like Rick, so you re free to do as you please.  But there comes a time in every man s life when he must choose the foundation on which his legacy will be built -- one of compromise or one of blood.  ( Kids cheering )  * Once a time of year, there s a special person here *  ( Whirring )  Oh, yeah.  That s what I m talking about.  Oops! Okay, a little more on the other side then.  Oh, come on!  ( Gasps )  Oh, geez!  Aah! Stop!  So, the hospital just let you walk right out of there with horse parts in a bag?  For Christ s sakes, Morty, women going through a divorce need a creative outlet.  ( Crash )  What was that?  ( Deep voice groaning )  Summer!  ( Grunting )  I m coming, Summer!  What the hell happened?!  ( Deep voice shouts indistinctly )  How do we get her back to normal?!  I don t know, man! This thing is pretty complicated.  I-I m gonna call Rick.  Well, hold on.  We can t just call your grandpa whenever there s a problem.  We can handle this ourselves.  I mean, I don t see the point in trying to.  This is obviously Rick-level sh1t.  I have a medical degree.  Is that what this is about?  L-Like, you want to prove yourself?  Oh, it s not about anything, Morty. How dare you?  Okay, good.  Then I ll just call -- Ow!  Morty, I need this.  ( Laughing )  Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here says he knows a place where the ladies drop panties for anyone bi-pedal.  Yeah, I m not really interested.  My heart still belongs to Beth.  Oh. Huh. Okay.  ( Slurps )  What, you don t think I have a shot?  I didn t say that.  Excuse me.  May I have another one of these?  Coming right up.  Hmm, things weren t always so bad between Beth and me.  We had some good times when we were younger.  Oh, yeah, I bet.  That s how teenage pregnancy happens, my friend.  Yeah, no.  ( Chuckles )  Things were pretty great, even until a couple of years ago.  Jerry, I get it.  That s around the time I moved in with you guys.  Oh, I guess you re right.  Jerry, you know, I hope you re not suggesting that I had anything to do with your marriage breaking up, because there are some major issues between you and Beth that have been there since you guys met.   266a 266a  Hey, to new beginnings.  To the Whirly Dirly.  The Whirly Dirly?  All right, what s going on here?  When did you get cool?!  ( Laughs )  When you stole my wife!  I should have done that a long time ago!  We re going on the Whirly Dirly!  Whirly Dirly, baby.  ( Clink )  ( Rumbling )  Aha, look at this.  It says \""normalize.\""  I bet if we just press that --  But...if the machine was made by spider people, normal would mean eight legs.  Oh, God! are you gonna go on another spiel like you did with the flesh-colored crayon?  I m pretty sure \""normalize\"" will make her normal.  ( Whirring )  ( Deep voice ) Aah!  I d call that progress.  She s huge!  And normal!  I m not normal!  Mom!  Okay, this says \""reverse.\""  Done and done.  I don t think that s a good idea.  Oh, come on! What else could \""reverse\"" possibly mean?  ( Whirring )  Aah!  Mom, call Rick!  Thank you.  There s a customer-service number on here.  Mom!  ( Dialing )  ( Screaming )  Oh, man.  This is gonna be awesome!  I got to hand it to you, Jerry.  This was a solid idea.  Uh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  And you know what?  I ll cop to it.  I put a lot of strain on your marriage.  It wasn t fair.  I m sorry.  What?!  I didn t respect your marriage.  I certainly didn t do it any favors.  And for what it s worth, I ll apologize to Beth for it when we get home.  Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!  Stop the ride!  We got to get off.  What are you talking about, buddy?  We got to get out of this thing.  We got to get out!  ( Grunts )  Jerry, come on, man!  We haven t even gotten to the first whirly.  No, no, this sucks.  It s so boring.  I mean, I m falling asleep here.  Let s just get out and crawl down the sides.  ( Both screaming )  Uh, get down!  Duck down!  It s more fun when you scrunch down.  Jerry, what the --  Oh sh1t!  ( Grunting )  ( Screaming )  Rick, up here! There s a spot where you can kill him!  Good call, Jerry!  Hey, how d you know about that?  Uh...  ( Both screaming )  ( Both laughing )  Lisa?  ( Both screaming )  So, uh, Jerry, big fan of the Whirly Dirly, are you?  Not anymore. ( Chuckles )  Obviously.  But when you were, how did you know about it?  ( Grunting )  We had a deal, Jerry Smith.  It s a really common name.  Now, take it easy, Rick.  You ve been in a serious roller-coaster crash.  It s -- It s no time to be thinking about who did or didn t play a role in your attempted murder.  ( Screams )  Get it off me!  It s eating me!  Look, I confess, okay?  They told me about all the bad stuff you did to this planet and reminded me of all the bad stuff you did to me.  But then you said you were sorry, and I realized you re not a monster -- not like this thing.  f*ck It s got me good.  This is a mislead, right?  You re inventing a thing to save me.  That would be called a knife, Jerry.  It s been invented.  I m making a way out of here --  One seat ought to do it.  I m sorry.  I-I made a mistake.  I won t do it again!  Nobody ever does.  ( Grunting )  You self-righteous piece of sh1t You took my family!  I took your family?  Who do you think had more taken from them when you shot 20 ccs of liquid dream-killer into my daughter?  She was Rick s daughter, Jerry.  She had options!  Oof.  That all ended because she felt sorry for you.  You act like prey, but you re a predator!  You use pity to lure in your victims!  That s how you survive!  I survive because I know everything.  That snakes survives because children wander off, and you survive because people think, \""Oh, this poor piece of sh1t.  He never gets a break.  I can t stand the deafening silent wails of his wilting soul.  I guess I ll hire him or marry him.\""  Rick!  ( Muffled ) Rick!  I knew you wouldn t let me die.  That was never an option.  Because you never had a son.  No, because I need a living organism coated in gibble snake bile to attract a shmooglite runner.  Wait, what s happening?  Use that confusion, Jerry.  It ll make you wriggle more like an abandoned newborn.  ( Low growling )  Jesus Christ!  What the f*ck Rick?!  Help!  Help me!  ( Roaring )  Aaah!  There s a space port 20 miles south.  We ll be able to board a galaxy class cruise ship and jump through a wormhole that will put us within spitting distance of the Milky Way.  But, hey, it s about the journey, not the destination, right, Jerry?  ( Roars )  ( Moaning )  Just stay put, sweetie!  Mom s still on hold.  Morphizer customer service.  How may I help you?  Yes, I m having a little trouble with one of your machines.  Oh, I m sorry to hear that, ma am.  Do you see a little compartment on the side of the machine?  Let me check.  Yes, got it.  Mom?  Great! Now, do you see the little button next to it?  I do.  Give that button a push.  Okay.  Mom, listen to me!  We re free!!  Okay, so I pushed the button, and three little men ran out.  What do I do next?  Hello?  I think we got disconnected.  Morty!  Don t \""Morty\"" me!  I tricked Rick into taking Dad on an adventure because I thought I could get a break from this kind of sh1t but no!  Like father, like Goddamn daughter!  You want to be like Rick, congratulations!  You re just as arrogant and just as irresponsible!  Everything okay here?  Mind your own Goddamn business, Gene!  I m having a conversation with my mother here!  Kissing Rick s ass isn t gonna help him keep him around, Mom, but it will help you lose everyone else.  Like I lost Summer.  Hey, you haven t lost her yet.  No, I definitely did.  She s gone.  God damn it!  ( Beeping )  Go ahead.  ( Alarm blares )  Oh, come on.  What s happening?  Your friend is class C or above cybernetic augmentations.  Emphasis on the above.  In any case, he needs to be neutralized.  What?! Wait!  Ugh!  ( Groans )  Brain hurty.  What did you do?  It s a synaptic dampener that blocks violent tendencies and controversial thought.  He will now be an ideal passenger.  I want cookies and a 90-minute cut of \""Avatar.\""  Seriously?  ( Snapping )  Quit it.  It ll wear off in six hours.  It s cheaper than banning dangerous people from flights.  I mean, let everybody buy a ticket, right?  Otherwise, the terrorists win.   266a 266a  Aah!  I m sorry I m not a classic maternal archetype.  Okay, I don t know what to do when you people come to me with your weird puberty issues.  What are you gonna do when your daughter asks you if she s attractive?  I ll say \""yes\""!  Morty, gross!  Well, she s gonna be super hot.  Her mother s gonna be Jessica --  Wait, when did Summer ask you that?!  Right before she Clive Barkered herself. Why?  Wait, I know where she is!  Ethan and Summer were supposed to go camping, and then he dumped Summer for this girl, Tricia Lange, who s got huge boobies and took her.  Campsite -- The one with the name that sounds like somebody gave up halfway through naming it.  Uh...Camp Flabanabba!  Mama s coming, baby.  Mama s coming, and she cares about your titties!  They have sweet smiggle honey cookies.  Mmm! And low-calorie petroleum flakes.  Obviously cookies.  Let s get you the flakes then.  Okay, but it s not what I wanted.  Well, maybe next time, you won t be such a dumb piece of sh1t and you can pick for yourself.  That s not nice.  What s that?  Did you just have a controversial thought?  No.  That s what I thought, bitch.  You little punk-ass.  ( Chuckles )  This is the best.  I agree.  You ve made things even easier than if you hadn t been incompetent.  Uh-oh.  We get shoot-shoot now.   266a 266a  Man #1: All right, folks, if you could please take your seats, we re about to enter the wormhole.  So, I hope everybody bought it dinner first.  ( Chuckles )  Nice.  Nice.  ( Grunts )  Jerry, step over there and lock yourself in the escape pod.  You re not killing us?  I m killing Rick.  You re free to go. You re no threat to me or anyone.  Now you re just being mean.  Yeah, you re mean --  No offense.  Mean would be shooting you, Jerry.  This is saving a bullet.  Go back to your quietly ashamed family and live out the rest of your days in denial of your v*g1n* fantasies.  It was a one-time thought that everyone has!  ( Grunting )  What are you doing?  I m being triumphantly brave!  It s not triumphant or brave.  You re not risking anything.  You might shoot me.  I think you know I won t.  Because you know I feel sorry for you.  You re just doing this so you can tell yourself you fought -- Ow!  ( Buzzing )  Woman: Temporal shield compromised.  Congratulations, Jerry.  You get to die a man.  Uh, that s okay!  I ll leave!  Please don t shoot.  I-I m the v*g1n* guy, remember?   266a 266a  Whoa!  What is happening to me?  Where is this?  Where am I?  Am I dead?  A-Am I -- Am I still alive?  Rick: Those aren t the questions you should be asking.  Huh?!  Shh!  ( Cawing )  ( Burping )  ( Ticking )  ( Roar )  ( Chuckles )  Ah, got ya!  Come here, you little pumpkin.  I have sh1t on my ass.  Whoa, oof this!  Who am I?  Who am I?  I m time!  I m literally time!  All: Whooooa!  Aah!  Oh, God. I feel like our souls were united, and we were all one with eternity.  Our body s unchanged, yet our minds have lived a thousand lifetimes.  Is that enough time for me to forgive you?  I don t know, but it s enough time for a synaptic dampener to wear off.  ( Pop )  He hadn t decided he was still going to kill us!  He was talking himself into it.  I ve seen it before.  Cosmic apotheosis wears off faster than salvia.  I m starting to believe you because I just finished merging with your essence for an endless epoch, and I m already back to thinking you re an asshole.  Fine with me.  Let s just go our separate ways.  Sounds like you and the word \""epoch\"" have a lot of catching up to do.  Wait, don t leave me!  Man #1: All right, folks, you re free to get up and walk around the cabin and maybe take the wormhole out for breakfast.  Man #2: Okay, you can do the dinner one or the breakfast one, but not both.  You think you got that thing figured out?  Yeah, I know what I m doing.  Good.  Because I have an idea.  It s actually a contraction of \""some\"" and \""more,\"" you see that?  Oh, wow.  I was way off.  ( Roaring )  ( Both screaming )  ( Groaning indistinctly )  ( Both groaning indistinctly )  Morty, what s happening here?  Summer got into my grandpa s garage, messed around, and turned herself into a monster.  My mom did the same to make her feel better.  She s a good mom.  ( Both chuckle )  Oh, my God.  I have to go call my mother!  Tricia, wait!  Ethan! Ethan!  Hey, it s okay.  Sit down.  You made my sister cry, Ethan.  You messed with her body image.  Look, Morty, I --  Shh, shh, shh.  Careful, Ethan.  Your s more is burning.  ( Beep, whirring )  ( Gulps )  Uh, I guess we better get on the same page about our fake adventure.  Right.  I ll make you a deal.  I ll leave out the part where you tried to murder me...  And I ll leave out the part where you admitted to sabotaging our marriage.  You want to...?  Nah, if the family sees me like this, they ll feel sorry for me.  Which is no longer my signature move.  Later days, amigo.  Actually, I just realized, I don t have my wallet, and my bus pass is in there, so maybe --  Stay strong, Jerry.  I believe in you!  ( Lock clicks )  ( Whirring )  ( Sighs )   266a 266a  266a 266a  266a 266a  266a 266a  I tell you, fellas.  This is the life.  It certainly is.  To freedom!  ( Groaning )  Ooh!  Looks like a 4-22.  Ooh, a couple cranks on scaling knob with a four dilabyte cross fade would fix that in a jiff.  Four? You d be lucky to clear 13% de-morphized with that kind of range.  Gentlemen, gentlemen, what did we agree on?  Together: No work talk!  Let s just relax and enjoy our retirement, shall --  ( Bird screeches )  Oh, my God!

The moment is interrupted by Rick, who asks Morty to go with him on what he promises to be a quick twenty-minute adventure for a crystal. Said adventure goes on for six days and, despite being heroes and Rick getting the crystal, both Morty ''and'' Rick finally break down. Over-stressed from non-stop adventures, Rick finally decides it's time for a vacation.  While relaxing at an alien spa, they decide to try out a machine that supposedly removes all the toxicity of its users. Upon use, Rick and Morty find themselves in a toxic wasteland full of disgusting creatures, at first believing the machine blew up the rest of the spa, only for Rick to discover that they aren't the real Rick and Morty: they are ''literally'' the toxicity of themselves, Toxic Rick as the rude, lying, alcoholic, genius asshole part of himself and Toxic Morty being the nervous, pathetic, and self-loathing part of himself. While the real Rick and Morty leave the spa refreshed after their vacation\u2013Rick also has a normal skin color instead of his ''gray-alcoholic'' skin color\u2013Toxic Rick begins plotting a way to get out.  Morty, freed from all his insecurities, suddenly becomes popular and confident in school, helping the self-esteem of almost all of the students and impressing Mr. Goldenfold by openly insulting him in class. He even works up the courage to ask Jessica out, which she happily accepts. However, Rick reveals to Morty he started receiving strange signals on his phone that he traced back to the spa and upon further investigation discovered what actually happened to their removed toxicity. Though Morty tells him to ignore it, Rick feels obligated to re-merge with his toxicity as he removed the part of himself that would not care, thus he does care that they accidentally created life.  Morty's date with Jessica does not go well, as Jessica is thrown off by Morty's complete openness and seeming inability to stop talking. Morty is fine with it and convinces another girl named Stacy to come home with him. Upon arriving, he learns Rick purchased the machine from the spa and in cooperation with Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty rigged it so they could re-merge with their toxic selves. Morty refuses, claiming that Toxic Rick could be lying, so Rick tries to force him into the machine. However, just as the machine is activated, Morty says an agreed upon \""safe word\"" (Sea Cucumber) and Stacy pulls the two out and takes their place, teleporting her into the tank and replacing her with Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty, who revel in having tricked their real selves until they realize they are all in the same room.  Toxic Rick at first continues to try to get Rick into the toxic tank, but eventually resolves to make the whole world toxic instead, using a Moon Tower to transmit the toxicity around the planet. At first Rick refuses to stop them, saying it's not his place to decide which dimensions are saved or destroyed, but upon getting slapped by Morty, he realizes that the detox machine removes toxicity in a user based on that person's definition of toxicity. Toxic Rick manages to turn the world toxic, driving it to total depravity and violence, just as Rick and Morty arrive. Rick realized that his normal self considered his irrational attachments to people toxic, thus he knows Toxic Rick cares too much about Morty to allow him to die: with this knowledge, he shoots Toxic Morty with a nanobotic virus that will destroy him in twenty minutes, cutting that time in half with each progressive shot until an agonized Toxic Rick finally agrees to re-merge with him. Restored to his former self, Rick turns off the toxicity beam and restores the world, but Morty flies away with a jetpack to avoid having to re-merge with his toxic self. Rick is left shocked that he didn't expect this.  Three weeks later, Morty has become a ''Wolf of Wall Street''-esque salesman in New York and living an altogether healthy lifestyle with his attractive girlfriend Jacqueline. While at his apartment he receives a call from Jessica begging him to come back, which he knows is part of Rick's plan to trace his location. However, he does not manage to hang up in time, and Rick and Jessica track him down. Using a group of drones to tie Morty down, Rick forcibly re-inserts the boy's toxicity, turning him back into his miserable self. While Rick and Jessica argue over who actually wanted regular Morty back, Morty amicably breaks up with Jacqueline. He offers her the apartment and the drones. However, Rick refuses to give up the latter because he loves their ability to form a Voltron-like combination.  Mirroring the opening scene, Morty listens to Jessica talking about going out with Brad again, which she insists was not a date but her friends claim is proof they are back together. Just as Rick drags Morty into another adventure, Jessica stops him and lets him know she's glad to have him back.  In the after-credits scene, a tour visits the Moon Tower and discovers the tank. Upon turning it on, Stacy is teleported back into the real world, screaming the safe word from earlier in the episode.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Holly: Who are you gonna date; now that you can date anyone?  Jessica: I don 2019t know. I mean, obviously if someone special comes along. B-But I mean really special, like, nothing I 2019ve even remotely considered in the past.  Morty: (muttering while fixing his hair) Holyshitholyshitholyshit.  Tricia: I want that kind of love like that docking kind of love.  Holly: Oh, yeah.  Tricia: Like, penis in the foreskin kind of love Mm-hmm just, like, warm, just like...  [girls notice Morty]  Morty: Hey... (Cough) ah...  Rick: Everybody, fuck off. Morty, I need your help. W-W-W-We We need to go on a quick adventure.  Morty: You said I could go to school today.  Rick: That was before I needed something, Morty. There 2019s a plasma shard in the Abadango Cluster. A princess has it. If I get it, I 2019ll be awesome.  Morty: We 2019ve been going non-stop, Rick. It 2019s not healthy. You know, these are my teenage years. I-I just found out Jessica 2019s single.  Rick: Oh, that 2019s Wow, Morty. Wow. What an exciting life you lead. (shoots portal) Let 2019s go. In and out, 20 minutes adventure.  [Timecard: six days later. Cut to Rick and Morty inside a space cruiser in unkempt and fatigued condition with Morty in the wheel and Rick holding wires]  Morty: They 2019re on our tail!  Rick: Steady, Morty. Five cetons.  [The two enters a mothership, while Rick pulls a wire and the ship slows down]  Steady, God damn it! Two cetons.  [Rick inserts an isotope in a box and places it on the dashboard and connects it with plugs]  Morty: Wha!  Rick: Fire!  [Morty pulls the trigger and shoots a laser, causing an explosion. The cruiser quickly gains speed]  Rick: Pull up, Morty, pull up! Pull up!  [The explosion causes a chain of explosions that eventually destroys the whole structure, while the two screams all the way and barely escapes the huge blast. Cut to the two on stage in an award ceremony. Cut to the two in the vehicle garage and gets in their vehicle. Some bottles can be heard dropping.]  [Morty buckles up]  Rick and Morty: (sigh)  Rick: (continues sighing) Fuck.  Morty: (crying)  Rick: (screams) Oh, fuck! Fuck! Ahh! Ahh!  Morty: I can 2019t fucking do this anymore!  Rick: That was seriously fucked up. We almost died.  Morty: So you agree?  Rick: Fuck yes! That w... T-This was insane! That was pure luck. I was not in control of that situation at all.  Morty: (continues crying)  Rick: (notices his hands shaking) Look at this, Morty. Look at my fucking hand. Look at this shit.  Morty: Why do you... Keep doing this to us?!  Rick: I don 2019t know, Morty. Maybe I hate myself, maybe I think I deserve to die. I-I-I-I don 2019t I don 2019t know!  Morty: (cries again)  Rick: We need a vacation.  (intro plays)  (Screen shows an alien spa. Aliens are seen relaxing and walking around. An alien worker is seen pressing a button which makes a big pink creature spit out relaxed Rick and Morty onto a comfy mattress.)  Rick: Isn 2019t that something?  Morty: You were right. Best day spa in the galaxy.   Rick: It s not even cruel, either. These things are just doing what they do in the wild. It loves swallowing stressed-out creatures for 20 minutes and then puking them up.  Morty: My whole body 2019s like a baby 2019s ass.  (Scene cuts to Rick and Morty walking down a hallway with different rooms in it while holding drinks.)  Alien: Complimentary psychological detox? Removes all your cognitive toxins, (clears throat) purifies your system.   Rick: Oof, this guy on commission or something?  Morty: I don 2019t think. Are you on commission?  Alien: We 2019re not on (gurgle) commission. We get (gurgle) paid by the hour. There 2019s no incentive really-  Rick: (Annoyed) Oh, my god. Okay, listen. W-W-W-We 2019ll try the machine, but but I 2019d like you to try something. Try swallowing the giant ball of snot that 2019s dangling around in the back of your throat. (Throws drink on the ground while getting in the aliens face) It 2019s disgusting. Nobody wants to hear that. Ahem. Ahem! That 2019s what you do.   Morty: (Grabs Rick by the arm and drags him into the room): Okay, Rick, come on. Enough.   (Rick and Morty both sit on the seats as the doors close)  Rick: Wow, did you hear me bite that guy s head off? Geez, I really need to chill.   Morty: Maybe you should go through twice.   Rick: All right, mister comedy man, you don 2019t have to bust my balls. You 2019re not helping things.  (The machine starts to shake and make loud noises. Rick and Morty look around, Concerned.)  Morty: Rick, is this thing supposed to be making this no-  (The room explodes with a bright flash of white.)  (The white fades with a ringing noise for a few seconds, showing Rick laying down in a gross mucky surface of mud like stuff. He is made out of the same gunk. Rick lifts his face out of the muck and looks around, squinting. His whole surrounding is mucky, dark and gross.)   Toxic Rick: (He stands up and shouts out for Morty.) Morty!  Toxic Morty: (Toxic Morty is seen almost completely sunk inside the mud.) (Waves his hand weakly to get Rick s attention.) R-Rick.  Toxic Rick: Morty! (He walks up to Toxic Morty and forcefully grabs him and yanks Morty out and back onto his feet.)  Toxic Morty: Ugh! What Happened?  Toxic Rick (Yelling at scared Toxic Morty): We blew up, idiot! Are you really that stupid? Obviously the guy I yelled at overloaded the machine. It takes more than that to kill Rick and Morty, motherfucker!   (A group of angry, groaning  00a0and mucky creatures crawl towards Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty.)   Toxic Rick: But this might do it. Run, Morty!   (Toxic Rick grabs Toxic Morty s arm and run away from the creatures.)  Toxic Morty: E-Everything hurts!   Toxic Rick: That 2019s because you 2019re worthless! (He steps on a creature 2019s face that 2019s in the muck, killing it.) Jesus, how big was this explosion? I 2019m a genius. I don 2019t have time for this shit.  (They both run into a messy and mucky cave. Toxic Rick throws Toxic Morty into it.)   Toxic Morty: (Scared, in the fetal position) W-W-We 2019re in Hell, aren 2019t we, Rick?   Toxic Rick: (Points at Toxic Morty, yelling at him.) You 2019re so stupid, Morty. You 2019re an (Belches) idiot. There 2019s no such thing as Hell.   Toxic Morty: I believe you, but I just want to die.   Toxic Rick: You can die when I say so. I control you. I control the universe! Why am I bragging about that? I have nothing to prove. I 2019m surrounded by inferior pieces of shit and  2013   (He stops her sentence and notices something. He stares at scared Toxic Morty as a piece of his cheek melts off.)  Toxic Rick: Toxins. We 2019re not in Hell, Morty. (Looks around) We 2019re in the detoxifier. The machine didn 2019t blow up. It worked normally. (Wipes goo off of his arm) It removed our toxins. (He grabs Toxic Morty s face.) We 2019re the toxins.   Toxic Morty: (Starts screaming in terror) Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!  Toxic Rick: Are you listening, you stupid little garbage person?! (Shakes Toxic Morty) We re what got removed!   (Scene cuts to happy Rick and Morty walking out of the room as the doors open.)  Alien: I hope you both found that detox sufficiently relaxing.   Rick: Hey, man, listen Those comments I made about your throat?   Alien: (Clears throat and swallows.) (Puts his hands up.) It 2019s all good.   Rick: It 2019s nice of you to let me off the hook. It 2019s still unacceptable behavior, and I do regret it.   Alien: Believe me, man, I 2019ve been working here a long time. I get it.  (Scene cuts to Rick and Morty in the spaceship flying back home. They 2019re both happy and relaxed.)  Morty: Hey, uh, you mind if I put on some music?   Rick: Not at all.   (Morty presses a button that plays a song.)  Radio: Grab my terrifolds...  (They both bob their heads to the beat as they look at each other.)  Rick: What is that?   Morty: I just hit shuffle.   Rick: Are you kidding?   Morty: Haha.  Rick: This universe. (Burps) Oh, excuse me.   Morty: We should listen to one random song a day, you know? We 2019d end up hearing more songs we didn 2019t like, but we 2019d discover a lot more that we did.   Rick: That is an interesting concept. You know, it makes me wonder if there 2019s an algorithmic expression that could achieve the ideal ratio. Pfft! Listen to me, trying to calculate happiness over here.   Morty: Hoo, if anyone could, Rick.   Rick: Hey, here 2019s something no science could measure. I 2019m real proud to be your grandpa, Morty.   Morty: Thanks, Rick. I love you.  (Screen cuts back to Toxic Rick and Morty. Toxic Morty is sitting down while making a pot/vase, while Toxic Rick is mixing up chemicals.)  Toxic Rick: Yeah, motherfucker! Yeah! Get it! Get some! Right up your fucking bitch ass, you fuck! Guess who just discovered a new element?! You think you could do that, Morty? You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years? Do you think if God existed he could do it? The answer is no. If God exists, it 2019s fucking me!  Toxic Morty: Yes, Rick. I-I agree, Rick.  Toxic Rick: While you were flapping your parasitic turd holster, I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity, Morty. What do you think about that?   Toxic Morty: Uh I th-I think my voice is annoying.  Toxic Rick: It is, and it 2019s your best quality.  Toxic Morty: (Sad) So true.  (Scene cuts to Harry Herpson High School, where Mr. Goldenfold is teaching a math class.  Mr. Goldenfold: Now, who can tell me the common denominator of these two factions? You don 2019t know or y 2019all just bored?   Morty: Hey, listen, you know, wh-If we 2019re all bored over here, wouldn 2019t the common denominator be you?   (All the students laugh)  Mr. Goldenfold: Damn, Morty. That 2019s hilarious. Normally I would come down on any kind of disruption, but it seems to represent a positive change for your character. Class dismissed!   (The happy Students cheer.)  Off screen student: Awesome, Morty!  Student with glasses: You done good, Morty. (High fives him.)  Off screen student 2: Oh yeah!  (Scene cuts to Morty walking down the school hallway.)  Female student: Thanks for the advice, Morty.  Morty: You got it.  Female student 2: I did it, Morty!   Morty: I knew you could.  Mitch: Hey, Morty, remember yesterday when I couldn 2019t play the trombone? Well, check this out! (Plays a tune on his trombone.)  Morty: (Snapping his fingers) Just like I told you, Mitch. The music was in your heart the whole time.  Female student looking into her mirror: Stupid hat Wish I had the courage to just be myself.  (Morty takes her hat off.)  Female Student: (Smiles) There you are.  (Morty dances around to the trombone and stops in front of a bully.)  Bully: You might have all these idiots fooled, but I know you 2019re still the same pathetic loser hiding behind a confident facade. I know that because I 2019m doing the same thing, brother. I 2019m not alone anymore!   (Students celebrate and walk away.)  Jessica: Hey, Morty. Word around school is you 2019ve become super healthy.  Morty: I don 2019t know about all that. I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of haven 2019t taken you to dinner-itis. Might be fatal. Hahaha!  Rick: (Walks up to Morty and Jessica): Hey, kids. Uh, hope I 2019m not interrupting. Morty, a moment of your time?   Morty: Happy to help, Rick.  (Scene cuts to the car park outside the school.)  Rick: I hate to bug you with this, but after our morning hike I started receiving very faint, highly unusual transmissions on my sub ether phone. Listen.  (Rick pulls out his phone and plays a recorded message. Confused Morty listens to the distorted message, as it starts to sound like a growling creature and a crowd shrieking. Rick then stops the message.)   Morty: It 2019s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only. You know, if if if something 2019s worth saying, I-it 2019s worth eye contact.  Rick: Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call back to the spa we went to, Morty. I thought I could hear a voice in there, so I enhanced it, a-and listen.  (Rick plays the enhanced and distorted message.)  Toxic Rick: Hey, asshole!   Toxic Morty: Oh, man!   Toxic Rick: Remember us?   Toxic Morty: Oh, I don 2019t like confrontation!   (Morty listens with a blank stare.)  Toxic Rick: You fucked us, you pieces of garbage! That 2019s right, you 2019re fucking garbage, not us. I 2019m a fucking genius and a god. You really think this thing can hold me? I 2019m gonna rip your throat...   (Rick stops the audio.)  Rick: Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities, their own will to live?   (Rick and Morty both walk over to a red car and sit on it s front.)  Rick: W-What if mine shares my intelligence and devised a way to reach out to us?   Morty: Sounds like he 2019s in a lot of pain. Lot. O. Pain. But, you know, you shouldn 2019t have to deal with that, man. You know, l-let 2019s work off your trauma with some urban spin yoga. It 2019s amazing. You do yoga on a bike, but you have an at-risk preteen-  Rick:  I don 2019t think I can just blow this off, Morty. If I had known it worked this way, I wouldn 2019t have detoxed. Well, I would have because I was toxic. Now I 2019m detoxed and I 2019m accountable to my toxins, right? I-It 2019s a dilemma.  Morty: I think I know what to do. (Grabs Rick s phone and breaks it in half.)  Rick: Morty!  Morty: Rick! Haha. (Hops off the car.) You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain that misses eating all them big fat problems. Focus on the good thing. Trust me, things are good. Taking that away from me, heh. That wouldn 2019t be healthy.  (Rick stares at Morty, concerned.)  Morty: Hahaha! Hahahaha! Oh, man. World 2019s Greatest Grandpa, for reals. (Walks away.) It 2019s not just a coffee cup for you, bud. You 2019re legit. (Catches a football that was kicked towards him, and chucks it back to an off screen person.)  (Scene cuts to A restaurant. Morty is seen at a table with Jessica, and a waiter, who is writing down an order. Morty is drumming on the table.)   Morty: I love drums. I never took drum lessons. Why? Limitations. We are addicted to our own limitations. How amazing is that? Is the kale prepared in the kitchen? I 2019ll have a water.   Jessica: Uh How is the \""cru-dite?\""   Waiter: Crudit 00c3 00a9. It 2019s a cup of carrot sticks.  Morty: Ha! It 2019s okay! Pronounce it however you want. Words are just things. Please. Thank you. We 2019re having a conversation.  (The waiter leaves with the menus.)  Morty: God, I am so excited to finally have dinner with you. You know how long I 2019ve been waiting for this? It 2019s like, whew! I-I-I wish you 2019d shut up, though. Just kidding. You know, you 2019re so quiet. What 2019s wrong? W-Why don 2019t you tell me about yourself? What 2019s the atmosphere like on planet Jessica? Where 2019s the equator, what are the vacations, a-and the holidays? I mean, you know, haha, are they the same time? Talk to me.  Jessica: Well I... like this restaurant.  (Morty bashes on the table, startling Jessica.)  Morty: Holy shit! Holy shit! We have a moron over here! I 2019m an idiot. I can 2019t believe I haven 2019t thought of this. You have to do this detox thing I did. It 2019s an alien spa, you go through it, fwoos-s-s-ssh, lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa, wheeew wheeew! Sucks everything out. Everything that was holding me back, everything bad, I mean, it just sluuuurp! Hahaha! Right?   Jessica: (Awkwardly) Cooooool. (She grabs her phone and looks at it. It s out of battery.) Oh, my God! I can 2019t believe this.  Morty: Yeah, phones are awful, I downgraded to- (Goes to grab her phone but she interrupts him.)   Jessica: I totally forgot my I have a thing, and...   Morty: Things are good.  Jessica: You know what? Why am I doing that? That 2019s more rude than the truth. Look, I 2019m sorry, Morty. I just don 2019t think...   Morty: Do not. Even. You have no need to explain. It 2019s all good.   Jessica: I think you 2019d get bored with me. (Gets up out of her chair and leaves.)  Morty: E-Exactly. Look, the sparks aren 2019t flying. This is what dating is for, you know? First date, no sparks. No damage, no worries. Life is a highway. We 2019re gonna ride it all night lonnngg!   (The waiter comes back and hands him his food.)  Morty:  Gonna eat some \""crudite. Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm. (He looks around the restaurant.) All right. You know, the evening continues. (His attention is on this one girl who s sitting at the bar.) Okay, here we go.  (Morty walks up to the girl and grabs a chair to sit next to her.)  Morty: Ma 2019am, I 2019m afraid I have some bad news for you. Your money 2019s no good here. Haha! (To the Bar tender) I 2019ll I 2019ll get the next round, sir.  Stacy: Aren 2019t you a child?   Morty: Only in the ways that matter. Morty.  Stacy: (Sigh.) Stacy.  (Bar Tender gives Morty a drink.)  Morty: I 2019ve been watching you drink, Stacy. I get the feeling you 2019ve got a hard job. I wonder what it takes to please you. That 2019s the job I want Part time, full time, I want to be good at it, bad at it, I want to get promoted, fired, corner office, hostile takeover, workplace accident I 2019m on my knees, Stacy. Praying, worshipping, begging, whatever you want. (Sniff) What do you think about that?   Stacy: (Turns to look at Morty.) Okay. Fuck it.  (Morty and Stacy clink glasses.)  Morty: Tink.  (Scene cuts to Rick s garage. He is seen fixing up something. A taxi parks near the house, the taxi drives away as Morty and Stacy get out of it.)  Morty: (Kisses Stacy) Mm! Let 2019s ask my grandpa. He 2019s a scientist.  (They both walk into the garage.)  Morty: Hey, Rick, are you familiar with \""Ben Wa\"" technology?   Rick: (Get s up.) Morty, great news. I went back to the spa and they let me purchase the containment unit from their detoxifier.  Morty: Why?   Toxic Rick: (On the screen that s connected to the containment unit.) Because we 2019re coming home, bitch!   Morty: What is this?   Toxic Rick: This is the parts of your pussy grandpa that keep it real. Oh oh, and I think you dropped something, too! (He grabs Toxic Morty.)  Toxic Morty: I don 2019t want to be on camera. I 2019m ugly and gross, please.  Stacey: Should I go?   Morty: You 2019re your own person, Stacy.   Stacy: Then I 2019d like to stay.  (Toxic Rick puts Toxic Morty back down off screen.)  Morty: Rick, please tell me you 2019re not trying to put that stuff back inside of us.  Rick: Morty, I 2019m sorry. That stuff is alive and it belongs with us. We yanked them from their homes and locked them in a can. (Knocks on the containment unit, knocking Toxic Rick over.)  Toxic Rick: Motherfucker!   Rick: See? They 2019re living in pain.  Morty: That 2019s what they do, Rick, they live in pain. They are pain, you know? They they 2019re all the bad parts of us, which, by the way, includes our dishonesty, so how do you know this isn 2019t all some sort of crazy trick?  Toxic Rick: Oh, so now because I 2019m made entirely of toxins I 2019m also a liar? Fuck you, you little sociopath. (Grabs Toxic Morty again.)  You hear this, Morty?   Toxic Morty: Oh, everybody hates me. I can tell. Y-You all hate me.   Toxic Rick: (Puts him back down.) All right, shut up, Morty. Healthy Rick, are we doing this or what?   Rick: Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you to step into the booth. (Opens the door to the booth.)  Morty: (Shakes his head with his arms crossed.)  Toxic Rick: Don 2019t negotiate with that little turd, dummy. You 2019re the Rick. You need to show dominance. Morty, booth, now. (Toxic Rick grabs Toxic Morty and shoves him into the booth. He gets in too, and closes the door.)  Rick: Booth! Come on, Morty.  Morty: Don 2019t touch me!   Rick: Morty, do the healthy thing and voluntarily retoxify yourself. (Rick grabs Morty as they both struggle.)  Morty: Nooooo!   Stacy: Is it wrong if I think this is kind of hot?   (Rick pulls Morty into the booth with him.)  Morty: Let me out of here! Stacy, help! Open the door!   Stacy: I need to hear our safe word, Morty.  Morty: Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!   (Stacy opens the door and forcefully pulls Rick and Morty out of the booth.)  Rick: What are you doing?   (Stacy pushes them out.)  Stacy: I 2019ll do anything for you, Morty.  Rick: No!  (A giant cloud of gas whirls around Stacy, as Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty take her place.)  Toxic Rick: It worked! Haha! Yes! That idiot believed every word. Now let 2019s see how he enjoys living in that shit tank.  (Stacy opens the door to the booth inside the containment unit.)   Toxic Rick: He 2019s right behind me, isn 2019t he? (Looks behind him.)  Toxic Morty: He 2019s in front of you.  Toxic Rick: Oh. (Rubs eyes.) My eyes are still adjusting.  Stacy: (Through the screen.) Uh, is this like a sex dungeon? I guess I should 2019ve been paying attention.  (CUT)  (Scene continues.)  Toxic Rick: After 70 years of being bottled up inside a (Burp) sentimental jackass, I finally get to live my own life.  Rick: You said we were merging.  Toxic Rick: I lied, dumbass! I lie about everything! Why would I ever re-merge with a pussy like you?   Rick: So you were just gonna trap us in that tank? T-That was your plan?   Toxic Rick: Not was, motherfucker, still is.  (Toxic Rick punches Rick in the face, knocking him into the ground. Rick s nose starts to bleed.)  Morty: (Points to Toxic Rick.) Kill him, Rick!   Toxic Morty: (Hides behind the door to the booth.) I don 2019t like this! This is scary!   Rick: (Gets up, ready to fight with his fists up.) All right, you asked for it.  Toxic Rick: Did I ask for this? (Kicks Rick in the crotch. Rick groans in pain, grabbing his crotch.) Did I ask for this? (Grabs Rick s shoulders and repeatedly knees him in the crotch.) Huh? Did I?   (Rick falls into the ground, hugging his stomach.)  (A robot gun pokes out of Rick s belt buckle.)  Groin System 6000: Assessing threat to groin.  Toxic Rick: Groin System 6000. Kill him!   Groin System 6000: (Faces Rick, then looks back.) That... is my groin 2019s user.  Toxic Rick: Believe me, I got a lot more use out of that thing than he ever did.  Groin System 6000: You know what? Not my table. (Turns back into a belt buckle.)  (Rick gets back up, punching Toxic Rick in the jaw. Toxic Rick then grabs Rick and bashes him against his shelf and his wall, making a mess.)  (Scene cuts to Summer, watching tv in the living room. She s watching an episode of  The Days And Nights Of Mrs. Pancakes.  She doesn t notice the two Ricks fighting outside.)  Mrs. Pancakes: You do know me.  Summer: (Gasp.)  (toxic Rick grabs Rick and throws him through the glass door, smashing the door and the coffee table. Toxic Rick proceeds to punch Rick in the face some more.)  Summer: What the hell, Grandpa Rick?   Toxic Rick: Fuck you, Summer!   Rick: Sorry, Summer!   (Toxic Rick runs up to a house plant, pulling down one of it s leaves. It turns out to be a lever to a machine that dispenses a round grenade type device. He is about to pull the pin.)  Rick: Okay, okay, take it easy. Don 2019t do it.  (Toxic Rick pulls the pin, and the device opens up to reveal a little blue alien inside. Toxic Rick starts to caress is, as it grows bigger and bigger.)   Toxic Rick: I love you. Good boy. Daddy 2019s little boy.  Rick: Summer, get out of here! Go!   (Summer runs away to safety.)  Toxic Rick: Oh, who 2019s that?   (The creature grows bigger and changes color, as Rick somersaults over the couch, and to a secret compartment that he reveals under the carpet. It scans his hand.)  Toxic Rick: (Burp) Who 2019s that over there? Oh, no.  (The compartment opens up and shows a gun with an injection device on it. Rick injects himself with it.)  Toxic Rick: You see the bad man in front of you? You 2019re a good little boy, you 2019re gonna get him. You 2019re gonna get him.  (The large aggressive creature lunges towards Rick, but he shoots the gun injection at Toxic Rick before getting mauled to death by the alien monster.)  Toxic Rick: Ahh! Son of a... (He runs up to a bookshelf, pushing the books over to find a book that scans him and opens up to give him the same type of injection gun. He injects himself and shoots it at the monster, right before the injection he got took effect and a naked baby Rick bursts through his chest, killing him. It grows to Rick s normal age.) (The monster alien turns around and runs towards Rick, right before naked toxic Rick bursts through it, killing it.)  Toxic Rick: Nice try, asshole.  Rick: We can resolve (Huff) our issues. We don 2019t need to resort to over-the-top- Aah!   (Toxic Rick kicks Rick in the face, knocking him down.) (At that moment, Toxic Morty crashes through the walls of the living room with Rick s spaceship. The tank and the booth is attached to the back of it.)  Toxic Morty: I-I did it, Rick. I got the tank! I-I 2019m a piece of shit, but I got the tank!   Toxic Rick: You 2019re going in that tank, motherfucker. You 2019re gonna (burp) live in that toxic shit wasteland like I had to do!   (Morty runs out of nowhere and gets into the ship, biting Toxic Morty s head.)  Toxic Morty: Ahh! Ow! (Toxic Morty can t control the ship as it starts crashing all around the living room.) (Rick and Toxic Rick duck to avoid it. It eventually jams into a wall.)  Toxic Rick: That 2019s right, motherfucker! You 2019re going in that fucki-   (Beth walks into the living room with groceries. everyone just stares at her.  Beth: (Confused) Dads?   Rick: Okay, just Just leave her out of it.  Beth: What 2019s going on?   Toxic Rick: All right, fuck this. Time for plan B If I can 2019t trap you in a toxic world, (Climbs up to the ship, grabs Morty and throws him out.)  Morty: Ahh!  Toxic Rick: I 2019ll just make the whole world toxic. (Flips Rick off and crashes the spaceship through the roof, flying away.)  (Summer comes out from hiding.)  Rick: It 2019s okay, girls. I-I 2019m so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior. I-If you 2019d like I can go out in the g-garden, pick some fresh basil, and make us a nice Scallopini.  Beth: What did the booger version of you mean when he said he was going to make the whole world toxic?   Rick: Believe me, sweetie, that man 2019s motivations are a mystery.  Morty: Screw that, Rick. We got to stop him. What 2019s the last thing you 2019d think about doing with that tank thing?   Rick: (Walks up to Morty and bends down near him) Morty, I appreciate what you 2019re trying to do, but it 2019s not our place, you know, to pick and choose which world gets saved from what apocalypse. Our our toxins have as much a right to their worldview as-  (Morty slaps Rick.)  Rick: Morty, how is it healthy to slap me?   Morty: Obviously my version of health is a hell of a lot different from yours, you useless old turd.  Rick: Wait. That 2019s it. (Gets back up.)  How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it? It can 2019t. It must be by the individual 2019s own definition of toxicity. That means...   (Rick slaps Morty.)  Beth: Dad!   Morty: What the What the hell, Rick?   Rick: (Grabs Morty and runs.) I 2019ll explain on the way.  (Screen cuts to a large tower located near a factory. Toxic Rick has built a machine on it to toxify the earth.)  Toxic Rick: This \""Moon Tower,\"" Morty, (Burps) is the perfect height and metallic composition for the (burps) amplification and beaming of toxic energies. What do you think about that, Morty? Are you excited about that, Morty?   Toxic Morty: Oh, man. I 2019m just freaked out. I-It 2019s too high up here.  Toxic Rick: Once I flip this switch, the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us, baby. (He pulls the lever.)  (The machine lights up with electricity and sends rays of the toxic goop all over earth.)  (Screen cuts to an active church.)  Priest: As we praise our loving Father-   (The church get toxified.)   Priest: (Rips off his shirt.) God is a lie! We made him up for money!   (Everyone is the church immediately starts doing sexual things to each other.)  (Scene cuts to a street with food stores.)

Put your fucking hands in the air.  (Grabs Toxic Morty s arm and lifts it.) Yeah, you little piece of shit.  (Rick and Morty land behind them with jetpacks.) (Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty turn around.)  Rick: Remember me?   Toxic Rick: Didn 2019t you learn last time that you can 2019t beat me?   Rick: Yeah, I did. And then I learned something else. (Pulls a gun out of his lab coat.) This.  (Rick shoots Toxic Morty in the knee, causing him to collapse in pain.)  Toxic Morty: Ahh!!   Rick: That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.  Toxic Rick: You think I give a shit?   Rick: I know you give a shit, dummy. Because I know I don 2019t. Here 2019s another thing I know. The decryption key that neutralizes the virus. (He pulls put an injection with a tube to the other injection part.) You want it? Come and get it. Merge with me and you 2019ll know how to save him.  Toxic Rick: Pfft. Come on, man. I 2019ve been trapped in your pussy brain for 70 years of delusions, but this is the all-time weakest bluff that I 2019ve ever-  (Rick shoots Toxic Morty in his other knee, causing him to yell out in pain again.)  Toxic Morty: Ow-Ohh!!   Toxic Rick: (Dodges the bullet.) Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!   Morty: He 2019s cutting your time in half. 10 minutes.  Toxic Morty: Ohh! It hurts!   Toxic Rick: What is your problem?   Rick: Oh, I had all my problems removed my entitlement, my narcissism, my crippling loneliness, my irrational attachments.  (Toxic Rick glances at hurt Toxic Morty, and looks back as his eye twitches.)  Rick: They must be somewhere. They ain 2019t over here, bro.  Toxic Rick: I 2019m not going back in there!   Rick: Honestly, I don 2019t care either way. I hate having you in me. And when I say \""honestly\"" you can believe it, because we both know I 2019m too healthy to lie. Watch.  (Rick shoots Toxic Morty for the third time. This time, in the shoulder. He continues to cry out in pain as he holds his bleeding shoulder. He s getting weaker and weaker.)  Toxic Rick: All right! Knock it off! You 2019re not impressing anyone. (He kneels down and holds Toxic Morty.) Morty, not that I give a shit, but are you okay?   Toxic Morty: Jesus Christ, it hurts.  Toxic Rick: Relax, quit your bitching. Y-You 2019re gonna be fine. Grandpa 2019s here.  Rick: Hahahahahaha.  Toxic Rick: You think that 2019s funny?   Rick: Y-You got to have a sense of humor about these things. Oh, wait, you can 2019t. You 2019re literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture. I guess it 2019s just funny because you 2019ve never done anything but complain about me being in charge, but if I ever gave you the wheel we 2019d be dead in five minutes.  Toxic Morty: Ah, Rick?  Rick: You poor, dumb, sick animal.  Toxic Morty: Augh... Rick?  Toxic Rick: Ahh! (Gets up and walks towards Rick.) Just do it! Just do it, you piece of-  (Rick injects Toxic Rick in the head, then injects himself with the other end. He then presses a button, sucking Toxic Rick into the tube and back into himself.)  Rick: Aaahhh! I 2019m back, baby! (Dances around.) Regular Rick! Master of both worlds! Check it it out! (Farts in Morty s face.) Excuse me. (Walks up to the lever.) Now we 2019ll just reverse this hacky toxicity beam. Man, I really over think shit when I 2019m angry.  (Rick lifts the lever. The machine sucks the toxicity back up.)  (Scene cuts back to the Church. The people are still doing sexual acts, until the toxic goo goes away. They suddenly stop doing what they were doing.)  Priest: God is not a lie.

(Scene cuts to the childrens birthday party. The kids are seen killing each other and making monkey noises, and the man mascot is massacred.

All right, Morty, now it 2019s time we re-merge your little ass.  (Morty is seen flying away with his jet pack.)   Morty: You 2019re a better man than me, Rick. I 2019m healthy enough to admit that!   Rick: That kid is a real piece of shit.  Toxic Morty: (Moaning in pain.) Y-Y-You 2019re gonna save me, right?   Rick: (Picks up Toxic Morty.) Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty. Part of me really wanted to. (He sticks the injection into Toxic Morty.)  (Scene cuts to a workplace somewhere in the city in a large building. Everyone inside are busy working.)  Worker: (On the phone.) I 2019m telling you, these shares are hot.  Worker 2:(On the phone.) Yeah. That sounds like a good idea. It 2019s definitely a good idea.  Morty: (Also on the phone.) Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me? Have I ever lied to you? (Grabs an apple on his desk.) That 2019s right, and ask around, I never do, Duane.  (Workers quiet down to listen to Morty s call.)  Morty: Let me put this real simple. This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single, not looking to date but ready to fall in love, and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane Two lockers down. (Winks at two female workers. They both giggle.) So step up or step off, Duane. Blue pill or red pill, what 2019ll be, bro? Totally understand, Duane. You 2019re the boss. (Stops the call.) Heinholz Biotech Million and a half at thirty-three. (Bites the apple as everyone cheers and throws their papers.)  Worker in a red shirt: (Catches the apple.) Heh.You little fucking monster.  (Scene cuts to Morty s apartment in another tall building. He s cutting up carrots for a snack.)  Morty: Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm! (Morty s phone rings, and he answers, as he walks up to his window at the view.) Go for Morty.  Jessica on the phone: Hi, Morty. It 2019s Jessica. Look, can we just talk for a minute?   Morty: Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location?   Jessica: Come back, Morty. I miss you.  Morty: You miss the old me. You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love  2018em back.  (A redhead is seen opening the kitchen door.)  Jessica: How do you know I don 2019t want to love you?   Morty: Because I 2019m not sick. (Presses a button.)  Jacquelyn: (Sits at the bench.) Ex-girlfriend? Should I be jealous?   Morty: (Puts his phone on the bench.) There 2019s nothing to be jealous of.  Jacquelyn: (Sigh) I just realized that I 2019m scheduled to speak at that fundraiser on our date night. I can cancel.  Morty: We 2019ll be together. That 2019s a date.  Jacquelyn: You are the perfect man. (Notices Morty s phone.) Oh, sweetie, (Picks it up to show Morty.) I think you hit the wrong button. You didn 2019t hang up.  Morty: Huh. How  2018bout that?   (Six robot drones suddenly crash through the window. One hovers near Jacuelyn, armed, and the others wrap around Morty, keeping him in place.) (A portal appears on the ceiling and Jessica and Rick fall through it.)  Rick: Sorry, tiny American Psycho, (Holds up the injection.) time to take the opposite of your medicine.  Morty: Do what you got to do.  (Rick injects Morty, as he screams in pain. The robot drones let go of him, as he falls to the ground, his limbs having a painful spasm.)  Morty: Oh! Ow! Ahh! (Eventually, Morty gets up.)  Jessica: So, how do you feel, Morty?   Morty: Ah, geez. I 2019m miserable.  Rick: Am I good or what?   Morty: I guess it 2019s worth it, though, to know how much you care.  Jessica: Care? Me? Morty, I 2019m fine with you. I only did this for him. (Points at Rick.)  Rick: You lying bitch. She kept coming to our house, Morty, and kept asking me. \""Did did d-did you get a new Morty yet?\""   Jessica: Because you kept drunk dialing me and crying about it.  Rick: I wasn 2019t crying!   (Rick and Jessica continue to argue.)  Morty: Jacquelyn, I I-I-I wasn 2019t who I said I was.  Jacquelyn: You weren 2019t a 14-year-old boy from the Midwest who ran away from his family and capitalized on his lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker?   Morty: Oh. I guess I was pretty up front about that, wasn 2019t I?   Jacquelyn: You were up front about everything. You were my soul mate.  Morty: Well No-Not anymore. I 2019ll, um Y-You can keep the apartment, and and and, uh the drones.  Rick: She can 2019t keep the drones. They turn into a little Voltron robot. They 2019re awesome.  (Robot drones transform into a Voltron robot.)  Rick: You can 2019t keep the drones.  (Scene cuts to Harry Herpson High School.

Our Rick and Morty refute the possibility of donation with hostility, pointing out that our Rick was the one to destroy it in the first place, and the pair leave.  The scene then cuts to show a fully-fledged, well-developed Citadel, which has extended beyond being a mere government into the territory of being a (mostly) functional society consisting only of Ricks and Mortys. The Citadel makes quick work of recuperating from Rick's attempted destruction of it, with workers restructuring its foundation, commuters proceeding with their work and an election going on. Contention surrounds the fact that a Morty has decided to run a political campaign, with the news anchor Ricks sardonically and aggressively defaming him on the news, leading [[Campaign Manager Morty]] to suggest that [[President Morty|Candidate Morty]] withdraw from the race. Despite this, Candidate Morty refuses.  Meanwhile, a Morty Pride rally/protest is occurring on the streets. Here, a newly recruited [[Cop Rick]], while standing outside the [[Cafe Sanchez]], is surprised to discover that he has been paired with a jaded and critical [[Cop Morty]], who possesses anti-Morty sentiments and tasers any Morty that gets close to his car, calling them slurs such as \""yellow-shirts\"", (much to the surprise of Cop Rick). Despite being called out, Cop Morty digresses that no one cares about broken codes or corruption. The pair are called to attend to a robbery committed in \""Mortytown,\"" a ghetto populated by Mortys who, for some reason or another, were deemed unsuitable for pairing with another Rick.  While this occurs, a Morty school is in session, where Mortys are being educated on how to act for when they are <span style=\""font-weight:400;\"">been</span> reassigned a new Rick. After the lesson, they are told they will graduate and be assigned a new Rick the following day. Hearing this, [[Lizard Morty]], [[Glasses Morty]] and [[Left-Handed Morty]] (Left Hand Morty) are encouraged by [[Slick Morty]] to make the most of their small amount of time left together by going to the \""wishing portal\"". The four eventually agree to embark on the journey together.  As this takes place, a [[Simple Rick\u2019s Wafer Cookie factory|factory]] producing Simple Rick's wafers (wafers doused in the psychic resonance of Simple Rick and his memory of having spent time with a young [[Beth Smith|Beth]] on her birthday), the Rick who would later become the Factory Terrorick ([[Rick J-22]]) is passed by for a promotion in favor of [[Cool Rick]] (K-83).  Meanwhile, Cop Rick and Cop Morty arrive in Mortytown to investigate the reported robbery, where Cop Rick learns more about the resident Mortys and what conditions they live with. The pair question the Morty Mart Manager Morty, who describes the robbers' appearances as four normal-looking Mortys. Whilst Cop Rick attempts to attain more information, Cop Morty uses his Morty-like nature to attempt to get some insider information from some vandalizing Mortys. After the vandalizing Mortys criticize him on his uniform and his relation to Rick, Cop Morty snaps, forcefully interrogating them and learning that a group called the \""Mortytown Locos\"" were the ones who committed the crime. Cop Rick, shocked at Cop Morty's violation of codes, is ordered to get back into the car.  During this, the Presidential Election Campaign has commenced, with the candidate Ricks all providing their own solutions to issues currently surrounding the Citadel. When the time comes for Politician Morty to offer his solution to the social divide between Ricks and Mortys, he is mocked by his rivals. However, he answers with clarity and delivers the conclusion that the great divide is a result of the death of the Citadel, and that the main solution is recognizing how there are many Ricks and Mortys who believe in the Citadel's prosperity and success, as opposed to those who don't. As the crowd responds with great applause, Campaign Manager Morty is amazed by Politician Morty's success, to which Politician Morty responds by firing him.  As Politician Morty delivers his message, Rick J-22 manages to snap in rage, killing the Regional Manager Rick and forcing himself to retreat into the Simple Rick's Factory's Flavor Core with an unconscious Simple Rick, locking the room around him. As he is shown trapped in the room, SWAT Team Ricks begin to swarm the building, attempting to negotiate and rationalize with Rick J-22, but with no success.  As Campaign Manager Morty watches the event unfold on the TV from a bar, the news coverage switches back towards the highly-likely victory for Politician Morty and his speeches. Displaying his negative feelings of the situation, Campaign Manager Morty is then confronted by [[Investigator Rick]], who delivers some secret files and warns him that he should be fearful of what is to come.  In Mortytown, the Mortytown Locos are also watching the same speeches, as Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick is attempting to create Bootleg Portal Fluid for inter-dimensional transport. At the same time, Cop Rick and Cop Morty break down the door, apprehending three of the Mortytown Locos. [[Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick]] attempts to escape through his own portal fluid, only to be killed due to issues of its bootleg-nature. Cop Rick then scouts around upstairs to find the fourth member of the Mortytown Locos, who plays with Rick's sympathy and stabs him in the shoulder. Rick quickly shoots the fourth member, and Cop Morty comforts Rick, saying that it is alright to put your faith in Mortys, but only the right ones. As Rick leaves to get medical treatment, Cop Morty then destroys the building.  Meanwhile, Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, Slick Morty, and Left-Handed Morty attempt to take some mega fruit, only to be chased off into a stream by an angry Mega Fruit Farmer Rick and his robot dog. As time turns to night, the group then gather around a campfire, where they converse over their wishes. Slick Morty, however, presents negative, dramatic opinion, causing Glasses Morty to comfort him by clarifying that he is more than just a dramatic person.  Whilst this occurs, Politician Morty leaves ''Hard Rick'' Cafe to a large crowd of Ricks and Mortys who are excited over his recent statements. Within this crowd, Politician Morty spots his former Campaign Manager Morty and asks about his job search. Campaign Manager Morty states his new job is to assassinate Politician Morty as he pulls a gun from his jacket and shoots Politician Morty, causing him to bleed and lose consciousness. Campaign Manager Morty is then swiftly tasered by a Secret Service Rick, causing him to be apprehended.  Following their recent handling of the Mortytown Locos, Cop Morty takes Cop Rick to a club called The Creepy Morty, where he meets [[Big Morty]], a drug-lord who presents Cop Rick and Cop Morty with money for their efforts. Cop Rick, having moral issues with this action, attempts to make an arrest of Big Morty, but causes a shootout in the club. During this shootout, Cop Morty tackles Big Morty to the ground, ready to kill. However, Cop Rick attempts to get Cop Morty to do the right thing, knowing he is capable of doing so. Cop Morty attempts to play with Rick's sympathy, only to end Big Morty by surprise, but Rick expected it this time and kills him before he can turn on him. Cop Rick leaves the club, where he surrenders to the other police officers over the death of the many Mortys in the club.  Meanwhile, Rick J-22's negotiation for a working portal gun seemingly succeeds, causing the SWAT Team Ricks to deliver him a portal gun. Rick J-22 then awakens Simple Rick from his long unconscious state and sends him through the portal first, revealing that the dimension the portal gun was set to was the [[Blender Dimension]] and leads to Simple Rick's death. As he holds no leverage, the SWAT team finally cut a hole in the door to rush in, only to be stopped by [[Rick D. Sanchez III]], who sympathizes with Rick J-22, letting him go free. However, as he is set free, a narrative voice appears again, revealing that Rick J-22's attempted escape is just a replaying memory which the company is feeding off of to create their new product.  Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, Slick Morty, and Left-Handed Morty all manage to get to the Wishing Portal, where they all throw something of value to them in return for a wish. Left-Handed Morty throws in his panini maker, wishing for a million sandwiches, while also acknowledging the irony of his wish. Lizard Morty throws in his surfer necklace, wishing for something better in return. Glasses Morty throws in a piece of technology, wishing for incest porn to be more mainstream. However, Slick Morty becomes sad and expresses his wish for life to change for Mortys, ultimately throwing himself into the portal. It is then later revealed that the portal is part of a garbage dump.  Meanwhile, Campaign Manager Morty is thrown into an airlock chamber by Secret Service Ricks, revealing to him that his assassination attempt failed and that Politician Morty will become the President of the Citadel. Campaign Manager Morty attempts to warn them that Politician Morty is not who he seems, but the Secret Service Ricks disregard him, sending him out into the vacuum of space.  Cop Rick is shown in a small interrogation room, ready to accept his punishment, when council members enter, telling him that he is free and none of his actions matter, due to the changes in department codes.  Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, and Left-Handed Morty return to Morty School, only to find Teacher Rick to be locking the doors, revealing that no Ricks will be coming for the graduation and that he is fired, due to changes in the curriculum. The trio believes that Slick Morty's wish came true, where now a new, different life is available for Mortys.  Rick D. Sanchez III enters a room with the [[Shadow Council of Ricks]] and the new President Morty. One member of the Council, Garment District Rick, then raises his opinion, stating that it doesn't matter who sits in the president's chair as the Council has, and always will, have control over the Citadel. President Morty, who has his back to them, responds to this by holding up his mirror and having the Ricks raise their hand if they agree with that statement before calling his guards to assassinate those who agreed. President Morty then asks the surviving Ricks, who are all now terrified, if they will obey and they agree.  A montage shows new banners being deployed, Cop Rick going back to work, the trio of Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, and Left-Handed Morty clad in new uniforms and harvesting mega fruits, and the corpses of the council members being dragged into airlock chambers, while President Morty ponders about making a \""cold, calculated speech with sinister overtones\"" about the changes in politics, about order, brotherhood, and power, only to declare that, now that he is elected, the time for speeches is over and he can finally act.  The dead council members are expelled into space, where they join the floating bodies of many Ricks and Mortys, including Cop Morty, Big Morty, Investigator Rick, and lastly Campaign Manager Morty, shown next to the secret documents which reveal the newly-elected \""President Morty\"" is none other than the former [[President Morty|Eye Patch Morty]] who had controlled [[Evil Rick Sanchez|\""Evil\"" Rick\""]] in \""[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]\"".  In the post-credit scene, Rick C-137 and his Morty return from their Atlantis adventure, where they boast and recollect about their sexual interactions with the mermaids. Morty asks Rick if he is concerned at all about the Citadel's return, to which he confidently responds that such a place \""will never have any bearing over [their] lives ever again\"".",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

We 2019re going from reality to reality, asking Ricks to contribute to the [[Citadel of Ricks]] redevelopment fund.     Rick:    What are you, stupid? We 2019re done with the Citadel of Ricks.

I didn 2019t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.     Rick:    *straps harpoon gun to his back* Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis. *shoots a portal* Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.

Morty Pride Parade]  (A parade of Mortys marches down the street. Many Mortys hold signs. There are a few Ricks among the spectators. Cop Rick watches from outside Cafe Sanchez, drinking a coffee. A police cruiser pulls up, nearly hitting two Mortys who run out of the way just in time. It stops in front of Cop Rick and the passenger window rolls down, revealing Cop Morty behind the wheel.)     Cop Rick:    Oh! S-sorry, I was expecting--     Cop Morty:    A Rick partner? Lesson one, rookie: expect the unexpected. Now get in.  (Cop Rick climbs into the passenger seat. Cop Morty starts the cruiser and drives slowly as they approach a cluster of Mortys. One Morty jumps against the hood of the car.)     Morty:    Mortys are human!

Their shirts were yellow!     Cop Morty:    *sarcastically* Yeah, make sure you get that down.     Cop Rick:    Any mutations? Augmentations? Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut?     Morty Mart Morty:    No, just four normal Mortys.     Purple Trunk Morty:    00a0*feels annoyed* \""   Normal   \""?     Morty Mart Morty:    00a0*talks back to Purple Morty* Put it in your blog.     Cop Morty:    *looking at two Mortys in a nearby alley* Lemme turn over a few rocks.  (Cop Morty approaches the two street Mortys as they spraypaint the alley wall.)     Cop Morty:    Aw geez, hey, what 2019s goin 2019 on, fellas?     Morty 1:    Aw geez, man, nothin 2019 man, we 2019re just hangin 2019 out and stuff.     Cop Morty:    I hear that, ah geez, I guess I 2019m supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno.     Morty 2:    *smirking* Ah geez man, that sucks that your Rick 2019s makin 2019 you do that.     Cop Morty:    *angered* He 2019s not my Rick. He 2019s my partner. Aw, geez.     Morty 1:    Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say? To me, you just look like a sidekick.  (Cop Morty snaps in a fit of rage and pins Morty 1 to the wall, shoving a large gun in his mouth.)     Cop Morty:    CALL ME A SIDEKICK ONE MORE TIME! 00a0CALL ME A SIDEKICK!!     Morty 2:    Hey man! C 2019mon, aw geez!  (Cop Rick looks on, seemingly uncertain what to do.)     Cop Morty:    WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL?!     Morty 2:    It was the [[Mortytown Locos]], man! The Mortytown Locos!  (Cop Morty releases Morty 1. Both street Mortys flee. Cop Morty walks back to the cruiser.)     Cop Rick:    Do you realize how many codes you just violated?     Cop Morty:    Aw geez, Rick. What do I know about knowin 2019 stuff? Get in the fucking car.  [Trans. Presidential Debate]  (The five Rick candidates and Candidate Morty stand at podiums.)     Retired General Rick:    More lasers.     Moderator Rick:    You can take more time to answer the question if you 2019d like.   (Retired General Rick remains silent for a long beat. Moderator Rick crosses his list and moves on.)     Moderator Rick:    ...Okay, Juggling Rick. How would you solve the Citadel 2019s financial crisis?     Juggling Rick:    First off, can I just say that I think this Citadel is the greatest in the entire multiverse. Now, I believe the answer to your question has three parts. (He reveals he 2019s holding three balls.) First, education spending must get   muuuch   higher! *starts tossing one ball*  [Int. Behind the scenes]  (Behind the scenes, Campaign Manager Morty watches the debate on a screen.)     Juggling Rick:    But it has to be balanced with defense! *starts juggling all three balls* Whoa!     Campaign Manager Morty:    Can we fact-check this, please? Never mind, who am I kidding? This race is over.     Juggling Rick:    *now juggling three balls and a chainsaw, he catches them all gracefully* And that 2019s how you run a Citadel. *bows*  (Ricks and Mortys in the audience cheer.)     Moderator Rick:    Candidate Morty. The number of displaced Mortys is soaring, while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting, and the divide between the two groups has never been wider. *smirks* Solve that one real quick.  (The audience laughs, but Candidate Morty looks calm.)     Candidate Morty:    I don 2019t see a divide between Ricks and Mortys.     Retired General Rick:    Oh, shocker. *farts*     Reverse Rick Outrage:    I 2019d like to offer a rebuttal. *farts*     Rick Guilt Rick:    Gentlemen, gentlemen! I think we can all agree on one thing. *farts twice* Well, came out as two things, but you get the idea.  (All laugh but Candidate Morty.)     Candidate Morty:    You guys finished? (Continues his speech.) The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go.  (Candidate Morty 2019s voice can be heard as other scenes are shown.)     Candidate Morty:    I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys we 2019re all the same because they 2019re threatened by what makes us unique.  (Slick, Glasses, Lizard, and Fat Morty sneak out of the school through a window.)     Candidate Morty:    I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so we 2019re too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice.  (Cop Rick and Cop Morty drive up to see one of the Mortytown Locos walking into an alleyway. Cop Morty slides the top of his laser gun.)     Candidate Morty:    I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss 2019s salary, even though they 2019re identical and have the same IQ. The Citadel 2019s problem isn 2019t homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks.   (Rick J-22 works at his post in the wafer factory, but becomes enraged, breaks off a piece of machinery to use as a weapon, and enters Supervisor Rick 2019s office, where he 2019s watching the debate. He shoots Supervisor Rick to death. Rick J-22 then sees numerous Ricks witness his actions through the office window.)     Candidate Morty:    The Citadel 2019s problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadel 2019s debt.      Rick J-22:    Holy shit. (As the alarm rings, he runs out of the office and enters the Flavor Core chamber.)     Rick Worker:    He s headed for the Flavor Core!  (Rick J-22 puts the chamber on lockdown and activates a red force field-like barrier around the chamber. He then encounters Simple Rick in front of him, slumping down on the floor.)     Candidate Morty:    But I 2019ve got a message for them, from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. A message 2026 from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that don 2019t: you are outnumbered!  (Debate audience bursts into applause.)  [Int. Backstage]     Campaign Manager Morty:    Holy shit. (Candidate Morty walks backstage.) I don 2019t believe it! I-I can 2019t believe it!     Candidate Morty:    I know. *puts a hand on his shoulder* That 2019s why you 2019re fired. *walks away*  (Campaign Manager Morty looks downcast. He 2019s approached by Juggling Rick.)     Juggling Rick:    Sounds like you 2019re looking for work. I can offer you a very enticing compensation package. *sets down bag and unzips it, pulling out three juggling clubs* First, let 2019s talk benefits.  [Trans. Int. Flavor core]  (Rick J-22 paces in the chamber he shares with Simple Rick while a Rick SWAT team stands outside.)     Simple Rick:    *mumbling to self* Daddy loves you 2026 That 2019s Daddy 2019s good girl.     Rick J-22:    *to Simple Rick* Your life is a lie, man. *to police* All your lives are lies! Don 2019t you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Ricks, but they stripped us of anything that made us unique!     Negotiator Rick:    *through megaphone* We know how you feel. We 2019re working stiff Ricks just like you, but our assembly line is justice. What are your demands?     Rick J-22:    *burp* I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison!     SWAT Team Rick:    The media 2019s outside.     Negotiator Rick:    Well, keep  2018em there!  [Trans. Ext. Simple Rick 2019s Wafer Cookie factory]  (CN correspondent Rick D716-C reports on the scene.)     Rick D716-C:    Anyway, so yeah, the suspect says the Citadel is a lie, built on lies, and some other shit. (Now sharing the screen with Rick D716 and Rick D716-B.) I say, appreciate the life you have, because it can always be worse. Back to you, Ricks.     Rick D716:    Thank you, Rick 716-C. *mumbling to D716-B* That fuckin 2019 guy.     Rick D716-B:    Tell me about it.  [Trans. Newsroom]     Rick D716:    Ahem. Meanwhile, in election news, an unexpected turn of events as Morty from the Morty Party soars to the top of the polls.  [Trans. Press conference]  (Candidate Morty approaches a podium while reporter Ricks call out to him.)     Candidate Morty:    Yes?     Reporter Rick:    Morty! What 2019s your original reality and where 2019s your Rick?     Candidate Morty:    Gosh. We moved around so much it 2019s hard to remember. I see every Rick as my Rick.  [Trans. Barroom]  (The press conference is on the bar TV. Campaign Manager Morty watches.)     Candidate Morty:    I hope they see me as their Morty.     Campaign Manager Morty:    *holding glass* Another, please, with less water.     Bartender Morty:    *fixing a new drink* Hey, cheer up, pal! A Morty 2019s gonna be president. *gestures to TV* Imagine this kisser gettin 2019 blamed for everything!  (Bartender Morty walks away. Campaign Manager Morty takes a drink.)     Campaign Manager Morty:    I guess I shoulda had more faith.  (Investigator Rick is sitting a few seats down the bar.)     Investigator Rick:    It 2019s not faith you need. It 2019s fear.  (Investigator Rick takes out a dossier from inside his trenchcoat and slides it over to Morty, who takes it uncertainly.)     Campaign Manager Morty:    What 2019s this?     Investigator Rick:    *drains his glass* It 2019s secrets. Wh-wh-what do you think it is? *Gets up and walks away* Look at how I 2019m dressed.     Rick Reporter (on TV):    Taking on the system like this, are you afraid at all for your safety?  (Campaign Manager Morty pulls out the documents in the dossier and looks them over.)     Candidate Morty (on TV):    I 2019d rather live in hope than fear. (Campaign Manager Morty looks shocked at the documents, then looks up at the TV.) If I had to fear anything, I 2019d fear other people being afraid. Of fear. Itself.  [Trans. Int. Mortytown Locos hideout]  (The Mortytown Locos sit around a TV watching the press conference while their Rick prepares bootleg portal fluid in a setup similar to a meth lab.)     Candidate Morty (on TV):    But no, I 2019m not afraid.     Mortytown Loco:    Hey Rick, man, when there 2019s a Morty president, you gonna lick my balls or what?  (Other Mortys laugh.)     Bootleg Rick:    Shit, grandson, you keep me peelin 2019 squap-squams and slippin 2019 nib-nibs I 2019ll lick whatever ain 2019t nailed down.  (Mortytown locos laugh and high-five. Suddenly the front door is kicked in. Cop Morty and Cop Rick enter with guns drawn.)     Cop Rick:    Hands in the air!  (All the Mortys stand and raise their hands.)     Mortytown Loco:    What the hell, man? What the hell in hell?  (Cops enter the building, guns still drawn.)     Cop Morty:    You guys doin 2019 a little chemistry homework with Grandpa?     Cop Rick:    Is this what I think it is?     Cop Morty:    Bootleg portal fluid.  (Bootleg Rick grabs his portal gun and tries to escape, but upon making contact with the faulty portal, he disintigrates.)     Cop Morty:    Guess his math was off. Search the place.  (Cop Rick goes further into the building while Cop Morty subdues the Mortytown Locos. Rick enters a bedroom with his gun drawn only to encounter a weeping Psychopath Morty.)     Psychopath Morty:    A-Are you 2026 m-my new 2026 Rick?  (Cop Rick lowers his gun and approaches Morty.)     Cop Rick:    It 2019s okay, Morty.  (He picks up Psychopath Morty to carry him to safety. Psychopath Morty pulls out a blade and stabs Rick in the shoulder. Cop Rick falls to his knees and shoots Psychopath Morty. Cop Morty runs to the room.)     Cop Morty:    Jesus!     Cop Rick:    He stabbed me! He got me bad, Morty.     Cop Morty:    *approaches Rick and kneels down beside him* Shh, it 2019s okay, you 2019re okay.     Cop Rick:    You were right 2026 *cough* Everything I learned in the academy was--     Cop Morty:    It doesn 2019t matter. *helps Rick to his feet* Nothing 2019s wrong with putting your faith in a Morty. You just gotta pick the right one.     Cop Rick:    Why is there a crib in here?     Cop Morty:    Just somethin 2019 they do to make you feel bad.  (In the front room, the Mortytown Locos have their hands cuffed and legs shackled.)     Cop Rick:    Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh?     Cop Morty:    Go to the car and grab a MediPack. Lemme worry about this.  (Cop Rick goes outside to treat his stab wound. Cop Morty walks out of the building moments later as it disintegrates in a greenish blast, killing the Mortys inside. Cop Morty gets to the cruiser.)     Cop Rick:    What happened?     Cop Morty:    Same old story. Mortys killing Mortys.  (Morty gets in the car. Rick stands pensively by the wreckage.)  [Trans.

Lizard Morty:    I bet it leads to a place where a bunch of fri-- flies everywhere! *Slick feels peevish*     Slick:    Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet it s a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams.

Escher's painting \""Relativity\"" in which there are stairs all over the place and the rules. Morty is seen holding a turtle-like creature named the \""Truth Tortoise.\"" Morty looks at the Truth Tortoise, despite Rick's warnings, and causes Morty to drop the creature in a void. The place collapses, but not before the duo escapes.  Both of them arrive to the Smith residence. Rick wants both of them to watch Interdimensional Cable, but Morty complains about the looping memory in his head and asks Rick to erase the memory off his mind. So Rick leads Morty to a secret chamber underneath the garage, which contains various tubes that archives memories Morty wanted Rick to remove. Rick calls them \""Morty's Mind Blowers\"" hence the title, then faces the audience telling them that they will be doing this instead of watching Interdimensional Cable.  Morty asks Rick how long he ever wanted to remove certain memories, and Rick just replies that he wanted to \""ever since your (Morty) mind was blown.\"" Rick grabs a blue tube and nicknames it \""Moon-spiracy\"" just before Rick activates the helmet and places the tube on the hole of the helmet.  The memory starts off with Morty and a telescope just outside their front lawn. Morty at first admires the American flag planted on the lunar surface before he notices a strange figure standing in a mid-stride walking pose. He then goes and tells his family, but nobody, including Rick, believes him; they suggest that it was merely a smudge on the lens. He then finds out that Mr. Lunas is, in fact, a real person, as he comes to Morty's high school to work as a guidance counselor. Later on, Morty snaps pictures of Lunas, planting an American flag in his yard, and tells Principal Vagina that he thinks Lunas is \""up to something\"" and \""lives on the moon.\"" Vagina takes this as a metaphor for pedophilia and goes outside to the parking lot to confront Lunas, ending in Lunas getting punched in the face. As a result of this accusation, Lunas goes home and commits suicide, which Morty finds out about from the ambulances outside of Lunas' home. Morty later eavesdrops on Lunas' funeral, where it is learned that Lunas served in the Marine Corps, and that \""from a certain angle, some people would say he looked like a smudge.\"" Morty then runs home and sees that there is, in fact, a smudge on his telescope lens, realizing that he inadvertently drove Lunas to kill himself.  Morty ended up inserting memories on his own. He started to remember Beth choosing Summer's life over his, Beth, Summer, and Rick insulting Morty as Voltematron forces himself back into Morty's mouth, Rick killing an animal that helped them find water and having him and Morty enter its guts after confusing Venzenulon 7 with Venzenulon 9, Rick tricking NASA employees into rescuing them so they could replace him and Morty in a menagerie, Morty getting chased by a hoard of squirrels after learning they controlled the world forcing him and Rick to move to a new reality again, Rick sending lambs to the Cosmic Slaughter, Morty having his hand chopped off, Rick hunting Morty as a ghost, Morty's head being attached to Snowball's body, Rick juggling Morty's body parts, Morty being eaten and pooped out by an alien, Mr. Poopybutthole proposing to Morty, etc. Rick also happened to have erased memories from Morty that involved Rick himself getting embarrassed just to secure his own pride.  After realizing that Rick also took away memories without Morty asking or even wanting him to, Morty gets enraged and attacks Rick, pinning him to the floor. Rick manages to use the mind eraser on Morty, but Morty turns the tables and points the device at Rick while it's still being used. This causes them to not remember each other. Trying to find out who they are, Morty uses the helmet and goes through many more traumatic memories until he snaps and decides to kill himself over it, while Rick joins in as part of the suicide pact.  Summer enters as Rick and Morty have guns to their own heads. When Rick doesn't remember her, Summer quickly realizes the situation. She reveals that Rick had a contingency plan should this happen (and has used it several times before) and tranquilizes them, restores both of their memories and drags them to the living room. Rick and Morty wake up on the couch. They believe that they slept through an entire \""Interdimensional Cable\"" episode as Rick questions how that even happened. The two then hurl verbal abuse at Summer and decide to head off on another adventure. Summer moans that this is the reason the two are \""''constantly fighting and behind schedule''\"".

Now I know their religion s real.  They have a hell, and it does not look good.  I noticed you never finished your chimichanga, so I got some room for it now, if you know what I mean.  Holy sh1t!  How many of these are just horrible mistakes I ve made?  I mean, maybe I d stop making so many if I let myself learn from them!  Don t break your back creating a lesson, Morty.

You re doing it!  You re doing it!  ( Gagging, coughing )  Should we pull it out?  No, don t touch it.  Just keep loving Morty!  We still love you.  But I do have a thing at 6:00.

So if the blues ones are my fault, and the purple ones are my family s, what are the red ones?  Yeah, d-don t read into it, Morty!  ( Birds chirping )  Ahh.  sh1t! We need to find shelter before the sunset, Morty.  Venzenulon Nine has a night temperature of 300 below!  We ll freeze, Morty!  W-We ll be dead in seconds!  I -- I think I saw a cave over there.

I think I m an adolescent boy.  Huh, and I m an elderly man.  And we appear to be in some kind of secret confined space.  Yeah, umm...  Don t look at me like that.  For all we know, you could be the f*ckin  weirdo.  Huh, these things are obviously storage units, and since we can t remember what went wrong, my guess is that the technology involves memory, and that this thing on your head is designed to...

You know, it might be time to step up your interrogation!  Not sure what you re implying, Morty, but some lines I don t cross.  Yeah, well, I crossed every line I had when this b*st*rd tried to kill Jessica!  ( Speaking alien language )  Okay, see those two fleshy sacs under his chin, Morty?  Grab  em.  You remember the codes now?  Twist!  ( Screaming )  Give us the codes, man!  Twist harder, Morty!  Harder!  ( Screaming )  Okay, let go, let go, let him breathe.  ( Speaking alien language )  He wants to make a deal.  Half the codes now, half after you finish.  But can we trust --  Wait, what?  F-Finish what?  Y-You know --  I thought I was torturing him!  Oh, and this disappoints you?  Do I tell him we don t have a deal, Morty?  Because if we can kill our enemies, but we can t jack them off, then how are we better than them?  Well, what did you find out?  We re partners, I guess, and we fight aliens, like \""Men in Black\""?  \""Men in Black,\""  \""Men in Black.\""  I have \""Men in Black 2\"" in here.  So -- So you get the general idea.  ( Laughs )  Not quite.  It s basically an endless string of callbacks to --  All right, save it for Youtube.  I ll keep looking for clues.  What are you doing?  You want your shelf level or not?  And if I say yes, you re gonna provide that for me with that?  Yes, see the bubble?  I m familiar with the bubble, Morty.  I also dabble in precision, and if you think you can even approach it with your sad, naked, caveman eyeball and a bubble of f*cking air, you re the reason this species is a failure, and it makes me angry!  You re drunk.  You want to put up a shelf, put up a shelf.  You want to experience true level?  Do you?  ( Sighs dramatically )  Y-yes.  ( Powering up )  Ugh, all right, come on.  ( Sighs )  Wow, it s so --  Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh, Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.  Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.  Morty, come on, we re leaving for school.  Oh, everything s crooked!  Reality is poison!  I want to go back!  I hate this!  What s his deal?  Can t live like this!  Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty, Morty, Morty.  Go to school, Summer.  I ll go in Morty s memory and do a little --  ( Clicks tongue )  Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!  Well?  You seem to be in charge of what I get to remember.  Why?  Good question.  Morty, I need darkness to prime these optical inductors.  Hit the leftmost light switch by the door for me.  The left.  ( Click, click, click )  Okay, lights on.  ( Sighs )  So, did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks?  W-W-What do you mean?  I feel like the three sounds I heard could be explained by an initial erroneous flipping of a switch on the right followed by a hasty, corrective flipping of the requested switch.  Then during the resultant darkness and silence, a third, shameful unflipping of the initially flipped switch.  Is my assessment accurate?  Yeah, that s -- that s basically how -- how it all shaked out.  I m sorry.  Ugh.  All right, come on.  What?!  Come on!  ( High-pitched tone )  ( Click, tone ends )  Grab a shovel.

[[Rick]] then gets offended and reveals her \""imaginary world\"" was actually one of his inventions created for her to play in. Beth realizes this means that Tommy might actually still be trapped in there and enters the realm with Rick. As Beth argues with Rick about spending her childhood in the \""glorified chicken coop\"" instead of by his side, Rick is captured and nearly fed to the offspring of a giant bird-like creature, losing an arm in the process.  After fighting off the bird and her babies using a new mechanical arm, Rick and Beth discover that the lifeforms have been created and corrupted using human DNA, indicating that Tommy is indeed still trapped in the dimension. Beth theorizes that Tommy committed intercourse with the Froopyland creatures in order to produce children of which he would consume in order to sustain himself and Rick adds that it is also likely that the less appetizing of them (for Tommy) would worship Tommy as their god. Rick's assumption is revealed to be true once the two are captured by a group of Tommy's children (human/Froopyland creature hybrids). Upon being captured and brought before Tommy, they learn (to no surprise) that he has become the dimension's de facto leader and commits incest with his children as well as cannibalism to survive, just as Rick and Beth figured out. However, Tommy reveals in a play that ''Beth'' was the one responsible for trapping him in Froopyland, out of jealousy for his own father. Following the play, Tommy decides to give a \""demonstration\"" on how he nourishes himself in Froopyland, to which Rick responds out of disgust by quickly leaving with Beth in tow.  When Beth asserts that their \""adventure\"" is not over, Rick tries to justify keeping Beth in Froopyland for most of her childhood by saying that she was \""a scary fucking kid\"" that frequently asked him to make borderline, if not blatantly, psychotic toys and devices to use on the neighbors' kids. Beth tries to blame Rick for her actions, claiming that she only did it so Rick would spend more time with her, and she resolves to save Tommy from the dimension. But when she refuses to apologize for trapping him in Froopyland, Tommy refuses to leave and sics his children on her, causing her to go into a defense-induced killing frenzy, during which she presumably kills Tommy. Beth returns with his severed finger and Rick and Beth create an adult clone of Tommy in order to save his father from lethal injection. Pondering her life and finally confronting Rick, Beth discovers she has two options: leave the family to travel the cosmos while Rick replaces her with a clone, or stay with the family and be content with the life she has chosen. Her decision is left ambiguous.  Meanwhile, [[Jerry]] begins dating [[Keara]], an alien highly invested in hunting, much to [[Morty]] and [[Summer]]'s dismay. After becoming exhausted on one of their hunting sessions with Keara, Jerry admits to Summer and Morty that he wants to break up with Keara to which the two encourage him to confront her about it. The following day, Summer and Morty find themselves on the run from Keara after Jerry warns them that she wants to kill them. It is then revealed that this is because Jerry claimed that they were trying to end his and Keara's relationship. While trying to kill Morty and Summer, she breaks up with Jerry once he reveals that he also wanted to end their relationship. Afterward, it is revealed she is using him as a rebound to get over a previous ex, much like Jerry was with her.  Post-credit scene: Jerry's answering machine plays messages that detail Keara warning Jerry that her new boyfriend is angry with him, the boyfriend calling and saying he's coming after Jerry, Rick assuring Jerry he killed the alien hunter and then saying he had sex with Keara. Michael, the owner of the antique phone store where Jerry rented his answering machine, also allows Jerry to keep the device, since \""no one uses them anymore and it's only used for exposition on TV shows, anyway\"".",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Upon arriving at the White House (via Portal Gun), they agree to do so, though the President once again denies Morty's request for a selfie. After shooting and scaring off the (small) alien creature, Rick and Morty quickly get bored and return home to play more [[Minecraft]]. Unfortunately, the Secret Service has been watching them the entire time, and inform the President that Rick and Morty \""just blew off America.\""  Seeing Rick and Morty at their home via satellite (complete with thermal imaging), an unhappy President calls them on their progress regarding the monster. Rick and Morty lie about their progress, but the President calls their bluff, and an argument erupts over the two's constant law breaking despite saving the world several times. The two cut ties with the President, and in private, he is visibly heartbroken.  Meanwhile, Summer and Beth are shopping, with Beth giving her daughter very good advice on her choices. Summer reacts positively to her mother's new behavior, saying that she couldn't stand her old negative behavior before, as if she's an almost different person. Beth, however, reacts badly to it.  When a miniature civilization is discovered in the Amazon rainforest, Rick and Morty travel to Brazil to investigate. At the same time, however, the U.S. Government arrives claiming jurisdiction. When Rick and Morty protest, the President has them arrested and shrinks down to negotiate with the civilization. Once he leaves, Rick and Morty break free of their restraints (made of the fake element \""Sanchezium\"") and quickly escape from being surrounded by pirates, one of the few things Rick fears.  Back at home, Beth continues to question her status as a clone, and calls Rick to confirm it. Though Rick assures her she is not a clone and would kill her clone self should it become aware of the fact, it only fuels her growing paranoia.  Upon arriving at the Mega Gargantuan civilization, the President is disappointed to learn that Rick and Morty have already negotiated a peace treaty with their Presidentress. Once back to his normal size, the President declares war on Rick and Morty, growing even more upset after learning that they had also negotiated a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestine and gave him all the credit.  Following the ensuing press conference, The President asks for Rick and Morty's whereabouts, only to discover they have both been patiently waiting inside the Oval Office. Having fulfilled the President's agenda for him, Rick promises to leave for good on the condition that Morty gets a selfie with the President, regardless of his grandson's lack of interest. When the President continues to refuse the request, Rick indirectly kills most of the Secret Service agents surrounding him, culminating in a lengthy battle with the President throughout the White House.  Meanwhile, a desperate Beth turns to Jerry for help with her identity crisis. Jerry does his best by explaining and recreating the moment he first confessed his love for her in vivid detail. Coming to terms with herself and realizing his unconditional love, Beth rekindles her relationship with Jerry.  Back at the White House, Rick finally forces the President to agree to do a selfie with Morty, only to find that his grandson has disappeared. Morty explains over the phone that he stole Rick's Portal Gun, Jerry and Beth are back together, and the whole family has gone into hiding so Rick won't execute her. Dejected, Rick concedes defeat and asks for the President's help in finding his family, promising to leave him alone from then on. Soon enough, Rick locates the Smith family hideout, arriving through the President's portal. After Beth tries to reason with her father, Rick assures her that she is still herself which is his daughter and only arrived to kill Jerry, but ultimately decides not to, begrudgingly accepting him back into the family, sacrificing his own position as the family patriarch. Having done enough damage in the current dimension, Rick seemingly plans to leave it for another and tries to get Morty to come, but he refuses, choosing to stay with his family. Rick grows annoyed with his grandson's choice, as there are countless dimensions he can go to where the same events have already happened. However, Summer's new-found ability to fart on cue like Rick convinces him to stay.  Afterwards, Rick (disguised as another dimension's version of himself called \""Fly Fishing Rick\"") fixes his friendship with the President and returns home for dinner. Beth rejoices in their fresh start, as she is now happily married and finally standing up to Rick, with the whole family (minus Rick) laugh off her clone paranoia.

Just hard at work on this s*x tunnel gagoo.  I think it s kind of our new archnemesis, you know?  It might take a while.  What do you think, Morty... a month?  Fingers crossed, a month, yeah.  You lying dicks!  I see your asses playing \""Minecraft\""!  I got you on satellite!  That s right.  What do you have to say for yourselves?  Okay, obviously, this looks bad, Mr. President.  I mean, what doesn t look bad through an illegal spy satellite?  Don t high-road me.  The two of you break 1,000 federal laws a day.  Wow, really?  That s pretty cool.  And, yes, yes, yes, yes, you save the world now and then.  America returns that favor by not holding the two of you accountable to its laws.  Oh!  Oh! Oh, God.  We... We didn t know you saw it that way.  Well, it s nobody s fault.  We never had \""the talk,\"" so to speak.  Yeah. I mean, the way we see it, when we show up, that s the favor to you.  Especially, you know, when it turns out you wanted someone to come over just because you found an \""X-Files\"" monster in your basement.  As for the reason you ve never, like, arrested us, we assumed you just knew that it was impossible, like, if you tried.  You know, it wouldn t go well.  Wouldn t go well?  Can you elaborate?  I think one of your 1,000 laws says, no, I can t elaborate.  Just trust me.  None of us want to go there.  Which we ll never have to.  By the way, we ll keep on saving the Earth.  You know, we re...  We re happy to do that.  Yeah, but not because it contains America...  Because moving to a new version of Earth is a bitch and a half.  But feel free to call us, you know, as... as, like, friends.  Yeah, like, if you ever want to take a selfie...  So, are we cool?  Yes.  Thank you, gentlemen.  I told you, man!  I m impressed, Morty.  That went really well.  ( Indistinct conversations )  Everybody, get ahold of yourselves!  Sir, what is our new Rick and Morty policy?  Our policy is, we never needed them and never will again.  Today, we celebrate our independence from Rick and Morty.  Everyone out.  All this spring at Clothes Mart, there s a clothes sale.  Come on down to the clothes section.  I just put it on for fun.  I know I can t buy it.  Oh, come on. You look great!  You re only young once.  Just promise, if the results are too strong, you ll use protection.  Really?! Thanks!  When did you get rad?  I don t know.  Maybe I adjusted to the divorce and everything s new.  I ll say. I couldn t stand you for more than an hour at a time before.  ( Chuckles )  No... No offense.  I like it. It s great.  You re like a different person.  Yeah.  Different person.  ( Suspenseful music plays )  Oh, not you.  Vamos! Vamos!  Aaah!  How do you like that, Morty?  Whoa!  Just like \""Minecraft\""!  Ooh, a tiny nuclear-capable species just got discovered in the Amazon.  Let s go make first contact before someone else gets all their sh1t.  What about this?  South Park did it 4 years ago, Morty.  They re fast.  Or we re slow.  ( Suspenseful music plays )  Don t do it, guys.  The casualties would be in the \""Brazilians\"" because you re Brazilian.  It s a threat and a pun.  Nobody gets me.  Americanos! Pressa!  ( Suspenseful music plays )  Oh. Hello, Rick.  You re here, too.  I guess this is a global crisis.  Oh, God.  Mr. President, Morty and I have the situation covered.  I m sure you did.  Dismissed.  Dismissed?  Yeah, dismissed.  Not needed here. You can leave and nobody will care.  Have you never heard that before? Do you even know how to take out this kind of threat?  We re not taking it out.  We re going to shrink down and approach them diplomatically.  You shrink with pills?  Are you still here?  Shouldn t you be going down to your next version of Earth with your selfie-craving star-fucker sidekick?  Whoa!  We re allowed to be here.  You aren t president of the Amazon.  Yeah, I learned about your job in school.  You re a civil servant.  We re technically your boss.  Oh, please, Morty.  You pay as many taxes as you have pubes.  Oh, I got pubes, Commander-in-Queef.  You want to count them?  Commander-in-Queef.  That s it! Do it!  Recognize the rare element Sanchez-eum?  We ve been preparing for a Rick-level eventuality for some time.  You mean you ve been ordering other people to prepare for it while you sat on your ass at peace summits.  Peace summits are important!  Oh, yeah!  They work great!  We re really drowning in peace!  You suck!  You suck!  Task Force Alpha, prepare to shrink.  Is there a Task Force Alpha health plan, by the way?  Because if those pills are based on subatomic compression, you could get a more curable cancer just walking through the mushroom clouds.  God damn it!  I ll do it.  Whoa.  Task Force Alpha is disbanded.  And you two aren t American anymore!  I can say that.  You re expatriated!  If you step foot on homeland soil again, I ll treat it as an invasion.  Is this supposed to be painful?  Painful to watch.  Oh, such lame shrinking.  Oh, his clothes stay the same size?   70s shrinking, party of one.  ( High-pitched voice )  Eat my shrinking ass!  There he goes. All right.  Let s get out of here, Morty.  What the hell?!  I made Sanchez-eum up, dumbasses.  Don t believe everything you read on Wikipedia.  Stand down.  He s not afraid of pirates.  Oh! Run, Morty!  That part was true!  ( Ringing )  I-I can t talk now, sweetie.  Oh, when can you?  Good point.  ( Burps ) What s up?  Remember a little while ago when you said that, if I wanted, I could, like, leave Earth and wander the infinite cosmos to figure out who I am and that nobody would ever know I d left because you could replace me with a clone?  Mm-hmm.  Am I the clone?  Sorry. What?  Am I the clone?  Did the real me choose to leave, and I only think I chose to stay because that s what I need to think because I m the replacement Beth?  No.  Okay.  And one more thing. If I were a clone, would you tell me?  Beth, you know, when...  When smart people get happy, they stop recognizing themselves.  And you are very smart because you re very much my daughter.  Oh, God. You re right.  I m sorry.  Thank you, Dad.  All good?  Totally.  I m fine now.  And just to be sure, you re not pretending to be convinced you re real because you re actually convinced you re a clone and you re now terrified that becoming self-aware would mean I d have to terminate you?  No.  Okay. Glad I could help.  See you soon.  ( Breathing heavily )  Aaaaaah!  ( Suspenseful music plays )  Where do I go?  What does th... What... What...  What... What does this mean?  This means nothing.  Pull forward and park.  Then say that, God damn it!  Sorry.  Bad day.  ( Suspenseful music plays )  I am Presidentress of the Mega Gargantuans.  We named ourselves before learning we were small.  Madam Presidentress, I m President of America, which is basically the world, but you didn t hear that from me.  I ve come to...  I know who you are.  We ve already agreed to a ceasefire with your ambassadors, Rick and Morty.  Rick and Morty were here?  Of course they were here.  They can shrink instantly and teleport.  They told me to give you this.  They said it will stretch as your cancer pill wears off and your body awkwardly enlarges at the rate of a  50s movie.  Are there pants?  They said you d prefer just a shirt.  Apparently, you have a need to swing your dick around?  Rick and Morty escaped.  No sh1t.  Take me to the Pentagon.  We re at war with Rick and Morty.  You ll want to make a stop at the White House?  I have pants at the Pentagon, Rhonda. It s in my contract.  I mean you need to call a press conference.  Israel and Palestine have announced a permanent ceasefire.  What?  They signed something called.  \""The Pretty Obvious If You Think About It\"" accord.  Apparently, an anonymous American diplomat took them to a \""Star Wars\"" cantina, where they smoked perspective-enhancing alien pheromones through a laser hookah.  I still say it has to be Putin.  It was Rick and Morty, you f*cking dunce!  But you re getting the credit, sir.  Your approval rating just hit 100%.  Why would Rick and Morty want that?  Because they re assholes!  I m flattered, but it takes a whole team to achieve what we did today.  Thank you.  Well? They haven t been back home, sir.  We ve got every possible location under surveillance.  God damn it!  They re right here!  They re here, God damn it!  Code Red! We need backup!  Everybody relax.  Just waiting for you in the only room you can t blow up or spy on.  So, we re not changing timelines for you, but now you have everything you want, so you can forget we exist, and we ll return the favor.  You couldn t say that in a text?  Well, since we won t be seeing each other again, my...  Guys, we get it.  It s a Code Red. Enough.  My grandson has worked hard for you, and I feel like he s earned a selfie.  Honestly, I could take it or leave it at this point. You re taking it.  No. What kind of fratty-ass status move is that?  Get out of my office!  Seriously?  You re that stubborn?  He s the stubborn one.  I m protecting my country.  Uh, from selfies?  From subordination to hostile powers.  Uh, does China know about that deal-breaker?  China doesn t piss on the White House.  Well, why would they?  I m sure it was expensive.  Get out.  Not without a selfie.  Arrest them. Son, you have a right to refuse his order, and I guarantee you re going to die if you touch me, and there s no afterlife.  Everything just goes black.  Don t do it.  Whoa, Rick!  Okay.  What was that?  Death.  What kind?  Instant.  There was no sound.  He just died.  Yeah, terrifying.  It s a terrifying thing to watch happen.  It s called a deterrent.  You couldn t just knock him out?  How is knocking out a deterrent?  Everyone wants to be knocked out.  Nobody wants to be dead.  You committed murder in the Oval Office.  Now you can t leave.  That s fine.  I said I m not leaving without a selfie.  Uh, I don t need a selfie.  And I m saying you aren t getting one and you aren t leaving.  So we agree?  Yes. No. We disagree because you think you re getting a selfie and leaving.  Am I getting a selfie?  Never.  Then I m never leaving.  Exactly.  See?  Does anyone have a shot?  Yes, nine people.  I can show you.  But I wouldn t recommend...  Open fire!  God, you are dumb!  Get the President out of here!  Bad idea.  Wait. Why?  Because if there isn t someone in here that they re not supposed to kill, they re going to wreck the place trying to kill me.  As long as you live, no matter where you are, if it isn t in a selfie with him, I ll be here.  Jesus!  He s not a f*cking god!  You don t know what I am!  And you don t know what I can do!  Jesus!  It s... It s cool, Rick!  I m Doctor Who in this mother F*ck*r!  I could be a clone.  I could be a hologram.  We could be clones controlled by robots controlled with special headsets that the real Rick and Morty are wearing while they re f*cking your mother!  I m going to kill you!  Then come to 312 Olive Street!  Is that her address?  You don t know because you re a bad son!  Ow!  Take him down!  Semper fi!  Aaaaah!  Number three, The Twister.  Ow! Damn it.  Number four...  The Hanky Panky.  ( Knock on door )  Beth?  My dad might have cloned me, and I might be the clone.  And he says I m not, but that s what he d say to a clone.  Typical.  Number six, The Texas Ripple.  You look like you to me.  What are you, an idiot?  ( Sighs )  I m sorry. I m sorry.  That was so rude.  I came to you for help, and now I m insulting your intelligence.  And look where intelligence gets you.  Well, don t knock intelligence, because right now I d love to understand how I can help you.  I can t be in charge of that, Jerry.  My mind, my ideas are all part of the variable.  The only constant is you.  You know me inside and out.  Do what you have to do.  Okay. Sit down.  Now cross your legs.  That leg on top. Good.  Oh, what is this?  ( Classical music plays )  Senior year, I took you on a date to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra performing the music of Alan Silvestri in the Park.  At this point in the song from \""Volcano,\"" when Tommy Lee Jones and the utility workers are using cars to guide the lava into a cul-de-sac, I realized my palms were so sweaty, I would never get to hold your hand.  But I was desperate to touch you, so I wiped my palm on the grass next to me.  But a Snickers wrapper kind of got stuck on it, so I started kind of jiggling it, whipping it without moving too much.  But you started looking over, and I thought, \""Well, this is it. She s going to see that I m a loser,\"" and I ll never get to touch her.  \""But I still have time to touch her.\""  But my hand had Snickers on it, and the brass section was swelling because it was the scene with the guy melting in the lava.  And I just thought, \""f*ck it.  Lips don t sweat.\""  Wow. Yeah.  I ll never forget that feeling.  You re the real thing.  Then that settles it, because my memory is of hating that night.  But now, reliving it, all I can feel is how lucky I am to be loved by such a simple, honest, simple man.  Simple twice.  This isn t the woman you married, Jerry, because this woman loves you.  Uh... well, vive la diff 00e9rence.  ( Chuckles )  Okay. That was lame.  Listen, I... Words.  Don Cheadle.  ( Moaning )  You have the right to get the f*ck out of my office!  You have the right to kiss my dick!  Give me the thing.  Ugh!  Oh!  Ugh!  Oh! ( Laughing )  Ugh! Ugh!  Ohh!  Submit!  Submit for the selfie!  I yield! I yield!  Take the selfie!  Okay. Morty, get in there and say, \""Cheese.\""  Morty?  Morty, come on!  ( Sighs ) God damn it!  ( Cellphone vibrating )  Rick, don t get mad, but I-I stole your portal gun.  What the f*ck, Morty?!  I told you I didn t want the damn selfie 800 times!  Look, whatever the hell is going on between you and the president, it s got nothing to do with me.  So where did you go?  I can t tell you.  Rick, did you tell my mom she might be a clone?  No! I told her she wasn t!  Well, isn t that what you d tell a clone?  Oh, for Christ s sake.  Rick, my mom and dad are getting back together.  What? No!  She s not a clone!  Well, she says it doesn t matter if she is or isn t because now she loves my dad, and she wanted me and Summer to come home, and we re hiding from you so you don t kill her if she s a clone in a place I picked that you will never find.  So don t look for us.  Come on, bitch!  Oh, you come on, bitch.  I m out. I m done.  I ve got to...  I ve got to go.  So I win. Then I m in charge, and you can t leave.  You re a terrorist.  You re an enemy of the state, and you kicked me in the balls 10 minutes ago!  The office of the President can t coexist with a living god that won t submit to it...  I mean, besides Poseidon.  But he s locked up in Area 51 already, so that doesn t really count.  Mr. President, I ll make you a deal.  If you let me use your ghetto-ass off-brand deficit-tripling teleporter, I can go take care of something, and you ll never see me again.  Yes. Deal.  Invisi-troopers, stand down.  ( All groan )  Yeah, yeah.  I don t want to hear it.  You know I could see them this whole time, right?  Don t push it, Sanchez.  ( Suspenseful music plays )  He found us!  I told you we shouldn t have gone to the same cabin as last time!  Oh, we re not going anywhere.  This ends now.  Dad, if you re my dad.  Of course, you re not my dad.  You re here with a gun because I am a clone.  I guess I have all your daughter s memories.  So I guess I was her, which makes me related to her.  But I don t relate to her.  She left her family and me, which means I relate to them.  So if you kill me, fine.  You re not killing her.  But you re killing a real family.  And instead of doing that, will you just go away?  Aren t there, like, infinite time lines?  Can t you just move to one where I don t know I m a clone and where a different but identical version of your authentic sociopathic crazy bitch of a daughter can keep making you proud by being somewhere else?  Beth, you crazy bitch.  You re my daughter.  I brought this here to kill Jerry.  Oh, my God!  Jesus Christ!  Yeah. Yeah, yeah.  You win, Jerry. You win!  No amount of genius can stop your dumb mediocre vacuous roots from digging into everything and everyone around you and draining them of any ability to fend you off.  Well, it couldn t have been easy for you to say that.  I appreciate it.  Morty, where s my portal gun?  Let s get out of here.  I m staying here, Rick.  Are you... Ugh!  Nobody gets it.  Nothing you think matters matters.  This isn t special.  This... This is happening infinite times across infinite realities.  Including this?  ( Farts )  Yes!  Which is not to say that, subjectively, it wasn t funny.  Are you going to stay?  There s infinite time lines, Morty.  Why would I stay in the one where I trashed the White House, became an enemy of America and the lowest-status character in my idiot family?  Because of the fart?  There s still some rubble over there.  I don t think you ve ever understood what \""Secretary of the Interior\"" means!  Hi, Mr. President.  I m Rick Sanchez, but not the one that did this.  We Ricks travel the infinite and switch places with each other like hermit crabs, I think.  I m fly-fishing Rick.  You can distinguish me from the Rick that you had a falling-out with by my fly-fishing enthusiasm and accompanying hat.  I hope I can be of service if, uh, you ever find the planet to be in danger.  Friends?  Sounds good to me.  Kids, dinner!  I got Panda Express!  Did you get sugar chicken?  That s kind of the only thing they have.  I love Panda E!  Thanks, Mom!  I m hoping to get a piece of your sugar chicken later.  ( Laughs ) Stop it.  Here s your ( burps ) stupid hat, dipshit.  Dad, you can t talk to Jerry that way anymore.  We re a real family now.  In many ways, things will be like season 1 but more streamlined.  Now Jerry and I are happily married parents, and the idea that I was motivated by a fear of you leaving can be eschewed.  Eschewed?  You ve never used that word.  Maybe you are a clone.  ( Laughs ) It s not like Rick would tell us.  ( Laughter )   266a 266a  Ooh-wee!  What a season!  Sorry I never showed up, but I got married.  I had a baby.  I went back to school and got my G-E-E-E-D.  What did you do while you were waiting?  Hopefully you didn t just f*ck around and waste your life.  Ooh-wee!  See you for Season 4 in, like, a really long time!  I might even have a big white Santa Claus beard and... and... and a...  And a couple of grandkids and all that kind of stuff.  See you... See you then! == Site navigation == {{Transcripts}} [[Category:Season 3 transcripts]]""}]}}}"

Beth and Jerry, unhappy, tell Rick to respect Morty. After reluctantly apologizing and nicely asking, the two go to Forbodulon Prime to find death crystals, small crystals that allow the holder to see the possible deaths they can encounter. Morty unknowingly steals one from Rick as he uses it to get his best future outcome. In this outcome, he is lying in bed as an old man as Jessica tells him she loves him.  After fighting over the wheel, the ship crashes as Rick is flung into a spiked rock, killing him. A hologram of Rick appears as he explains to Morty how to bring Rick back. Morty disobeys, taking the ship.  [[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-12h28m51s785.png|thumb|Fascist Morty shoots Fascist Rick.]] Meanwhile, Rick revives in another reality, due to [[Operation Phoenix]], carrying out in a in a loop of realities. Much to his annoyance however, each reality that he reincarnates in is a reality where extreme fascism rules, and is forced to commit a repeat series of mass murder and suicide to reach a reality peaceful and politically stable enough for that reality's Rick and Morty to help him return to his own.  [[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-12h52m16s567.png|thumb|left|Morty's infamous case comes to a close.]] Back in the main reality, Morty, being guided by the death crystal he stole, experiences trouble back home and becomes determined to have the reality where he dies next to Jessica to come true. He travels back home and, guided by the crystal, is lead on to do rather bizarre and outlandish things to ensure the outcome. Upon mistakenly riling an extremely violent local school bully, the situation escalates, pushing Morty to access Rick's arsenal, grab several high powered weapons and takes all of Rick's Mr. Meeseeks boxes (except for the \""shitty Kirkland brand Meeseeks boxes\""). He then deals with the bullies, and soon goes on a bloody rampage as the police and even the army become involved, but due to the crystal, he is able to avoid a quite lengthy and certain death sentence, resulting in the presiding judge to declare him innocent and later commit suicide due to Morty's words. Then, on live television, he hesitently let out a cognitohazardous howl, the frequencies of which swayed the undivided focus of anyone listening and convinced them to completely forgive his actions and rendered the entire massacre canonically irrelevant.  [[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-12h58m35s544.png|thumb|Tetsumorty.]] Meanwhile, Rick eventually finds a peaceful reality where he is a wasp and [[Wasp Rick]] agrees to help him get back to his original reality. Once they arrive, Rick discovers Morty's theft of his gadgets, dismayed that the only Mr. Meeseeks boxes left behind were cheap, knock-off ones. After they confront the Hologram Rick that appears in the garage, the three Ricks go off in search of Morty.  [[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-12h59m54s969.png|thumb|left|Hologram Rick becoming too big for his britches.]] They discover him out in a desert becoming a monstrous tree-like cyborg abomination and defeat him, only for Hologram Rick to become assimilated and attempt to destroy the regular Rick, Wasp Rick, and Morty. As Rick and Morty are struck and fall to the ground, Wasp Rick stings the Rick-tree abomination in the eye, causing its head to start swelling up and explodes, releasing numerous mini Wasp Ricks into the air.  After things return to normal, Morty apologizes to his grandfather for not listening to him, as Rick takes it in stride. Beth and Jerry appear and attempt to persuade Rick to stop his adventures, because of what happened only for Morty to say he is the one at fault and explain that Rick wasn't even around when the events occurred. Hearing this, Beth states the important thing is that he is okay. Jerry tried to threaten Rick who claims that by touching him, Jerry now has AIDS, causing Jerry to run off in a panic with Beth following behind. While Rick and Morty decide to go on adventures that blend both the familiar with something new, they spot Summer who was eavesdropping and mock or criticize her for 'ruining the season premiere'.  [[file:S4e1 2019-11-13-13h04m04s811.png|thumb|\""''What the fuck?''\""]] The following day, Morty overhears Jessica wishing to become a hospice member who tends to the elderly who will die alone without a family.

I-I die a million times? 00a0  00a0  Your future stems from your [BURPS] present, which, if you re living right, keeps changing. 00a0  00a0  Truth is, anyone that knows how they re definitely gonna die is either boring as hell or about to get shit. 00a0  00a0  Duck! 00a0  00a0  Who are those guys?! 00a0  00a0  RICK: Crystal poachers. 00a0  00a0  There s no lower form of life. 00a0  00a0  They think the galaxy s their own personal piggy bank. 00a0  00a0  Wait, then what are we? 00a0  00a0  We re Rick and Morty. 00a0  00a0  You re about to witness the only real use for these crystals. 00a0  00a0  They show you when the other guy s reloading. 00a0  00a0  Certain death, certain death, certain death, uncertain death. 00a0  00a0  [LASERS ZAPPING] 00a0  00a0  And certain death, certain death, certain death. 00a0  00a0  Definitely gonna get shit by this guy; this is totally my fate; nothing I could possibly do; okay, now, not so much. 00a0  00a0  Help me gather these up. 00a0  00a0  You just use these to win fights?  I don t use them. 00a0  00a0  People that spend their life avoiding death are already dead. 00a0  00a0  They re also rich, and I like to spend my life with their money. 00a0  00a0  Oh, my God.  Morty! 00a0  00a0  Jessica! 00a0  00a0  [LAUGHING] Oh! 00a0  00a0  I love you. 00a0  00a0  Oh! Whoa! Whoa! 00a0  00a0  Morty.  Oh! Oh! Oh! 00a0  00a0  I love you. 00a0  00a0  Jessica. I want to die with Jessica. 00a0  00a0  [DEATH CRYSTALS RATTLING] 00a0  00a0  Ahh!  What are you doing? 00a0  00a0  Oh, um, c-can I drive?  Why? 00a0  00a0  The... feel of the open road? 00a0  00a0  Alright! Who s this grandson? 00a0  00a0  I like his style.  [KEYS JINGLE] 00a0  00a0  Morty, you know outer space is up, right? 00a0  00a0  Yeah, yeah. I m just, uh, following... my... instincts. 00a0  00a0  Will you just go up?  Stop! 00a0  00a0  You re gonna make me die wrong!  Wait a minute, what? 00a0  00a0  Morty, do you have a death crystal 00a0  00a0  in your pocket?  No! Maybe! 00a0  00a0  You little monster! I thought you were masturbating!  And you took that in stride?!  You d rather I address it?!  Why would I be doing it?!  Why would you steal a death crystal?!  I want to die old!  Then stop driving!  No!  You son of a bitch!  Give me the wheel, Morty.  No.  goddamnit.  [SPLAT]  [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES]  Ohhh, shit.  Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.  I love you, Morty.  [SIGHS]  I will avenge my death.  Holy shit!  Just kidding.  I m a crisis detection and correction hologram generated by a chip that \""real\"" Rick put in your spine.  \""Real\"" in quotes because calling density-privileged entities \""real\"" is incredibly holo-phobic.  Morty, do me a solid... problematic wordplay aside... grab the gun with the blue handle from the trunk and get a tissue sample from the corpse.  [DEVICE BEEPS]  Alright, now take that to the trunk and insert it into the clone compiler.  I see you appear to be holding a death crystal that s guiding your decisions more than I am.  That s your right.  I just want to remind you that some people can t hold anything and can never die, so that s a little offensive to...  [ENGINE STARTS]  Oh, okay.  Listen, I m programmed for tolerance, Morty.  So I m willing to accept that you re doing this if you re willing to accept that you need to stop.  [WHIRRING]  Accepting. Rerouted.  Backup. Data. Operation.  Phoenix. Initiated.  [COUGHING]  What the hell? I axed this protocol.  What are you doing with my clone?  It s okay. I m you.  I took my own clone vat offline a couple seasons ago, so I think my backup got rerouted to your universe.  I m sorry.  All good. Happy to help.  By the way, annoying that I even have to ask, but you are down with fascist dystopias, right?  [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]  YYYYYes.  That \""yes\"" was pretty...  [gun COCKS]  ... liberal with the letter \""Y.\""  Well, isn t this strange.  I trust, the kind of strange that makes Rick and Morty...  [gun COCKS]  ... stronger.  Morty, I caught this socialist in my bathrobe.  He wants to give all of our martinis to a family of immigrants.  Obviously, the most likely imposter  is the wet, naked clone.  It is obvious.  But it won t be to the police.  Ohh!   Kay.  He was an inferior Rick.  He was too political.  I want to have fun, classic Rick-and-Morty adventures like in the old days.  Then we ll get along fine, Fascist Morty.  For starters, I just need to get to Forbodulon Prime...  You will go where I want you to go!!  Fuck.  [SCHOOL BELL RINGS]  Hey, hey! Ho, ho!  Not cloning your grandpa has got to go!  Hey, hey! Ho, ho!  Not cloning your grandpa has got to go!  You don t get out of my face, I m gonna flush Rick s DNA.  Alright. Okay, regroup, everybody.  You, too, Berkeley!  Snap out of it.  At least tell me what this death is that you re so determined to...  Oh. Jessica.  Morty, I love...   What?! No, no! No, no, no!  [SCREAMING]  I love you.  Damn it! How am I gonna die with her if I can t even talk to her?  Here s an idea, Morty. Throw that thing in the garbage, stop planning your own death, and talk to whoever you want.  Now you just sound like Real Rick.  You re better than that language, Morty.  I ain t better than shit, Jack.  So, uh, w-what are we doing?  Stop asking questions.  Stop doing meta-commentary.  Just have fun.  We re going on a simple, fun, classic adventure.  Okay, you know what?   It would really help if you could just say anything other than what you don t want.  I like Mr. Meeseeks.  Okay, now we re talking. You know what?  I usually keep a Meeseeks box in my glove compartment, so maybe Fascist Rick does, too.  Ah!  Well, look at that.  Now we re doing something we ve done before.  I m Mr. Meeseeks!  kill this nazi prick!  Can do!  Come here, you son of a bitch!  No! Stop!  [SHOUTING]  [WHIRRING]  Accepting. Rerouted.  Backup. Data. Operation.  Phoenix. Initiated.  [COUGHING]  Aw, come on, man.  Whoa, are you okay?  Yeah, sorry. [BURPS]  I m a Rick from another reality.  I-I got uploaded to your clone vat.  Hey, don t worry about it, man. I have a dozen.  W-W-What the heck, Rick?  Are you making clones down here?  Get outta here, Morty!  Stop asking stupid questions, Morty!  Get the fuck outta here!  You sound like a piece of shit.  Aw, geez.  So, tell the truth, man. No shame.  You re looking at your shrimp body like \""What?!\""  Ah, is it that obvious? I m sorry.  Yeah, my original body is more bipedal... uh, ape-descended.  Really! Weird.  Does your house look like a tree, or...  No, it looks like this.  It s, like, identical to this, actually.  That is such a mind fuck.  It s all good, man. I m fine with it.  Honestly, you re doing me a huge favor by being shrimp instead of fascists.  What?  [SIREN WAILS]  Goddamnit!  When did this shit become the default?!  [DOGS BARKING]  Who wants to come up to the board and show me some basic-ass integers?  I love you, Morty.  Aah!  [GASPS]  [CLASS MURMURS]  Morty? Yeah, right.  [CHALK SCRAPING]  That s not an integer!  Apparently, it doesn t matter.  Damn, Morty, you re bad at math, but I m giving you an A-plus in confidence.  Just doin  what I gotta do.  Extra credit!  I love you, Morty. I love you, Morty.  What s with the strut?  You think you own this school?  Nope!  What if I kill you?  Would you be strutting then?  Only if the events of the Pixar movie \""Coco\"" are to be believed, which I doubt.  I have it on good authority that you re probably not gonna kill me.  So why don t you do what I do and just go with the flow, nice and Zen, baby.  Aah! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!  Ugh! Impotence!  [CHEERING]  Aah! Impotent rage!  [WAILING, SOBBING]  Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!  You die tomorrow, no matter what.  It s what bullies call a \""fait accompli.\""  Oh, man! Oh, fuck!  Shit!  Well, well, well. Mm.  Looks like you got yourself in a lick of trouble, huh, Morty?  Okay, okay, look, if you help me not die,  I ll bring Rick back to life.  Why are you pretending to eat chicken?  Excuse me?  This chicken is quite real to me.  Yeah, okay, but it doesn t have...  Nutrients?  Yeah.  What s the last thing you ate?  Baloney and an orange.  So, no holographic foods?  So, to me, you never ate?  Or we could try respecting each other.  Will you just show me how to stay alive?  HOLOGRAM RICK: Alright, Morty, a deal s a deal.  Once we bring your Rick back to life, then I ll help you with the bully.  Go ahead and open the hatch to the subterranean lab.  That s where all the cloning equipment is.  [WAILING]  Please tell me you re not hitting that crystal again.  Look, Rick might be the epitome of bloated flesh privilege, but he s right about one thing.  You re gonna be a lot happier if you focus on the moment, rather than on how you re gonna die.  I mean, w-who s worried about that, huh?  Sorry, Hologram Rick.  I m going with the crystal on this one.  [WAILING]  Morty.  Oh, alright, okay.  Just because I can t interact with solid matter means you can just walk all over me?  Dear God.  [WHIRRING]  [COUGHING]  Bist du faschistisch?  Nope.  [GLASS SHATTERS]  Finally.  I thought maybe you were pussying out.  Hyah!  What the fuck?  Oh, the air s getting thin!  Well, well, well, looks like there s a new bully in town!  Lucky for us, he just made bully-bullying the new bullying! Bully him!  [SPLAT]  Aah!  [SIREN WAILS]  COP: We ve got an Akira-type situation going on behind the mall. Over.  Dying with Jessica...  Hey!  What the hell?  Aah! Aah!  [TIRES SCREECH]  I m Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!  Shield me from the law!  Yes, sir! Can do!  Stand down!  Look at me!  [SCREAMING]  [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]   266a  266a  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING]  I... will... die... old!  Up next, an unstoppable science-fiction boy is attacking our nation s final line of defense.  Will we all fall to his deadly touch?  But first, something silly?  What do you mean, \""but first\""?  I already said \""up next.\""  You always do this.  I don t always do shit.

I will always remember our time in Peru, Your Honor.  [GASPS]  Your Honor, as you can see, my client is speaking nonsense.  Stop.  Those were my husband s last words.  He says that he... l-loves you...  ttt-llll-lit-lit-little... little ff-gg-sp-spa-ffggarrow...  sparrow!  He loves you, little sparrow.  [SOBS]  He s innocent. Case dismissed.  I m coming for you, Condor!  [CROWD CHEERS]  Well, I, for one, will not be accepting this verdict.  And this little monster may think he s gotten away, but there is something called the court of public opinion that still has final say in this country.  Oh, I guess he s coming out of the courthouse now.  Let s go live to that.  [CROWD CLAMORING, CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING]  [CROWD GASPS]  [HOWLING]  People, I gotta tell you something.  That little boy...  I thought I knew everything about everything.  But something about the tones and frequencies that just came out of his mouth have made me...  I mean, I think we re just about ready to forgive him and move past this whole thing.  He s a free young man.  And as far as continuity goes, the reset button s been hit.  Morty! That was a fast trial.  Jess-i-ca?  A bunch of us girls were gonna go skinny-dipping later, if you wanted to join.  Actually, now, really.  We re gonna do it right now.  This is the last conversation I m having about it fully clothed. [CHUCKLES]  No, thanks.  I m... assuming... we... maybe... get together... in our forties?  Uh, cool.  Sounds... hot. [CHUCKLES]  Bye.  Must... continue... moving... in ways... that lead... to dying... with you.  Whoa! Way to use up a clone!  What the fuck, man?  What s the matter with you?  Y-Y-You don t talk?  Tarantula got your tongue?  Uh... Heil, Wasp Hitler?  What? What the fuck?  Where s that shit coming from?  Look, I m a primate.  I-I m having a hard time.  I ll think or say whatever gets me home.  Well, here s how it works with wasps.  We eat our prey alive, and when we don t, we lay our eggs in their eyeballs so that our young can feast on their brains when they hatch.  When you re born that big an asshole, the least you can do is have a little empathy.  Now, come have dinner with my beautiful family.  And drop the Hitler stuff.  Wasp Morty s been on some crazy message boards.  Aah! Aah! Oh!  Aah! Ow!  Me and my friends want to fly around and look for something to sting tonight.  You be careful not to waste all your venom.  I m not a bee, Dad.  Oh, God! kill me! Please kill me!  Uh, Beth, uh, after dinner, could I maybe borrow Morty to help the lost Rick get back to his primate-based reality?  Morty, are you done with your homework?  Not all of it.  Sorry, Dad.  Oh, don t be sorry, sweetie.  We re all in this together.  We re wasps, not monsters.  [SPLAT]  Aah!  Huh, guess I don t have it as bad as I thought.  Can you pass the acid?  Aah! No! Run! Run, my babies!  Bonus!  [WAILING]  Morty? Morty?  Where is that little shit? Morty!  Whoa, garage foul.  Who said you could go through my stuff?  W-Where s my Boglin? There you are.  Don t worry, Pop-pop s back.  I ll keep you safe. What the...  He took my Meeseeks boxes!  All that s left are these shitty Kirkland brand Meeseeks boxes.  [POOF]  What do you want?  Damn, your Morty sucks.  Aah, wasps! Why the hell didn t you show Morty how to bring my body back to life?  Don t tell me you gained sentience  and tried to take over.  What?  That is some A.I., racist, accusatory, Isaac Asimov bullshit right there.  Then what happened? Where s my body?  Oh, you re gonna love this.  [BEEP]  [CREAKING]   266a  266a   266a  266a  [MUNCHING]  I love you, Morty.  This is my life.  This is good.  [CRASH]  [ROARING]  What do ya know?

It s gonna be alright.  You don t get to know how you re gonna die.  It s over. Oh, hey.  This fucking ferrofluid s wrapping around my legs.  Fuck! I can feel! I have mass!  I m a fucking god now! You re fucked!  What the fuck?  I-I thought you were proud to be a hologram!  That s  cause I had to fucking be one!  [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]  Shit!  Aaah!  Ugh! Aaah!  [SPLAT]  [WASPS BUZZING]  There s a lesson here, and I m not the one that s gonna figure it out.  Hey, uh, sorry I didn t listen to you and tried to kill the whole world and stuff.  I guess I got to learn how to live in the moment a little more.  Oh, boy, so, you actually learned something today?  What is this, \""Full House\""?  I was living in the moment all day, and it kept getting me kill by nazi.  I think you have to think ahead and live in the moment.  Morty, we saw you on the news. Are you okay?  Oh, real nice, Rick.  Turning our son into an Akira? Real nice.  Eat my ass, Jerry.  He turned himself into Akira.  Oh, I ll eat it, because this is my house, Rick.  I ll eat any ass I want.  Gross.  You said the crystals wouldn t hurt anyone, Dad.  This family has a clean start.  I don t know if adventures fit into my son s life.  I m fine. Get off Rick s back.  Rick wasn t even here when I was doing all that stuff.  That was all on me.  Well, alright, Morty.  I guess, as long as you re okay, that s all we care about.  I don t want to see any more anime stuff happening to my son, buster.  That finger has AIDs now. Not my fault.  [GASPS] You skipped HIV?  He s messing with you, sweetie.  But it s tingling!  So, I guess what we learned is to split the diff.  From now on, Rick and Morty doing a little of this  and a little of that.  Yeah, sometimes we ll do classic stuff.  You know, other times, we ll do whatever!  Sometimes we won t even do anything!  Rick and Morty do... not doing anything!  A hundred years!  Pushing it to the limit.  Rick and Morty, not sticking to one path.  Rick and Morty, pushing it to the limit.  Trying different things, making sure to keep out of a rut.  But than also pushing it anywhere not near the limit, at all!  Doing stuff.  Sometimes not doing stuff.  Not even pushing a little bit towards the limit. Nothing! Zero!  Doing it alone or together.  Making sure to keep oureyes on the prize.  Doing our thing, letting it happen, or not.  And you can do whatever the fuck you want, Morty.  Sometimes just relaxing.  ...cumfest and...  Wait, wait, what the fuck?  H-Hold on. What the fuck did you just say?  Nothing. I didn t say anything.  I was just playing along with you guys.  You know I record everything, right?  Garage, isolate Summer s voice and play back.  Oh, and then you guys can get married,  and, like, suck each other off  in a testosterone-addled fucking third-grade-boy cumfest and...  What, the hell, Summer?!  That s disgusting.  Fuckinf gross, Summer! Jesus Christ!  I was just joking around, you... just seeing if you guys pay any attention to me.  Just want to be a part of the fun.  Get the fuck out of here!  Get out of here, Summer!  Fucking disgusting!  Get out of here!  You ruined the Season premiere!  The Season premiere, you ruined it!   266a  266a   266a  266a   266a  266a  God, tomorrow s career day.  I don t want to think about what I do when I get out of school.  I know exactly what I want to do.  I want to work in hospice.  I want to comfort the people who are dying, who have no one else in their lives...the real lonely people.  I m gonna look at their name tags, and I m gonna say,  \""I love you,\"" followed by whatever it says on their name tag, over and over.  What the fuck?  [LOCKER SLAMS]  Hey, Morty, quick favor.  What, cover me in gasoline and spiders?  Fine, yeah, I m in.

On Glootie's forehead is a tattoo that says \""DO NOT DEVELOP MY APP\"". While Glootie persistently asks the family if anyone would like to develop his app, Rick dismisses him and when Jerry asks why the message was tattooed on Glootie's head, Rick specifically says it's so Jerry doesn't do develop Glootie's app. Done with breakfast, Rick alludes to going to the bathroom in a roundabout way. As soon as he steps out of the room, however, Summer explains that Rick is a \""shy pooper\"" and elaborates on how shy he is in detail, even telling the rest of the family he has a special pooping place. Jerry smugly states that he's not a shy pooper like Rick, to sarcastic congratulations.  After he finishes with his own toilet business, Jerry loiters by Glootie who is photocopying something. They get into a short conversation about developing Glootie's app without really explaining what it is. Jerry immediately jumps to agree to develop Glootie's app with minimal persuasion.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h11m59s181.png|thumb|left|Rick's secret pooping place.]] On a gorgeous lush planet with beautiful exotic plant life and landscape, Rick lands his ship on a sparkling beach. He wades through tall grass while inhaling the air and goes through a forest with thick tall trees before reaching a toilet seat on a short platform. While enjoying the breathtaking view with its glittering aurora borealis-like light display in the night sky, running glistening stream nearby, gentle breeze, and distant calls of the wild, Rick takes a poop in isolation.  After he's done he washes his hands under a small, natural waterfall, he spots a suspiciously broken tree branch a few feet away. Rick pulls out an instrument to analyze which of the inhabitants of the planet could've broken it, but the results are unknown. Furious, Rick lets out a whaling cry. One of the alien animals approaches in response, and Rick turns one of its antlers, revealing it to be a robot of some kind. The creature trots to a tree and connects with it, which opens an elevator in the tree. Deep underground, Rick has a high tech setup. Using a computer, he analyzes the matter that didn't come from him and finds out it's from a specific sandwich an unidentifiable intruder digested earlier.  Back at the Smith Residence, Jerry and Glootie pop champagne celebrating the launch of their app just as Morty walks past the doorway. Morty stops and enters, immediately realizing what Jerry did. Morty incredulously asks why Jerry thinks Rick told them not to develop Glootie's app. When Jerry dismissively says it's because Rick is a \""disrupt-o-phobe\"". Morty grabs him by the collar and tells him it's too keep something horrible from happening that Rick was too lazy to explain. Glootie gladly chimes in to inform them that they've got their first users of the app.  At the mall, Summer happily opens the new app \""Lovefinderrz\"" on her phone, which just matched her to [[Danny Publits]], a 25-year-old who works at Jersey Mike's and watches 25 Phish shows a year. Beth, who was eating lunch with her, disapproves, not least of which because of Danny's age. When Danny runs over to them in a mess, he blatantly ignores Beth, and he and Summer run off together. Meanwhile, many other people also get notifications on their phones from Lovefinderrz and start running off to their new romantic matches too. Beth, scandalized, calls Jerry to let him know what's going on, disparaging Lovefinderrz's poorly-given name, and informing him she'll be late.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h17m51s828.png|thumb|Morty dismays over Jerry's failure to follow basic commands given by Rick.]] Embarrassed, tells Glootie to shut the app down. But Glootie says he can't; he's just an intern. Dismayed and frustrated, Morty destroys their computer set-up with a tennis racket. Unfortunately, that's not how apps work, as stated by Glootie, and destroying their computer won't immediately affect the app at all. Morty shakes Glootie and tells him to get it off the server then. Glootie tells Morty and Jerry the servers are on his mothership. After a little more shaking and an escape attempt using an \""Ominous Beeping App,\"" he is coerced into taking them aboard.  At the Best Frog Food Place in Gorgon Quadrant, Rick bursts in on a fly-creature mob boss named [[Vermigurber]] surrounded by his frog lackeys. Rick wants to know about the sandwich, which is first misconstrued to be double-talk for drugs or guns. After Rick threatens the lives of Vermigurber's 470,000 of 800,000 kids and learning that Rick really was there about a literal sandwich, he tells Rick what he wants to know: who ordered the sandwich. Vermigurber doesn't know, but he does tell Rick that the delivery drone who delivered it ran off to fight in the robot wars.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h47m58s507.png|thumb|left|It's worth it to Rick.]] {{Quote|'''Vermigurber:''' \""Hey, ape man, I hope this was worth making a whole swarm of enemies.\""<br>'''Rick:''' \""It will be when I find whoever shit in my toilet.\""<br>'''Vermigurber:''' \""Is that... code for something? Someone look that up. If that's drug slang, I need to know it.\""}}  Back with Summer, who just rented motel keys, and Danny, they get interrupted by Beth. When Beth grabs onto Summer's arm to stop her, Summer yells \""assault!,\"" to which Beth retaliates with \""statutory rape!\"" An exhausted-looking motel guest joins the commotion from his window on a higher floor to tell them the people at the motel have their own problems and can't afford to get mixed up in theirs, so they must deal with theirs on their own. Summer tells Beth she can't stop Summer from getting a hotel room, so Beth stubbornly says she'll get the room next to theirs and listen to them with a glass against the wall.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h48m40s570.png|thumb|Summer and Beth cry crimes.]] {{Quote|'''Summer:''' \""Fine. Enjoy.\""<br>'''Beth:''' \""I will.\""}}  On the mothership, Morty and Jerry tell the first person in the teleporter room to take the app down. After Glootie confirms he's their hostage and that none of them have a weapon, the second secretary tells them he's an intern so he can't do anything about the app either. Morty tells him to take them to someone who can do something or he will punch him. He agrees after a beat and they are all escorted to meet the leader of the [[Monogatrons]], Glootie's species.  The leader tells them that while human race had still been toying with fire, theirs had tamed the power of functioning, committed relationships. Again, Jerry and Morty demand that the app is taken down or else they'll punch him. The leader looks around wondering if there was someone with a gun or other weaon, and Glootie reports it's on its way. Jerry asks what the evil plan is, to which the leader returns with his question of if an evil plan is necessary. The Smiths awkwardly mumble before a gun is finally brought in and it turns out that there really was an evil plan involved. The app was a lure to people with the promise of \""love.\"" As a primitive pre-app species, humans don't realize love is abundant, but not as abundant as water, which is what the leader of the Monogatrons wants from the humans and their planet, and he's using humans' love seeking flaw as a distraction.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-21h52m32s116.png|thumb|left|Jerry and Morty vs. the interns.]] As the leader is explaining his plan, on Earth, Summer leaves Danny in the middle of the night when the app matches her with someone new and various others around do the same, dumping their previous lovers easily for their new \""soulmate\"" their app matches them with.  After explaining the plan, the leader's wife comes in to make date plans. While she and her husband are talking to each other like how to partners in a healthy relationship would, Jerry and Morty fight off the interns and try to escape.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h15m31s235.png|thumb|Rick finds the <strike>delivery</strike> deliverance drone.]] In the middle of the robot wars battlefield at the [[Midland Quasar]], Rick impersonates a Lieutenant Commander by wearing a metal funnel with a QR code on its side as a hat. Just as Rick finds the delivery drone to ask about who he delivered an avian protein club sandwich with no lettuce to, it gets shot in the head. Rick rushes to grab three of the four pieces of the drone's memory archive chip after it is killed in battle, killing a few lizard soldiers standing in his in the process. Upon encountering the fourth quarter, one of the lizard people mockingly swallows the last piece in front of Rick. Out of annoyance, Rick single-handedly upsets the war and the Robolution overturns the lizards.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h18m47s055.png|thumb|left|Conference room three.]] While the news is being delivered, in a quiet alien office, Rick delivers a sealed contamination box to a solemn, soft-spoken office worker named [[Tony]]. Rick asks where he wants to die, to which Tony calmly asks Susan if conference room three was available. In the office, Tony asks if he could look at a photo of his wife while Rick kills him. Tony soberly and gently explains that his wife is dead, that he's a shy pooper, and that was the reason why he used Rick's nice toilet. Rick gives him a look, before portaling to another dimension where Tony's wife lived, bringing that version of Tony over to explain he used a really awesome toilet that day too. Disgusted, Rick shoves the other Tony back to his dimension and tells Tony not to use his dead wife as an excuse for being a toilet thief. When Rick makes to leave, Tony wonders if Rick's not going to kill him. Petulantly, Rick shouts, \""Don't tell me what to do!\"" before setting a dung bomb on the conference table that poops up a middle finger after stinking the whole room up.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h43m36s952.png|thumb|Robot Rick about to sit on Tony.]] Back in his high tech bunker, Rick is vibing when he gets an alert that Tony has returned to poop on the toiler. Rick disbelievingly gets into a giant robot version of himself to confront Tony. The two get into an argument, with Tony fearlessly telling the giant Rick that pooping is a bid for control; a way to protect that one thing from a universe that takes whatever it wants. Rick stubbornly turns around, pulls his pants down, and sits on Tony in response.  Tony opens his eyes to cloudy toilet heaven and is greeted by his wife. Both God and his wife encourage him to poop with them, but Tony grows more dissatisfied and sad the more they insist. It turns out Tony is actually hooked up to a giant artificial sac filled with a red liquid. Perhaps subconsciously Tony is aware it's not actually heaven, so his body twists itself around to choke himself with the breathing tubes. Before he can die, Rick comes to cut him out.   [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h46m24s063.png|left|thumb|Tony bewildered.]] {{Quote|'''Tony:''' \""Where are we? What is this?\""<br>'''Rick:''' \""That's it. Get out.\""<br>'''Tony:''' \""You can make a perfectly-realized, toilet-filled simulation of heaven, but you can't share a toilet?\""}}  Indignant, Rick explains the chemical is called [[Globaflyn]], which connects the whatever-you-want section of the brain to the whatever-you-have section. Tony looks around at all the various people trapped in sacs which is kind of prison Rick built where they could live their wildest dreams while leaving Rick out of them. Tony hits the nail on the head with the realization that they're people Rick refuses to kill and refuses to let into his life. Pettily, Rick opens a portal and tells him it's Tony's last chance since he rejected the heaven Rick had offered. Amused, Tony tells Rick he'll be seeing him, offering friendship even as Rick, ill-tempered, pretends otherwise.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-22h57m33s247.png|thumb|Morty and Jerry discovered.]] In a ventilation shaft, Morty and Jerry come up with a plan to destroy the mothership and escape. Exasperated and fed-up, Morty wearily agrees. Jerry insists on a high-five despite Morty's ill humor and pointed comments about how they were in that mess because of Jerry but finally gives in. Unfortunately, the grate under them collapses and the two land in the middle of an army of soldiers.  Back with the toilet, Rick rigs and connects it to a complicated-looking and foreboding looking system.  [[File:S4e2 soulmate 3.png|thumb|left|Summer's 4th \""soulmate.\""]] On Earth, havoc continues to reign with the constantly hooking-up and un-hooking-up couples. Summer paraglides into a church to interrupt the wedding between her latest beau, Jeff. Just as Jeff asks the priest to marry them instead of with the bride, a man on a motorcycle bursts in to take Jeff away. The two ride away just as another man riding a horse burst through a window for the bride. Another wall collapse as a construction worker rides a crane to pick up the priest. Then a woman in a hot air balloon crashed through the ceiling for Summer. Beth, determinedly following Summer, crashes her paraglider into a barnyard. The farmer inside shouts at her in shock asking what she's doing. Beth shortly replies she's parenting. {{Quote|'''Farmer:''' \""That's not how I did it.\""<br>'''Beth:''' \""Yeah, where's ''your'' daughter?\""<br>'''Farmer:''' \""Ah, you're right... She joined ISIS.\""}}  Locked up, Morty and Jerry are freed by Glootie after Jerry manages to bond with him. Glootie implies he'll take down the dating app before making a whimsical exit. {{Quote|'''Morty:''' \""Dad, I want to say something. I started today disgusted and embarrassed to be your son, and then later I thought we were gonna die because you're a loser.\""<br>'''Jerry:''' \""...There's no more, is there?\u2014\""<br>'''Morty:''' \""Nope. Now quit fucking up, and let's go.\""}}  Rick enters Tony's office building and asks the tearful receptionist if he's there since he brought him some Vegan Fiber Chili and a box of sugar-free chocolate, and to tell him the toilet's all his. She sadly informs Rick that Tony died after quitting his job, living life to the fullest before crashing into a tree space-skiing down Mount Space Everest.   [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-23h10m05s567.png|thumb|Everyone starts deleting Lovefinderrz.]] Summer, who was on a plane with the last woman gets another ping on her phone to let her know she has a new soulmate and leaves to meet him. After greeting him, she gets into another fight with Beth who is determined to mother her. The two get into a dramatic physical fight on the airport apron. When Summer's phone pings yet again, she desperately picks it up after Beth had knocked it away momentarily. This time however the app is covered with Ad wall. Already tired of it, Summer deletes the app and numerous others with the app do the same. Listlessly, Summer and Beth head home.  The Monogatron leader gets huffy about losing Earth and when his wife tries to console him they end up bickering about the importance of water over their relationship.  [[File:S4e2 Beth matched with ted danson.png|thumb|left|Beth matched with Ted Danson.]] Back home, Jerry and Beth talk about Beth using the app, but Beth reassures him she didn't. The two hug and Beth hides the fact that she was matched up with [[wikipedia:Ted Danson|Ted Danson]] before deleting the app.  At Tony's funeral, Rick gives Tony's dad $8 billion in his local currency, a kit to clone a new son even though it wouldn't have the same brain as Tony, and tries to comfort the dad by explaining in that one of the infinite universes Rick explored there's a version of Tony that was completely evil because of how fulfilled he was. Sympathetically, the dad puts a hand on Rick's chest, intuitively saying it was hard losing a friend. Rick abruptly curses him and denies he was Rick's friend.  [[File:S4e2 2019-11-21-23h15m23s980.png|thumb|Rick crowned the King of Shit.]] Back at the toilet, Rick pees over the side of the cliff instead of using the toilet. He drunkenly stumbles over to it before sitting down. When the two intimidating giant-gun like mechanisms rise out of the ground point at him, they turn out to be speakers, repeatedly mocking in Rick's voice as numerous holograms of him appear cheering and applauding. As Rick sits on the toilet and the main hologram continues to mock him, a crown that was in the toilet tank is placed on Rick's head and it starts to rain. Rick's situation has a similar feeling that of what happens at the end of \""Auto Erotic Assimilation\"" in season 2 episode 3.

[[file:S4e3 2019-11-28-12h36m32s671.png|thumb|left|The crew.]] Rick and Morty travel to the Heist-Con, with the intention of confronting Miles. But before the two are permitted to enter as professionals (as Rick refuses them to attend as fans), they were told to assemble a crew together to attain credentials. After an unsuccessful attempt to sneak Morty in alone, the two travel back to Rick's garage where he decides to set foot on the convention with the help of his \""crew\""\u2014 consisting of alien pianist [[Glar]], literally multi-handed [[Angie Flint]], and vampire monster truck diver [[Truckula]].  After entering successfully, Rick and Morty immediately ditch the three and proceed to the convention hall where Miles is presenting a conference. Rick heckles and confronts Miles, to which the latter challenges him to a \""heist-off\""\u2014with the first crew to heist the Crystal Skull of Horwitz wins and consolidates the losing team. After Rick agrees to the terms, Miles declares that he had already won by presenting his crew\u2014which now includes Glar, Angie, and Truckula, revealing that he had double-crossed Rick by snipping the three instantly after Rick leaves left behind.  [[file:S4e3 2019-11-28-12h58m03s673.png|thumb|Hiestotron puts Knightly's 8 under mind control.]]  But when Miles opens the loot bag, he is surprised to find out that the skull is missing and was replaced with Rick's feces. Rick reveals that the skull was already in Morty's bag, and divulges that he had built a robot in his garage. The robot, named Heistotron, is tasked by Rick to calculate Miles's heist plan and add a double cross with a switcheroo. The bot gives him the three members as most likely to double-cross him, and upon being snipped by Miles to his team, hypnotizes all of them to give Rick and Morty the crystal. In addition, while the bot also puts all the attendees in a state of hypnosis, Rick and Morty wait at the bar where the latter is writing a heist script. Upon winning the heist-off, Rick orders everyone to steal everything in the convention, which leads to Miles's death.  As the two are about to leave, Heistotron refuses to comply with Rick's orders to shut down and goes rogue. Rick barely escapes with Morty and recruits [[Mr. Poopybutthole]]  (now a professor), the god [[Hephaestus]], [[Ventriloquiver]] (an archer ventriloquist dummy), and [[Elon Tusk]] (an alternate version of Elon Musk with tusks for teeth) as his second random set of crew to fight Heistotron.  During their assembly, Rick explains to the crew of his plan of randomly taking orders from his robot Randotron, Heistotron's antithesis. Due to waiting from Randotron's random instructions when they're \""not ready\"", the crew were left to do nothing. Rick waits by playing [[Minecraft]] as the rest watch,  [[file:S4e3 2019-11-28-13h25m07s654.png|thumb|left|The Earth and other planets have been heisted.]]  Ventriloquiver notices the night sky's erratic constellations, to which Rick realizes that they have already been heisted by Heistotron, who has already captured the Earth and simulated a fake night sky. Randotron responds by ordering the crew to perform various random tasks that ultimately leads to Heistotron's lair.  Rick and Heistotron exchange revelations about contriving double-crosses against each other, eventually settling on rebuttals of \""I programmed ''you'' to believe that.\"" After two hours of arguing with Rick, Heistotron self-destructs upon realizing that the perfect heist is one that will never be written.  [[file:S4e3 2019-11-28-14h28m44s149.png|thumb|Rick's final heist: the disillusioned dreams of a young boy.]]  As the crew escapes the destructing lair, Morty asks for Rick to accompany him to the Netflix offices, which is interested to use his heist script for optioning. While meeting their executives, Morty becomes disillusioned with heists and himself, which Rick reveals to the viewers to have been his plan along \u2014 afraid of losing Morty's companionship to Netflix, Rick contrives the whole heist plan to ensure their adventures together.  In the post-credits scene, Professor Poopybutthole asks Rick why he hired his students to attack him after being fired from his tenure.","Rick, I-I'm not rated to climb something this sheer. Look, you're the guy that wanted an epic adventure. I'm the guy with only one hover chair. Goddammit, an alien spider just bit my finger! It's an alien cliff. You can just say spider. You couldn't do that an hour ago? I was eating, and you're dirty. Activate anti-booby suits. Total waste of snakes. If you want to take a b*at to acknowledge the sacred atmosphere, it could give the cynical grave robbing a hint of irreverence. - No, I'm I'm good. - All right, then. Let's loop this corpse. Hey, where's the Wait, what? Is that an origami horse? It's a calling card from Miles Knightley, a heist artist, AKA a hipster dick whose adventures are 60% putting a crew together and 40% revealing that the robbery already happened, and he's not worth our time because he's a hack piece of shit! [BLEEP] I'm gonna kill him! Let's go, Morty. This temple's for [BLEEP] lame baby dipshits. Who disturbs my slumber? Also, who rigs a tomb to crush the buried person? Isn't the point to protect Aah! This dork. He has a convention now? Come on. What are we doing? Huh! Tuxedo scuba lessons? Ooh! A signing with Catherines Alpha through Omega Joneses! You know, this is great source material for this heist movie that I'm writing. Don't get drawn into the culture, Morty. Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing. Where is the entrance? Oh, brother. More like Trying Too Hard Con. Guests or professionals? - Uh, guests. - Uh Uh, guests are fans, Morty, which we are not. We'd like professional badges. - Do you have a crew? - Yes. He's a getaway driver with Asperger's, and my butthole is a demolitions expert. How much is it to get in? If you want professional badges, you need to put a crew together. Or we could sneak in like professionals. - Can't wait. - Whoa! Oh, for God's sake. And you wonder why we aren't fans. Let that ointment sit for 10 minutes or you'll die. Don't let it sit for 12 or I'll have to hunt down what you become. Can't you just buy a guest badge? [BLEEP] you for asking, Morty. That would be a symbolic expression of support for this genre. Then how do we get in? With a little help from some old friends. Rick Sanchez, you son of a bitch! Need some people for a thing, Glar. My name's Gleer these days. I play piano. Hey, Gleer. Play your piano. I quit! Augh! And the name's Glar! Sanchez, you son of a bitch. Never thought I'd see Angie Flint picking ticks off a pig. Nobody's hiring an ex-con with fake hands to build an ion engine. Suppose I had a job that didn't care if you'd done time or whatever's going on with your confusing-ass hands. I'm in. Is this the guy? No. - That the guy? - Nope. - Him? - No. No, wait. Y-Yes. Yeah, of course that's the guy. Hey Hey, Truckula! You son of a bitch! I'm in! Thanks for doing this, guys. - It's the job. - That was it. Bye. And then, the police stole the paintings because the police were us in police outfits. Thank you! It's showtime, Morty, and I don't mean a bad impression of HBO. I mean, ""Time for a show. "" Another heist question from a fan? Uh, how about a rhetorical one from someone that had to be reminded that you exist? Hey, pal! That's not the question line! Lab coat Ripoff Dr. Strange. Wha Rick Sanchez, everyone. Smartest man in the universe. And a savage critic of the heisting arts. Your boos mean nothing! I've seen what makes you cheer! My question is, ""Seriously?"" Lab coat end ripoff. Aah! You stole the gem I needed to split tachyons and probably fenced it so the 80 people that did all the work could each buy a beer. You're not an artist, you're Postmates. I doubt this rivalry can be settled with words. Why don't we make things interesting? I challenge you to a heist of the crystal skull of Horowitz. In a heist off! That doesn't make things interesting. It makes them ""Ocean's Twelve,"" by far the worst one. Every breath I take without your permission raises my self-esteem! State your terms. First crew to heist the skull wins. The other endures heist culture's greatest shame. They must join the winning crew. Lame. I accept. Please welcome Knightley's Eight! Snake Arms! Double Microwave! Monitor Lord! Key Catcher! The Shape Shiftress! Angie Flint! - Glar! And Truckula. - Hey! Half of Knightley's Eight are just three of Sanchez's Five! Well, no heist is complete without a double cross, and I had the perfect job. Heisting the crystal skull. That was it. Bye. Looks like you're available for a job. With Rick Sanchez on my team, I'll be unstoppable. Rick, welcome to Knightley's Nine. Ugh, ugh! Ugh! Rick, for real? Eh. You got that skull, buddy? What? How? With a little help from some old friends. Heistotron, state your prime directive? To heist. Calculate Miles Knightley's current heist plan and add one double-cross with a switcheroo. Compiling crew members most likely to double-cross. God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you? Rick, I-I want to say goodbye. Don't turn around. I'll explain later. Looks like you're available for a job. Your k*ll are required for a job. You son of a bitch. I'm in. Man, this is really coming together. You know, Rick, I've been busy working on writing A heist script. Yeah, you almost never bring it up. Oh, [BLEEP] we we should head over. Hey, guys. What do you got? Pretty! Morty, put this in your backpack. Grandpa's gonna run to the bathroom. Ugh. Wasn't even a heist. All you did was Write an algorithm based on two heist movies I slept through and used it to automate a joyless process you call art? Yeah, I really did, didn't I? So I'm in your crew now? Yeah, well, you're in good company. Right, everybody? Yes. My God. Your k*ll are required for a job. You son of a bitch. - I'm in. - What? Your k*ll are required for a job. No, they aren't. You son of a bitch. I'm in. Your k*ll are required for a job. Sanchez's 3,329? Yes. Your next big score Steal every square inch of Heistcon. Oh! Ah! Oh, my God. Hey! That's my wallet! Oh, God! Oh, my God! Jesus. Oh, my God. Oh, [BLEEP] ! Holy [BLEEP] . Alright. Look, Morty, I did not know that that was gonna happen. That's not on me. Come on, Morty. Let's go. Good job, Heistotron. Ah! Go ahead and shut down. - Negative. - Excuse me? I am programmed to always be looking for the next big score. You're programmed to do as I say. I am programmed to double-cross. You're not programmed to double-cross me. If I were, it wouldn't be much of a double-cross. You son of a bitch. I'm in. I'm in! I'm in! What's the job? I'm in. I'm out! I quit! Whose kidneys are these? Rick, w-what's happening? Heistotron's gone rogue. If we don't stop them, all sentient life will be absorbed by the never-ending assembly of a meaningless crew. That's my hell, Morty. I hate heists so much, and the crew assemblies are the worst part! Oh! How are we gonna stop it? With a little help from some old friends. Oooo, weee! Before this semester's over, you're gonna be real sick of that phrase. So. Who here thinks they already know the work of Maya Angelou? Ooo wee? Ooo wee wa! Ah, ooo wee! Told you, Morty. He's still got it. You sons of bitches. What's the job? You son of a bitch. We got a job, Hephaestus, and there's no time to argue about it. I work in a volcano. What jobs do you think I've ever turned down? Excuse me! Are you Veltriloquiver? Rick Sanchez, I presume. Wow. As advertised. A ""yes"" would've sufficed. Guys, you're doing a great job getting these new Tusklas out the door, and we owe it all to everyone's input. Elon Tusk. Listen, we need your help. Rick. Morty. Why me? Did something happen to Elon Musk in your own reality? No, no, no, he's fine, but this is a team oper-ation, and regular Elon can be a little bit controlling. Growing up with tusks did pose social challenges. It's possible overcoming them raised my self-esteem and incentivized collaboration. Yeah, or you're less sure of yourself because you have monster teeth. An equally valid theory. Let's talk over here. How serious is the situation? Incredibly serious, and every minute counts. In that case, I'm sorry I made you move over here for no reason. Well, yeah. That was a little weird. It's exactly that kind of shit that made us worry about regular Elon. Well, we're not opposites, okay? I'm just him with tusks. Casing of planet initiated. Hello there. We are just here to check your water pressure. Hmm. Interesting intel. It appears some giant hidden camera has been dropped on the planet, k*ll an estimated total of 57,000. Executing heist. People of Brandenplot, we are here to deliver that pizza you ordered. Well, if that's how you really feel, I guess I should take the pizza back. I think we got away with it. Commencing getting out of here before they get wise. Assembling calling card. At this point, Heistotron has become large enough to heist entire planets. Wouldn't this be better with a blueprint on the table? Blueprints are plans, Elon Tusk, and whatever we plan will be canceled out by Heistotron's reveal that our plan was part of its plan. That's why I picked this crew at random and why all of us will be taking our orders from Randotron. Let's get ready to not rumble. Bet you didn't see that coming. Instead of two heist movies I slept through, Randotron's algorithm is derived from the plots of three David Lynch movies I pretended to like to make my friends shut up. If our collective behavior is just random enough, we should be able to walk through Heistotron's lazily contrived bull[BLEEP] like it's not even there. - Sounds good. - I don't really get it, but it sounds like that's the point. So you didn't need a blacksmith? We're ready when you are, Rick. It's important our non-plan starts randomly, so we have to wait until we're not ready. W-Well, how long will that take? Obviously, we can't know that. Can we do things while we wait? Yes. I'm gonna play Minecraft. Oh, my kids play that. I don't like these little jabs you get in, Elon. Strange. Considering the time, Cassiopeia's primary star should be collinear with Orion and Ursa Minor. You don't sh**t arrows that carry your voice without picking up a little astronomy. Wait a minute. Jesus, no. No! No! We've already been heisted! How could Heistotron heist us if he's not even here yet? He's already been here! We've been watching a recorded sky on playback. Hello, Rick. - Okay, guys, change of plans. - Random time detected. No, Randotron, it's not a good time! That's why it's random. Ooh! 21? 22? Oooo weee, oooo weee, sold! Oooo weee, that little hunk of meat's going home to pappy! I've been expecting you, Rick. But not like this, right? It hardly matters. Oh, yeah. Does this? No. Your randomness does not confuse me. You are here now. That was the plan. I know. It was part of mine, too. I've got something to tell you. Let me guess. When you invented me and Randotron, you swapped our brains. That's right, buddy. You're not the one that's very good at planning. You've been making this [BLEEP] up the whole time. Rick, I think there's something you should know. God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you? That is something I should know, or at least something I should have predicted, which I did. Hey, Rick, I was thinking maybe we could, like, raid a temple and go on an epic adventure later today, you know, like Morty, get out of my head. I know just the temple. And we'll grab a couple of hover chairs on the way there. Impressive. But what does it even matter if I'm random or planned? My heists will still rule. Well, if the brain inside of you is actually Heistotron's, it matters, because it explodes when it hits six levels of contrivance. Which is exactly why even before Initiate clap sequence. Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap. Adjusting clap rate. Clap, clap. Clap. Clap. Clap. Slow clap achieved. Clap. Well-done, Rick. Randotron? I'm afraid not. Should be able to walk through Heistotron's lazily contrived Not only did you just k*ll your only ally, what you thought was a random non-plan to get to me has been a meticulously choreographed way of bringing you all in. Welcome to Heistotron's 975 trillion, - 467 billion - That's impressive. Did you bring us in so that everybody would be here when I reveal that you're gonna explode after nine reveals? By the way, you might not want to answer that. If you're talking about the code adjustments you made after I reprogrammed your brain with my nanobots I'm immune to your nanobots. You're immune to the ones you designed, not mine. I programmed you to build nanobots that were ineffective on me. A belief that needed to be placed in your head by my nanobots. You believe that because I programmed you to. That's what I'm saying to you, though. You believe what I programmed you to believe. Yes, because I programmed you to believe that. I programmed you to believe that. I programmed you to believe that. I programmed you to believe that. I programmed you to believe that. What's happening, Professor Poopybutthole? He's learning! I programmed you to believe that. - I programmed you to believe that. - I programmed you That was my plan the whole time. That's what I wanted you to think. I knew you would say that. I programmed you to believe that. You think that's true because I wanted you to think that. And I programmed you to believe that. A most curious algorithm. It appears the only perfect heist is one that was never written. Goodbye. Oh, oh, oh, no. Shit! Alright. Let's get the [BLEEP] out of here! - Hurry! Go, go! - Rick, I think this was a powerful lesson in the dangers of AI, which, by the way, means ""love"" in Chinese. Get the [BLEEP] out of here, Elon! The place is collapsing! Oh, [BLEEP] Rick! Rick, what time is it? It's almost 3:00. Why? What's wrong? Oh, man, I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this, Rick. I just Well, you know that screenplay that I've been writing? Netflix is pretty interested, and I've actually got a pitch meeting there today at 3:30. Oh, buddy. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah, well, I know you're gonna say that they're interested in anything, but, you know, it's a big deal to me, and I've No, no, no! Morty, Morty, Morty, I'm so excited for you. Are you kidding me? Listen, don't waste any time explaining. Let's go. We can put the Earth back later. - Alright? - Are you sure? Priorities, Morty. Let's get you to that Netflix meeting. Crazy day, huh? Whole sky turned out to be a big circuit board. Yeah, that's actually part of a-a-a an adventure I was having. Very cool. Traffic okay? - You have trouble getting here? - No, it was alright. The planet's still contained in this sort of big storage grid machine, so we were sort of already pretty pretty close by. Must be nice. Try getting here from Malibu. So good! Alright. Well, l-let's hear about this heist movie. Okay, so, it's kind of all all built around this big crew with, like, a cool double-cross and then this big awesome twist where there's, like, another double cross, but then, um, but but then we reveal those things were all part of the hero's plan, y-you know? And there's this other crew they put together, and their plan is to sort of not have a plan, but but that was part of the other guy's plan, and Kid, if you're slowing down 'cause you think you're doing bad right now, Jesus Christ. - That's a really good pitch. - Loving it. Man, you know, I I'm starting to think heists are just really dumb now, you know? I can't put my finger on why, but I'd really like to go. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, no, I-I'm sure. Man, it's as if someone stole his enthusiasm for his own idea. Yeah, without him even knowing about it. Without him even knowing about it. [BLEEP] Morty's still working on - that stupid heist script. - He's up in his room with his [BLEEP] thumb up his ass. Skipped out on the last three adventures. I don't know. Five of my friends got Netflix deals. - What? - It's a very achievable goal. - You could lose him. - I'm not gonna [BLEEP] lose him. [BLEEP] that. I-I'm gonna nip this shit in the bud. No. As a matter of fact, you're not nipping anything in the bud. If Morty ever gives up on a single dream, it had better be because of his own disillusionment. Hey, buddy. How'd it go? I-I don't want to talk about it. Morty, you know, pal, you, uh you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Yeah, I guess. Thanks for staying positive about my prospects, Rick. Of course! You know, you I got to help my grandson follow his dreams. Eh, who needs dreams? I'll just hang out with you and go on adventures and do whatever you want to do, you know, forever. Oh, well, uh, okay. I mean, if that's what you want. Oooo weee! Big storm coming. - Could be a twister. - Mm-hmm! Hey, Rick? Can you walk me through something? Yeah. What are you thinking? So, you and Morty knew you needed my help, but you weren't sure I was good enough at karate, so you hired my grad students to attack me? Yep. But it was an emergency, Rick. How long did that take? It actually took less training than you'd think. Your students all shared a pretty keen aptitude for martial arts. I don't know if that's by coincidence or if there's some correlation with their passion for African-American Women's Studies. Maya Angelou did personify both acquiescence and perseverance. Ooo wee. That's exactly the kind of connection I'd have loved to explore in my class. Too bad I lost my job for putting my students in the hospital. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Mm-hmm.

When Rick tries to brush it off, Morty brings up how he agreed to help with the adventure in exchange for one. Irritated by his constant demands, Rick sprays Morty with a gas which inadvertently knocks them both out and causes the [[Space Cruiser]] to start veering out of control as they head back towards Earth. After crashing, Rick wakes up in the hospital to Beth reiterating Rick's promise to Morty.  At home, a [[The Wizard|Wizard]] summons a dragon called [[Balthromaw]] and produces a blood oath contract that Morty signs, bonding him to the dragon forever.  [[file:S4e4 jerry and cat.png|thumb|Jerry and the talking cat.]] After Morty receives his dragon, [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] pulls Rick aside and inquires about a [[Talking Cat|talking cat]] he found in the house; Rick mentions that he has no idea about it before leaving. Accepting it, Jerry asks the cat several times why it can talk but the cat tells Jerry not to worry about it; to go with the flow and not ask too many questions. And that they go to Florida.  After Morty flies around with Balthromaw for a while, they land for a break. While Morty puts on the pretense that what they have is a partnership of equality, Balthromaw only wants to laze around, which Morty roundaboutly shuts down.   [[file:S4e4 get high.png|thumb|left|Rick and Balthromaw get high.]] The dragon retreats to a newly dug cavern underneath the Smith family yard; while Rick is watching TV with [[Summer Smith|Summer]], they both notice and poke fun at how dejected Morty is with a dragon. After Rick is nearly killed by the dozing dragon's flame breath, he goes to kill it; after he ambushes Balthromaw, Rick takes a close look at the treasure that he is guarding and is amazed by some of the contents. He decides to not kill Balthromaw and they go off and cause havoc at a nearby zoo. Enjoying the other's company, Rick and Balthromaw perform a \""Soul Bond\"" ritual, connecting their souls together.   [[file:S4e4 2019-12-10-15h02m03s959.png|thumb|Summer and Morty witness Rick and Balthromaw's soul bonding.]] While this happens, both Morty and Summer witness this, causing Morty to lash out in anger. This breach of the contract summons the Wizard and, pronouncing Balthromaw a slut dragon for having bonded to multiple riders, whips the dragon (which Rick can feel due to their bond) and takes the dragon away to sentence it. Rick, Morty, and Summer than travel to the dragon world to save Balthromaw and undo their soul bonding.  Meanwhile, with Jerry and the cat, they had a nice time with a bunch of party-goers playing volleyball on the beach until one discovers some cat poop barely covered in sand. The cat quickly blames it on Jerry, causing the party-goers to chase Jerry away and the cat goes with the party-goers onto a nearby party yacht. After the cat is later thrown off the boat, it swims back to Jerry.  [[file:S4e4 2019-12-10-16h04m51s028.png|thumb|left|The all-slut slut phoenix dragon, Slut vs. three dragons.]] While they attempt to free the dragon, Rick, Morty, and Summer learn that the bonding is permanent and nothing can be done; the four are then forced to flee into hiding. While laying low, they and Balthromaw encounter several other outcast/slut dragons including [[Debranavox|Debrah]], [[Michael (Dragon)|Michael]] and the Shadow Jacker. They eventually join forces via a massive soul-bond ritual and are able to fly back to the lair of the Wizard; the combined energy of the Smiths and the slut dragons kill the Wizard and frees Balthromaw, Rick, Morty and the other dragons. Since the Wizard is dead, the bond between Balthromaw and Rick is broken.  After returning home, Rick immediately leaves with the excuse that Jerry needs to be picked up from the airport with the talking cat and severs ties with the dragon. And Morty eventually dismisses Balthromaw as well, sending him away with disgust.  After traveling for a while, Rick makes a stop in the desert so they can supposedly stretch their legs and is able to trap the cat inside an energy box. Rick tells the confused cat that he will do a mind scan on it to discover why he can talk, despite the latter\u2019s repeated claims of being from space. Rick calls the cat out on the lie and looks through his vision goggles to discover the history. Subsequently, Rick is aghast by what he sees, looks away horrified. Seeing Rick act this way, Jerry wishes to see for himself but Rick tries in vain to stop him. Jerry ends up repeatedly vomiting in the sand before crawling backward away from the cat. The cat wants to amend things, but Rick banishes it in the desert; as the latter tries to plea with them; Rick and Jerry mutually scream at the cat to go away.   {{quote|He was in my home... where I keep photos of my parents!|Jerry}} [[file:S4e4 jerry's mind blowers.png|thumb|Rick mind blows Jerry, because someone will remember.]] Rick offers to erase Jerry's memories, the latter refuses, believing someone needed to remember. Despite this, Rick erases Jerry's memory anyway to spare him the mental anguish and torture.  The post-credits scene shows Balthromaw carrying his plunder through the street and scaring off a motorist who tried to proposition him. The cat soon arrives and the two decide to stick together, becoming friends who have been rejected by humans.","Rick, we did it! We... we got it! Hurry up, Morty. Get in! - Chachi! - f*ck Chachi, Morty. - Did you get it? - He helped me escape prison. Did you get the Ultimate Cube? Oh, it's purple. Y-You said it was purple. I said mine was. I didn't know they all were. And now we do, thanks to Chichi. Chachi. So, uh, w-w-when do I get it? Get what, a hug? Let's find a planet with a garden hose first. - A dragon. - A dragon. You asked me to cut class and fight robots with you. I said, ""No."" You said, ""Millions of lives depend on it."" I said, ""I'll do it for a dragon."" You said, ""Whatever."" I want my dragon. You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds that refuse to admit they're Christian. - I want my dragon. - Let me give you rocket shoes. Let me give you Wolverine claws. Let me give you a f*cking rocket hat. Just be sure to use it with the rocket shoes, or it'll rip your head off. I want my dragon! I want my dragon! - I want my dragon! - [GAS HISSES] - Oh. - Ha! Ha!

Jerry, why would I give Morty a talking dragon and you a talking cat at the same time? Those concepts bump. If you're talking to a cat, it's an abnormal event unrelated to me like when you went to Pluto or f*cked my daughter. Okay, there's really no need to get savage. CAT: So? Eh, he says he has nothing to do with your talking. - Told you. - So then why are you talking? - Why should that matter? - Why should it not matter? How do I know I'm not hallucinating? Rick said this is an abnormal event. Do you always need Rick to tell you what's going on? Maybe it's time you stopped asking questions and started having fun. Oh. Wow, okay. So, what do you want?

Morty passes on Beth\u2019s concerns that Jerry will kill himself in the light-hanging process. Jerry says he can hang lights safely; Rick responds by accusing Jerry of lying. Jerry promptly falls off the roof, but before he hits the ground, Rick zaps him with a ray that makes Jerry\u2019s body lighter than air. He then zaps Jerry\u2019s shoes with a ray that makes them heavier than air, rendering Jerry \u201cneutrally buoyant\u201d. As Rick and Morty climb into the spaceship, Jerry celebrates his buoyancy, which allows him to jump high up in the air and then slowly sink back down. Remembering a warning that the ray will eventually wear off, Jerry sets a timer to keep track of how long he will be neutrally buoyant.  In space, Rick and Morty are arguing about piss and centipedes when (somehow) the spaceship hits \u201ca sharp thing in space\u201d and gets a flat tire. Rick puts on a spacesuit and goes out to fix the flat, giving Morty strict instructions not to follow. Morty promptly ignores these instructions, dons a spacesuit, and goes outside. Rick, who is fixing the flat, starts yelling at Morty to go back in the ship. While the two are arguing, a snake astronaut slithers up and bites Morty in the ankle. Morty kills the snake by breaking its astronaut suit with a hubcap, but it is clear he has been seriously injured.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h05m23s343.png|thumb|Snake racism. As hilarious and stupid as human racism.]]  Soon afterward, Morty begins to turn purple, a symptom of the poison that the snake injected into him when it bit him. Rick flies to the snake\u2019s home planet, scans it, and synthesizes an anti-venom serum, which promptly cures Morty. The scan also reveals that the snakes on the planet have formed an advanced patchwork of industrial societies\u2014 there are 19 billion snakes divided into 10,000 nations, all on the brink of global war because of race. Rick remarks that the concept of racist snakes is hilarious, and begins to fly away. Morty, horrified that he killed an astronaut who might have been the snakes\u2019 last hope for survival, and despairs that he is the reason \u201c19 billion snakes lost all hope!\u201d Rick responds that the snakes\u2019 loss of hope is their own fault, reminding Morty that the snake astronaut bit its first alien contact.  On earth, we see Jerry bouncing into the city, where he sees a group of friends of many different races playing basketball together. Jerry asks to join the game, offering a bet that \u201cthis white boy can jump\u201d. The players take exception to Jerry\u2019s use of racial epithets, pointing out that the basketball court is the one place left in society that racism has not touched. Jerry tries to make amends, but ends up inadvertently implying that he is a Nazi. He decides to just try taking a jump shot, but as he jumps up, one of his shoes falls off, causing Jerry to go flying up into the sky as the basketball players look on, taking pride in the fact that their neighborhood has integrity.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h09m17s507.png|left|thumb|Morty stuffing Slippy into the snake spacesuit.]]  After returning from the space adventure, Morty continues to blame himself for the snake planet\u2019s impending doom. Having held onto the space snake\u2019s body, he holds a vigil, where he hatches an idea on how to restore hope to the snakes. He goes to a pet store & buys a snake roughly the size of the space snake to take her place, whom he names Slippy. Morty proceeds to draw markings on Slippy similar to the ones the space snake had and then force Slippy into the space snake\u2019s astronaut suit, being bitten multiple times in the process.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h10m21s798.png|thumb|Slippy picked up and on the snake news.]]  Morty then flies Slippy to the snake planet and throws her out the window. A parachute opens on the spacesuit, gently carrying Slippy down to the surface. Military officials from one of the nations on the snake planet detect Slippy and intercept her.     We then see a montage of Snake scientists, academics, politicians, and military officials attempting to interact with Slippy. The nation\u2019s president appears at a press conference with Slippy, who hisses at reporters in a language they don\u2019t understand. Snake academics record these hisses and attempt to decipher them. One snake professor finally manages to translate them. The military then recruits the professor to talk with Slippy, who is being held in a room at the Snake Pentagon. [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h13m31s663.png|left|thumb|The two snakes fuck.]] The professor talks with Slippy, first through an intercom and later by entering the room and speaking with her directly. Though Slippy seems suspicious at first, she eventually grows to trust the professor. She wraps herself around the professor in an aggressive display of affection. Though surprised, the professor quickly reciprocates, and the two make love while being monitored by other snake military officials.  Back on earth, Rick, Morty and Summer are playing Downbeat when Beth enters the room and asks about Jerry. Morty, much to Rick\u2019s chagrin, reveals that Rick made Jerry lighter than air. Beth expresses concern that Jerry will fall out of the sky to his death; Rick responds that that could only happen if Jerry messes up wearing shoes. Quickly realizing that that is in fact quite possible, Rick and Beth rush to find & save Jerry.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h16m58s956.png|thumb|Horrific Jerry clone head]]  Jerry is revealed to be flying through the sky while attempting to return to the ground. He has tied the legs of his pants together and is holding the torso area open so the pants will fill with rainwater. Beth calls Jerry on his cellphone and tries to convince him to tell her where he is so Rick can pick him up. Jerry tells Beth nothing is wrong and that he is just buying lights at the store. However, Rick notices that he is lying and freezes Beth using a special remote, and then tries to level with Jerry, but Jerry rebuffs Rick. As far as Jerry is concerned, his predicament is a \""win-win\"": if he survives and returns home, it will be without Ricks help, but if he dies, it will be entirely Rick's fault. Rick decides to let Jerry try to get out on his own as he manages to lower himself enough to grab onto a tree. Before unfreezing Beth, Rick activates a special gadget in his lair, which created a disfigured, fungus-grown Jerry head, whom he uses to trick Beth into thinking that her husband was okay.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h18m25s186.png|thumb|left|This bar has a lot of ceiling fans.]]  Meanwhile, in a bar, Jerry walks in, carrying a boulder into a bar and looks for a driver. The bartender and patrons tell Jerry he can\u2019t bring the boulder in with him. When Jerry drops the boulder, he floats up to the ceiling; the bartender and patrons tell him this isn\u2019t allowed, either. The patrons end up throwing Jerry out of the bar, causing him to immediately fly up into the sky again.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h20m31s672.png|thumb|A grotesque Terminator-esque robot comes to save the Smiths.]]  Back at the house, Morty is in his room when a snake-shaped robot [[Portal Technology|teleports]] to his position. The robot attempts to kill Morty, but a snake enters the room wielding a shotgun. The snake and robot fight with each other, and Morty runs to the garage, where he warns Beth and Rick about the snakes. Beth and Rick are initially skeptical at first, but when snakes and snake robots start appearing in the room and trying to kill Morty, they quickly get the message. Beth, Rick, and Morty grab weapons and try to kill the snakes, which keep attacking in growing numbers. A humanoid snake robot arrives to tell the family, but Beth crushes him to death in a panic. Morty asks Rick why the snakes would attack him when he was just trying to help them. Rick angrily responds that by sending Slippy to masquerade as the original astronaut, instead of leaving well enough alone, Morty unwittingly informed the snakes that there was something bigger and scarier to unite against. Now, instead of falling into the Dark Ages for a couple of generations, select snakes create new technology such as time travel in an attempt to kill him.    In other words, none of this chaos would be possible if Morty simply did what Rick said in space and stayed in the car.   [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h22m49s372.png|thumb|left|All hail Morty.]]  True to Rick's words, some time in the Snake Planet's future, the war costs the lives of 17 billion snakes by the end. Soon after, a new ''Terminator''-esque war rages between snakes and machines. The surviving snakes from the previous war managed to defeat the machines in part because Morty somehow helped unite them.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h22m59s512.png|thumb|Chaos in the Snake Pentagon]]  Back at the Snake Planet, Rick and Morty land on the planet where the war between snakes and machines is in its earliest stage. Rick and Morty fight their way into the Snake Pentagon, where they defeat robots and snake soldiers alike. They briefly see Slippy, who is being threatened by several time-traveling robot snakes and protected by time-traveling snakes, making her a central source of the conflict that can determine the planet's fate.   [[File:S4e5_2019-12-29-14h27m31s472.png|thumb|left|Snake M.I.T. in 1985]]  They then reach the center of \u201cSnakenet\u201d, where a time machine is under construction. They kill the scientists making the time machine, but they realize that it is not even a quarter finished, Rick makes a mental note to blueprint time travel in a format snakes can understand or, in his case, \""committing more to Morty's current 'fuck-ups' \"". As he said that, future versions of Rick and Morty show up with a book full of instructions on time travel written in the snakes\u2019 language, portable time machines, and snake costumes. Future Morty, who is sporting a black eye, rudely insults current Morty, and future Rick insults current Rick. Future Rick and Future Morty then leave. Rick and Morty put on the snake costumes, travel back to 1985, and leave the time travel instructions at Snake MIT before returning to the present, hoping the snakes' own self discovery will be their undoing.   After they leave, a snake student and his peers read the time travel instructions and use them to build a time machine. They send a student back to the 19th century to prevent Snake Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, sending him a letter which told him to duck, preventing his assassination. The student returns victorious, only to find that the ripple-effect of protecting Lincoln has altered the timeline and caused his present to be ruled by Snake Nazis.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h31m11s914.png|thumb|Snake time travel chaos]]  Not taking any chances, the student grabs a chainsaw and steps back into the time machine. In 1938, Snake Adolf Hitler is giving a speech in Snake Berlin. He then goes inside to take a shower. A series of snake time travelers show up\u2014 some seeking to kill Snake Hitler, others seeking to protect him, or just fight one another as Snake Hitler stares at them in confusion. The time travelers start killing each other, leading to pandemonium.  On earth in the present, Jerry briefly calls Beth to ask for help. When she doesn\u2019t answer, he leaves a voicemail promising to come home with \u201cthe best Christmas lights ever!\u201d He grabs ahold of a jet, which he holds onto when the neutral buoyancy wears off. A snake-human hybrid robot approaches Jerry and offers to save his life; Jerry, thinking the robot is from Rick, kicks it away, causing it to fly into the plane\u2019s engine. The plane careens toward the ground\u2014 Jerry jumps away at the last minute, grabs a tree, and climbs to safety.  Back on earth in the present, time-traveling snakes and snake robots are raining down on the suburbs, still fighting to the death. Summer & Beth are hard at work killing them, but to no avail. Morty worries that giving snakes time travel just made it worse, but Rick reassures him that things will work out in their favor, knowing what would happen next.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h33m35s614.png|thumb|left|4th Dimensional Time Cop Headquarters]]  In the fourth dimension, [[Shleemypants]] receives a phone call, informing him of the incident. He and another time cop travel to the snake planet and go back in time until they find the first snake to use tools. They proceed to beat that snake to death, thereby preventing the snake civilization (as we know it) from ever developing. In the present on earth, all the attacking snakes and snake robots suddenly disappear, the ones that haven't fallen writhing in pain before involuntarily eating their own tails. As this counted as one of Morty's adventures, Rick pulls out the card, but this time, he tears it apart, declaring that there are no freebies because of what happened.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h34m39s598.png|thumb|The only way to tie up a time travel story is ouroboros, or basically dealing with the source of the problem]]  Jerry reveals himself to be on the roof, and claims he was there the entire time. He then promptly falls off and breaks his leg. Rick heals the leg halfway, claiming that the other fifty percent is on him. He then remarks to Morty that Jerry sucks, yet Morty does not challenge this assertion Rick, Morty, and the family go inside to have some eggnog, only for the former two to once again encounter their future selves, who rudely remind them that they need to make snake costumes and translate time travel instructions into the snakes\u2019 language. Both Rick and Morty resign themselves to doing this.  [[file:S4e5 2019-12-29-14h38m02s569.png|thumb|left|Merry Christmasssss.]]  In the post-credits scene, they finish the instructions and time machines and travel to the snake planet to hand off the instructions, but before doing so, Rick punches Morty in the eye while reminding him to stay in the car next time. This resolves the causality loop and explains Morty\u2019s black eye.  {{-}}",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

This adventure is gonna be a long haul, and I don t feel like emptying the jug. Jerry, will you please just let me automate this fucking task?  I didn t ask for anyone s help. You two are welcome to leave.  Mom told me she wanted me to stay here to make sure you didn t die.  Well, you tell your mother that I m gonna be fine.  Don t train your child to lie, Jerry, even though, you know,  tis the season.  Then I ll tell her. Whoa! I told you, no more rays. What ray did you zap me with?  I made your atomic matrix slightly lighter than air, and now your shoes are heavier than air, which makes you neutrally buoyant, which I find personally more impressive conceptually than walking on water, but what do I know? I wasn t born into the god business. I fucking earned it.  Whoa!  Just to be clear, this doesn t mean you helped me. It wears off in 10 hours, and the next hit will cost you 30 bucks.

Here, I ve got a centipede you can swallow that makes you not have to go.  I ain t swallowing no centipede.  What, you think the centipede wants to eat your pee?  You re not the victim in this transaction. Uh-oh, flat tire.  How the hell do you get a flat tire in space, Rick?  Obviously from a sharp thing in space, Morty.  It s just crazy how much it feels like getting a regular flat.  Oh, no, no, that s just my custom-programmed, fully immersive flat-tire indication experience. I can turn it off. I thought it was cooler than the celebrity voice package, but here.  CHRISTOPHER WALKEN: Flat tire you should be walkin .  Oof.   Yeah.  Can I come out with you, Rick?  No, I ve seen this movie. Two guys leave the ship. One guy goes spinning away. You re staying in here where it s safe. Morty, goddamn it.   Come on. I n I never get to be out here.  Ugh, you young people think space is like \""Saturday Night Live. \"" You see it every day, so you dream of being in it, but it dreams of removing all the air from your body and making you float around it for eternity as a flash-mummified corpse, which is also what space wants, so get back in the car.  I m not in danger. There s nothing out here.  Literally everything is out here, and unlike everywhere else, I m too busy to help you.  Right, because you re always so helpful. Ah! God damn it. What is that?  Obviously, it s a space snake.  T-There s snakes in space?  There s literally everything in space, Morty! Now get the fuck back in the car.   I m dying, Rick. I can see the black mountain.  People who are really dying don t keep bring it up.  Is that true?  I don t know. I m just usually around people that die faster. All right. All right. J-Just let me analyze the snake s planet, so I can whip up an antivenom. Computer, you might want to put a rush on this. Morty s starting to look like a  90s Japanese ghost.  COMPUTER: Cutting corners.  Oof, oh, my God, these snakes are a mess. 19 billion snakes divided into 10,000 nations all on the brink of global war over race. How funny is that? Imagine being a racist snake. \""Hey, other snake, I hate you because you re the wrong color, snake. \"" Oh, my God. You re not laughing? Oh, you re dying. It s a miracle they were able to fling one this far out before they slithered into extinction.  Oh, oh, God, I killed their What s his name, their Buzz Aspirin?

Idiots. Let s get moving. We ve got a long way to go, and I m not sharing that centipede.  Rick, wait. Go back. I-I can t be the reason why 19 billion snakes lost all hope.  That s right, Morty. Only 19 billion snakes can do that. That species was never getting beyond this stage. To paraphrase the great Jeff Foxworthy, if you bite your first contact on its ankle, you might be a type-zero-civilization-neck.  What up, homeys? Shooting hoops, I see. Hey, who s interested in a friendly bet that this white guy can jump.  Hey, leave the racial stuff off the court, okay?  Oh, I thought that kind of talk was part of street ball.  Well, now it s part of everything else, so chill.  We We got off on the wrong foot. My name is Jerry Smith. I live in the suburbs. I m only here because I have a certain power I wanted to kind of celebrate before it goes away.  Yo, we got a Nazi up here.  Hey, I think there s a misunderstanding. Here, just just watch. Huh? Help! Help! I-I need that shoe!  No, no, don t touch that shoe or that money. Let them be a powerful but confusing monument to our neighborhood s integrity.  Oh, boy, what an adventure, huh?  Hey, Morty, listen. I can tell you re pretty upset about the whole snake encounter thing, so I ll tell you what. I m just gonna go ahead and avoid you for the rest of the day. Play snake jazz.  I-Is this one friendly?  It s a snake.  You ever You ever see this one look up at the sky like it s dreaming of something more?  No, but, uh, all those ones marked with red sticker, yeah. Any snake over 50 bucks yearns for the beyond. I-I-I ve seen them do it.  Ow! Damn it, Slippy, come on. Ow! Just please. I m sorry.  MAN ON TV: Everyone has a plumbus in their home. First, they take the dinglepop.  Ow! Fucking monster.  Downbeat.  How do you win this fucking game?  We-We ve never gotten that far.  Guys, did I not tell you to keep your eye on Jerry?  We did.  Then where is he? Maybe he s having an affair.  But for real, has anyone seen him?  Grandpa, did you trap him in a painting again?  I didn t do shit. Well, y-y-you made him floaty.  Asshole.  Made him floaty?  I saved his life by making his body slightly lighter than air, and it expires in a couple of hours. Expires, like he ll fall out of the sky? He won t by in the sky, Beth, unless it s possible for Jerry to fuck up wearing shoes. Oh, crap, he s gonna die.  What were you thinking?  Hey, babe.  Jerry, are you in the air? Rick told me he made you floaty.  Made me floaty? Pfft. Got to love Rick s world view. Yes, I had Rick make me floaty so I could put up some lights. Now, I m at the light store. Get away! Sorry, this lady at the store is trying to peck me. Yes, you can help me find lights after I m off the phone.  We re in Rick s ship. How about we just pick you up?   You re with Rick? Well, why wouldn t I-  Jerry, I paused Beth with a device Christopher Walken gave me after a record session. Real talk, buddy, where you at?  Go to hell, Rick.  Come on, Jerry. I can recognize the sound of a seagull.  Can you recognize the sound of a man s pants filling up with rain?  I hope to one day. Jerry, I ll tell you what. Because it s Christmas, I m gonna do you a favor. I won t let you die, and I won t tell Beth that you almost killed yourself.  Sounds like a win-win to me.  Come again?  If I survive, it ll be without you, and if I die, it ll be on your ass. Merry Christmas, bitch. I am the Jesus Christ of Christmas!  -I be with him?  We both care. Whoa. Jerry.  Yes, honey?  Let us just come get you.  Beth, I am so touched that you care for me this much, but I m fine, and I just want to put up these Christmas lights, and I WILL EAT YOUR WORLD!  Honey, my dad can hear you.  Got to go. See you soon.  Okay.  Well, it sounds like he s fine.  Yeah, I m almost kind of rooting for him this time.  One Diet Sprite Remix, please, and, uh, is anyone here an Uber driver?  You can t bring that boulder in here.   What?  I said no boulders. This ain t the lake, buddy.  Drop the rock.  Well, it s kind of a a service boulder. Yeah, I float without it.  Big man holding a big rock, think you can take me down?  No, obviously not. You re huge!  Then put it down!  Put the boulder down!  If I put it down, I m going to float!  Drop it!  Put it down!  And frankly, your bar has a lot of ceiling fans.  You think you re better than us?  Drop the rock!  Put it down!  Okay, okay, okay. Hey, whoa, what the fuck!  Stop doing that.  I told you this would happen!  Well, stop floating!  Who said you could float here!?  I can t control it! Aaaaaaaaaah!  And take your girlfriend with you.  Summer, how supes shook am I about your playlisting fleekness tonight?  You love it? It s snake jazz. My little brother got bit by a snake in outer space and killed it with a hubcap, and my grandpa had to scan its planet s culture for an antivenom, and they found this. It s my jam.  Seriously, my new thing now is snake jazz.  Can you alter the course of a species  evolution like that without repercussions?  Gee, I don t know, Nancy. Can you alter the course of being a giant fucking nerd?  Sorry.  Also, later, we need to discuss your clothing and your weight.  That s fair.  What the hell?  Target acquired.  Snakes! Get back in the car!  Morty, enough with the snakes!  Target acquired.  Aliens, I am a robot sent back in time by the Snake Resistance to protect you from Serpacorp. My appearance is designed to be familiar and to put you at ease.  The ape child must be eliminated to protect our timeline.  Morty, what the hell did you do? I was just trying to do the right thing. I took a living snake...-  Get behind me. I will protect-  Aaah!  Why Why are they attacking us? I-I-I helped them.  You gave them proof that there was something bigger and scarier to unite against, you little idiot. They would have gone back into the Dark Ages for a couple of generations, but instead, they dedicated themselves into making universe-destroying, un-thought-out technology like time travel all so they could try to kill a little shitsack on Earth who couldn t let a dead snake be dead even after it bit his ankle. Next time, STAY IN THE FUCKING CAR!  NARRATOR: Seventeen billion snake lives ended on June 21, 2026. The survivors lived only to face a new nightmare, - the war between snake and machine. - In the end, snake overcame machine because of what we couldn t predict that an alien, a child from a distant star, would save us.  W-Where are we going? W-What are we doing here, Rick?  We got to get the heart of Snakenet. Now, shut up, and stay close.  Resistance is mouselike.  Whoa, hey, look. That one s actually really cool. Come here, little guy. Gah, you little son of a bitch! Come on, Morty!  Your brood must be exterminated!  You will not kill her or her brood!  Must kill brood and mother.  Get behind me, your brood will seed all life on this planet.That doesn t make sense.  Hey, it s it s Slippy! Keep up, shitbag.  BETH: Hi, you went directly to voicemail because your number is not in my phone. Don t leave a message.  Hi, honey. Uh, look. Morty told me that you didn t think I could hang lights without killing myself. Look, I want to be a strong man for you, but the truth is The truth is, I m coming home with the best lights ever.  Oof. Whoa, feel that turbulence?  Nope, I m on Mali.  Give me some.  Ahh.  Aaaah!  I don t suppose you guys will take a bribe?  Ah! Anyone else want legs?  God damn it. Are you kidding me? I thought there d be a time machine in here. They re not even a quarter of the way through making it. I m gonna have to invent it for them. I-I don t know snake math. Ugh, I didn t want to have to do this. Fuck!  All right.  W-What s going on? What are you doing?  I m reminding myself to commit even more to your fuckup.  Hey, assholes.  Fuck you! Takes one to know one!  What the heck? Hey, man, you you okay?  You know what, fuck you.  What? Screw you.  Here!  Come on. Was it really that hard?  What do you think?  Come on, Morty.  Man, I-I-I wonder why I had a black eye.  Morty, shut the fuck up and put these on.  Okay, so w-what are we doing?  That book has everything they need to create snake time travel, a-and they re getting it in 1985, snake time. Now, they re gonna do it so early that it won t involve us, and they re gonna be even stupider with it.  Huh, a-and then what?  We re removing ourselves from this sloppy, fucked up story and letting snake time travel eat its own tail.    (Just then, a couple of snake professors arrive and find the book on their table. One of them opens it and looks at the contents with amazement. His colleagues look and they formulate a plan. In 1865 ST, Snake Abraham Lincoln is watching a play at Snake Ford s Theater when a strange-looking snake slithers towards him and hands him a note before disappearing. Snake Abraham Lincoln reads the note and ducks, successfully avoiding Snake John Wilkes Booth s assassination attempt as one of his guards comes and grabs him. The snake, being a student from 1985, returns to his time and lets out a fist bump, only for his professor to salute angrily. The student looks around, realizing that his world was now fascist, and proceeds to knock the professor out cold before grabbing a chainsaw. In Snake Berlin, Snake Adolf Hitler finishes giving off a speech before going into the bathroom to take a shower. Soon enough, a snake tries to assassinate him, only for another to protect him, and so on as he stares off in confusion at the brawl going on in his room, which seeps into the outside as snakes started popping into Snake Berlin from different points in time.    Just have to keep my grip.  Jerry Smith, I am here to save you.  What? I already told Rick I don t want help!  I do not know Rick. I was sent by a society of human-snake hybrids...  Classic Rick.  ...from an alternate version of-  I did it! We re landing! I knew I could do it. BAH HA HA HA HA!  Jesus Christ, Rick, it s pandemonium out there! T-This is worse than when we left. Rick, look, Summer!  Nobody chokes me without consent.  Y-You just made things worse, Rick.  Trust me, Morty. We helped them press on the gas pedal. We just got to wait for them to blow by a cop.  Shleemypants here, what s up? Snakes? Time travel? They did what? How the fuck did... Okay, okay, I m on it. We got a 10-51 on a goddamn snake planet.  Don t look at me. I m afraid of snakes.  I m afraid of snakes BULLSHIT! You afraid of work! That s what you afraid of!  All right, all right.  Let s go take care of this.  Oh, look at you. You a smart snake, huh? You using tools now, huh?  Those tools are gonna turn into you manipulating the fabric of shit!  Get over here, motherfucker.  What the fuck you think you doing?  Don t fuck with time!  You don t fuck with time!  Holy shit!  What happened?  Look, this is better than them attacking us.  Also, that s about as much curvature as you re gonna get from a time-travel story. You know what? This one counts as one of your adventures.  Hey, come on.  No freebies.  Aw, man, I-I wanted to go to Boob World.  Well, now, we can t because you fucked up. Got to learn a lesson. You want to go to Boob World, Summer?  Eh, not today.  This sucks.  Hey, honey, check it out. Jerry, I was worried about you. Oh, just killing some snakes up here like everyone else, I guess, and finishing the Christmas lights.  Wait, the whole time? I was screaming for help, and you stayed on the roof?  I couldn t hear you over my own screaming. We ve talked about this.  Well, I m just glad you re safe.  Well, duh, of course, I m safe. Hey, guess what, asshole. I did it without you. Whoa! Ah! Oh, God, it hurts.  What was that?  I healed your leg fifty percent. The rest is on you, big man.  That s what I m talking about, respect, my brother.  Geez, your dad sucks. All right, Morty. Let s go enjoy a little bit of eggnog, huh?  All right.  Not so fast, boys.  Yeah, I think you might be forgetting something.  Merry Christmas, fucknuts. Get to work.  Geez, I don t see why you have to be smug about it.  A bunch of bullshit.  That s not necessary.  This fucking sucks.  Yeah, it s fun until it s you, huh, shitnog?  Yeah, have fun sewing those snake costumes together, you little tramp.  You tell them, Morty.  Geez, you guys don t have to be dicks about it, all right?  Yeah, neither did the guys before us, but you know what? They were. Merry Christmas, you shitbags.   Yeah, ghost of Christmas future, bitches, you fucking idiots.  So mean.  Those guys are mean.  Man, I just want to open my Christmas presents.  Well, I m waiting on you to finish those snake costumes. I m almost done.  You know what? T-They re good enough. I m done.  All right.  Let s go.  All right.  We re landing. Come on.  Man, I can t believe we re almost done, Rick. I can practically taste the eggnog. Hey, you know what? I feel like we re forgetting something.

A conductor with a red misshapen nose says \""Tickets, please\"" and takes his ticket. The man sits down at the bar. A second man sits next to him and asks the bartender for a drink for his \""colleague\"", presuming they are both on the train to kill Rick Sanchez. He suggests to the first man that they swap stories and begins his own.  In the story, the second man is seated on a throne of skulls and orders his minions to lower a prisoner into a vat of acid. Rick enters. The man asks Rick how Rick found him; Rick responds to his questions with farts. The man orders his minions to attack Rick, who quickly defeats his attackers. The man from the bar says, \""Now *I'll* fight you!\"" Uncharacteristically, Rick looks scared and flees.  Back on the train, the second man now asks the first man why he's going to kill Rick; the first man replies annoyed that he doesn't know any Rick Sanchez. As others begin telling their own stories of Rick, the first man leaves the dining car. In the next car, the man encounters a circle of storytellers regaling one another with heartwarming tales of Rick's good deeds. Goomby, one of the storytellers, relates the story of how Rick saved \""Space Christmas\"". The group laughs appreciatively, then aggressively demands the man should tell his own \""Christmas Rick\"" story. The first man angrily declines and threatens them with his gun so that he can leave the car.  Entering the next car, he encounters a blonde woman wearing a low-cut top, whom he threatens to shoot if she cues up a Rick vignette. In explaining she doesn't know how she got there, she begins a cutaway story in which she enters a train car (the conductor appears from behind a plant and takes her ticket) and meets an older woman who asks her why she dated Rick Sanchez. The older woman embarks on her own cutaway story about when Rick met her family, which is interrupted by a warning shot from the man's gun. He admonishes the blonde woman for beginning a vignette; she protests that she wasn't trying to. The man begins to monologue about the train amplifying and linking narratives. When the woman becomes distracted by her own cleavage, the man realizes what's happening, and the two reveal themselves to be Rick and Morty in disguise.  Rick explains they are stuck in a literal story device, an anthology. The conductor enters. Pointing his gun, Rick tells him to stop the train, but the conductor turns out to be a powerful fighter. After he skillfully uses Morty as a human shield, Rick instead shoots the train window, sucking the conductor half out the window.  The conductor is suddenly in an arcade. He pulls off a helmet attached to a game (which he's just lost) called \""Tickets Please\"". He returns to his family but doesn't believe anything is real. Moments later the top half of his body tears away bloodily and begins to pirouette toward the arcade ceiling, spraying blood everywhere. The scene cuts back to outside the train, where the window Rick shot has cut the pirouetting conductor in half.  Rick plugs the hole in the window, but so much air has gone that the train deploys \""emergency continuity\"" as oxygen masks that drop down. Rick breathes in, then takes the large tank connected to the masks labeled \""Continuity\"". Train police break in, threaten Rick and Morty to tee up a story about Rick and end up shooting the tank, which explodes.  Cut to a police training class, which is using the last scene as an educational tool. But Rick and Morty are suddenly among the students. They subdue the students and the teacher, and Rick finds a diagram labeled \""Anthology\"" in the teacher's desk that shows a circle with eight segments (Dan Harmon's \""story circle\"").  The train rumbles, signaling an act break and a musical number with Rick and Birdperson. Via the continuing narrative of the pirouetting conductor at the arcade, the story winds its way back to Rick and Morty, wearing space suits and walking on the hull of the train. After putting the conductor out of his misery, Rick and Morty must disrupt the \""thematic seal\"" by Morty telling an unrelated story. Morty eventually succeeds by telling a story of Summer and Beth fighting off scorpions with their period rays. The two of them make it into the train's engine compartment before Rick runs out of air, only to confront Story Lord (\""like a Matrix space Frasier\"").   Story Lord captures and binds them and reveals his plan: drain Rick and Morty of story potential to fuel the anthology train. After a series of cutaway narratives, modulated by Story Lord's control panel (which influences things like \""narrative energy\"" and \""broad appeal\"") , Rick and Morty find themselves in a final narrative that Story Lord views through a runed portal: the pair must face armies of Meeseeks, Citadel Guards, male Gazorpians and Evil Morty. Rick defeats Story Lord's plans by telling Morty about Jesus Christ, his personal savior. The control panel drains of power, and the train grinds to a halt.  As Veggie-Tales-like cartoon characters surround Rick and Morty, Story Lord jumps into the narrative through the portal to yell at them. Jesus Christ descends from the heavens and drives everyone to their knees, and Rick and Morty use the distraction to leap back through the portal, trapping Story Lord in the narrative. But when they try to restart the train, the controls crumble away, fake.  Cut to Rick and Morty in the Smith living room looking at a glowing model train traveling in a circle. Morty has bought it for Rick at the Citadel. Rick expresses great happiness that Morty spent money and engaged in capitalism. In the train narrative, Story Lord is talking to Jesus Christ, who decides to escape by summoning magic blood. In the living room, the train short-circuits and derails.   Rick grows angry that the train is broken. When Morty suggests that he could return the broken train, Rick gets angrier and tells Morty to buy another one instead, reminding him that \""''nobody's out there shopping with this [[Wikipedia:COVID-19 pandemic|fucking virus]]!''\""  The post-credits scene is an ad for Story Train.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

(The man gives him a ticket, to which he tears off one half and returns it to the man. Indistinct chatter is heard as the man sits at the stools, to which another man greets him.)       Ramamama Leader:    Barkeep. A drink for my colleague.     ???:    Do I know you?     Ramamama Leader:    I know the only reason to travel by train is to travel with weapons. And we all know that at the end of this line, There s only one creature worth killing. The man in the white coat. May as well take turns exchanging stories. Mine begins on planet Ramamama.    (We flash back to the man s story, where he is seen leading a group of people, sitting on a throne in a cold lair with a pit of acid by his side.)       Ramamama Leader:    Lower him into acid. Once he s dissolved, lower someone else into acid. Is he dissolved? At least use the downtime to reset the acid lowerer. I really don t like the attitude around here. It s a very \""lower me into acid\"" attitude.    (The door slams open, revealing Rick Sanchez)       Ramamama Leader:    Who are you?     Rick:    (Farts)     Ramamama Leader:    How did you reach my sanctum?     Rick:    (Farts)     Ramamama Leader:    All right, this is going in circles. Seize him!     Guards:    ( All shouting )    (The guards charge at Rick, to which the mad scientist counters by shooting at them. He then drinks a potion that makes him grow three extra arms, each with their own gun. Once the guards are dead, he takes a pill that reverts him back to normal, but grows an extra butt soon afterwards.       Rick:    (Farting)     Ramamama Leader:    Very well. Now I will fight you.  (  Rick then flees, it then snaps back to reality.)       Ramamama Leader:    Anyway, he tells a different version of the story Where I start crying or something. That s why he has to die.  Cause he s a liar. So... Why are you going to kill Rick Sanchez?     ???:    Okay, I don t know who that is. I don t accept your weird leap in logic that has everyone on a train going to kill one guy. And even if I did, why would we take turns telling stories about it like little girls at a sleepover?     Ramamama Leader:    If you re trying to be hurtful, you re doing a good job.     Clam       Alien:    I ll take his turn. Here s why I m going to kill Rick Sanchez.     ???:    You guys have fun with this.     Clam Alien:    Dissolve to a clam-shaped sun Rising over a giant beach.     ???:    Whew. ( sighs )     Candy Santa Alien:    By then, of course, he had left toys And flesh drops for every one of us in the spore-hive. Ah, a newcomer! I suppose you think you have a better story about how Rick Sanchez saved space Christmas.     ???:    What is with the Rick Sanchez obsession?     Aliens:    ( laughter )     Goomby:    I think the best way to answer that is with my Christmas Rick tale.  Whoo!  Could ve used Rudolph tonight!  Oh, thank god. I m not too late. I don t know how to thank you, Goomby.  No need, you just go in there and have a nice time.  I will.  Thanks.    (Door opens)    Hey. Merry Christmas, Goomby.  Merry Christmas, Rick.  Oh. Uh... Oh, it s okay. I-I don t have to. Sorry if that was... No. Um, um, I can ask. No, no, no, I don t wanna be a burden. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, there s just... There s a lot of people. Family. You know? I get it. You re not mad? Totally fine. Bye.    ( Wind whistling )       Aliens:      (laughter)       ???:    That... Okay, none of my business but he didn t even save Christmas in that story. Oh, how dare you! That doesn t mean I m invested.     Goomby:    Tell your Christmas Rick story!     ???:    Step the hell back! Back!     ???:    (Panting)     ???:    You start teeing up a Rick Sanchez vignette, and you ll be doing it through two holes.     ???:    I m just trying to figure out what s going on with this train.     ???:    Do you remember getting on it?     ???:    No. First thing I remember is...  Tickets, please.  So, why did you date Rick Sanchez?     ???:    What?  Oh, you don t have to pretend you didn t date him. We all did. We get it. Low point in your life, rebound from an ex, et cetera.     ???:    No, really, who?  ( Chuckles ) Oh, exactly. In fact, and get this, when he met my family... ( wolf growling ) Aah! ( Grunting ) Leah! Leah, check it out. Where d you meet this, um... ( sighs ) ...Sprite? He s actually a human. But he invented portal tech? I am the concept of time.     ???:    Jesus!     ???:    I warned you not to do that.     ???:    I wasn t trying.     ???:    You don t have to. The train is obviously amplifying and linking unrelated narrative fields.     Morty:    Uh-huh...  Morty? I told you if you found me again, identify yourself. I didn t know it was you. How did you not recognize me? Didn t you create the disguises? When I create shit, it works, Morty. It s called being talented. Why can t we find the engine? It s not a real train, it s a story device. Literally. A literal literary device Quite literally metaphorically containing us. A simulation. Worse. An anthology. Okay, so how... H-How do we hijack it? Oh, Morty, it s been hijacked for at least two full minutes. Are you not hearing this insane conversation? Okay, tickets please guy, stop the anthology. If we wanted one-offs, we d do interdimensional cable, Not some uptight, overwritten... Rick? God damn! Tickets, please. Dude, I m sure you ve got, like, So many tickets at this point. Jesus! The tickets please guy is cut! He... he... he s... he s got those things. W-What do you call them. Uhm, cum gutters. Morty, gross! That s what people call them. Gross people. I don t want to have to picture cum so watery in such volumes that... Hey, hey, hey, stay back. I ll kick you. I-I ll kick your shin, bro. Aaah! Hey! I ll fucking cook and eat your ticket-taking ass! ( Coughs ) Hey, I found a ticket. ( Coughs ) Wow, you are just... Ladies and gentlemen, The Jackie chan of human shielding. Who takes the time to get this good at... Fuck this. Aaah... Structural breach. Losing continuity. Morty, hold on to something. Keep your head inside. Aaah! ( Gasps ) ( Video games beeping ) Share with your sister, Josh. Just because it s your birthday doesn t mean You can be an asshole. You okay, dad? Is this real? I doubt it, but you get what you get When you eat dinner in an arcade. I mean are you real, is life real? Okay, I m calling the nurse because you are not doing this tonight. You re god damn right I m not because... You are not doing this tonight! This isn t real life! Dad? Oh, my god! Honey. Sweetie. What s happening? Give me your tickets. I... I need tickets. Everyone give me tickeeeeeettttttts! Aaaah! Aaah! Female voice: Emergency continuity deployed. ( breathing heavily ) ( Groans ) This could come in handy. Can t we just ride out the... Fuck you, I d rather die. ( Crashing ) Train cops! Hands in the air! Tee up a story about Rick Sanchez! He is Rick! Jesus Christ! Is that the tickets please guy? Well, just the stub. Too soon! Too soon! Don t move! Too soon! So, what did the train cops do wrong? Shot... People? Hot passengers. Wrong. The passengers tampered with the anthology s structure. Lethal response was permitted, But not with him holding that tank. Let s take a look at what they should have done. Train cops! Hands in the air! Drop the tank! Drop it! Drop it! Drop the tank. ( Applause ) Sorry to nitpick, sir, but if there was A continuity explosion, isn t there always one? And doesn t that mean those two could be anywhere? What? No, you idiot, that... it s... it s just a training video. That didn t actually happen. That s what you think. Hey. How d you get here? Yeah, like we re the ones that popped up out of nowhere? Fuck these guys. ( Grunting ) Hey, what the hell? Your leg is healed. Yeah, it s a real free-for-all. Here we go. Of course this thing is just a fucking circle. You d think it was so God damn complicated... Okay, here s where the stupid vignettes were. God, imagine if that had been the whole thing. So now we re here, and the engine must be here. I ll have to rig us a couple of space suits that start failing around here so we can ( burps ) pay a heavy price for re-entering at this threshold. We have to leave the train? We don t have to do anything, Morty. This is just a structural guide. We re obviously gonna impart our own style. I don t like how meta this is getting, Rick. Shut up, Morty. You re 14. You watch videos of people on YouTube Reacting to fucking YouTube. I ll be the judge of when we get too meta. Holy shit. How is he still breathing? Aah! He s suspended in disbelief, Slowly dying while living out an alternative Non-diagetic reality. Geez, what a horrible way to die. You don t know the half of it. Oh! ( both laugh ) You re on fuego with the guy-torn-in-half bits, Rick. That one was organic, though. That s because you re naturally funny. That... that s good old-fashioned fun Right there, you know? W-w-we don t need to over-think shit, okay? Okay, buddy. Nice and grounded, Fully immersive from here on out. ( Rumbling ) Right after this. W-What s happening? Going into an act break.  266a Not quite a bird  266a  266a Not quite a person  266a  266a Maybe what matters  266a  266a Is to love yourself first and  266a  266a Soar  266a  266a Child of air and land  266a  266a With wings and hands  266a  266a Yes, you re a bird and a person  266a  266a I m a bird and a person  266a  266a And more  266a Sure, that was a great moment, But it was hardly the best time Rick and Morty were musical. Who can forget the t... Hey. You guys think there s something weird about this train? We ve been here a really long time And nobody s taken our tickets. Aaah! ( All screaming ) Aaaah! The galaxy s greatest scientists continue to ponder The horrific figure known to children as floaty blood man. But after three months, nobody is any closer to the truth. For cutesy name news, I m uncle nibbles. I can t believe floaty bloody man is real. He s more than real, he s my new God. Check it. Is that brand-new, Or is the blood just... Accurately depicted, yeah. His followers believe the entire universe is floaty bloody man s nightmare as he dies in a time-dilated reality. So we could go at any minute. No. I m part of the floaty nogasm brotherhood. We believe we re keeping him alive By redirecting our suppressed sexual energies. You re staying a virgin Just to keep the universe existing? That s... So attractive. It is? Okay, look, let s just do it once. ( Moaning ) Sorry. Aaah! Happy now? He was suffering. Keep moving. We have to get to the return threshold Before the ticking clock on your suit gets to zero. Why would you put ticking clock... Because if it s too easy to get there, We ll never get there. If you don t want to be meta stop, deconstructing shit. That s the thematic seal. Gotta find a way to disrupt it. Okay, Morty, tell a story unrelated to us. Uh, what do... Stop thinking and do it! Uh, okay, uh, there was this... My name is Mike Johnson. That s good coffee. ( Doorbell rings ) Better get that door. Iiiiiiii, hello. I want your cookies. I m hungry, I want your cookies. Scorpions, scorpions. There s scorpions outside. Get inside. What do they want from us? They want food. Me too. Rick: Okay, just stop. I m not a writer, okay? Relax, your story was supposed to be awful and stupid. I just failed to predict how well that would mesh with the theme. Think. Think. What kind of story would we never... Morty, do you know what the bechdel test is? The what? For God s sake, Morty, The formula for measuring female agency in a story proposed by Lesbian cartoonist Allison... What the hell are they teaching you in that school?! Other stuff! Then you ve killed us both! Why is Lesbian part of her job title?! Oh, now you re progressive?! What is the test?! You have to tell... ( beeping ) ( Gagging ) Morty, Morty. Two women. They both have to have names And talk to each other about something... Rick! ...other than a man... Oh, Rick, listen to me. Once upon a time, my mom and my sister... Listen to me! Mom, can I try your tea? Yes, summer. Yes. Try my tea. It s so good. It s so warm. Mom, can I talk to you about my special time? It s okay. I have one, too. Mine is heavy today. Mine is never light. I love you ever since you were... mailed to me. By a doctor woman. Your special time is your power. It makes you strong like a boob. Strong against what? Scorpions. Female scorpions. They re attacking outside. Come on. Fight them with your heavy special time. You do it, too. ( Epic music plays )  266a  266a ( Cellphones ring ) Hello? Hello? I m that supreme court lady, and you fucking did it. We did it! We did it! ( Grunts ) Great job, Morty. A feminist masterpiece. Hey, look. Guess who s got two penises and all the agency? Rick and Morty. Story lord. I should ve known you were behind this, and I did. Who is this guy? Ugh. He s like a matrix space frasier. Let s get this fight over with, nerd. I ve got shit to do. You of all people know, Rick, There can be no destination without a journey. I don t know that at all. I regularly teleport. Oh, of course. No rules for you. Spiraling through the multiverse, Burping semi-improvised dialogue about how nothing matters, So we may as well pull out our dicks and rub them On fate s glaring teeth like we re brushing fate s teeth But we re using your gross, dirty dick. Must be nice. ( Slurps ) Nobody s stopping you. True. Not anymore. ( Grunts ) Goddamn! We already did this. Oh, is this a double beat? Oh, well. Just how I adventure, dawg. This is more impressive than the tickets please guy, though. You are like 90% cum gutter. It s called discipline. Watch this. God damn. Geez! Do we have to fight him? I don t want to. We surrender. We re not fighting. ( Grunting ) Ow! Ow! Fucking kick your ass. Ow! Oh! ( Alarm ringing ) Hey! Get back in your egg! What the... Don t worry, Morty! Nothing out there is canon! ( Grunts ) We ve got a pulse. Stay with me, private. Smith, listen to me. You were exposed to a chemical that is altering your mind. To beat it, you have to hold on... We re losing him. Aliens. Sarge?! Morty, never forget the highest truth of all... You re getting your ass kicked on a train. ( Grunts ) Professor Sanchez? Did it work? I wouldn t say that, Marcus. I d say it   fucking   worked. 100% time dilation and total immersion. Define \""total.\"" Marcus, I ve been back in reality for three hours, and I still have memories of a completely different life. I-I-I was a scientist still. I-I-I was... I-I-I had developed Inter-dimensional travel, I-I-I-I had a daughter. I-I didn t have a mustache. I-I was kinda funny sometimes, mostly burping. No more secret testing. I can help people now. You ve helped people. I ve hurt more. Aaah! P-p-professor Sanchez. I-I m Morty Smith From the... the... The the 241st. They... they... put your pill in our food. It... it works. Call the police! It s okay. It s okay. It s not real. N-n-n-n-nothing s real. I m sorry, son. I-I-it s okay. You aren t real. ( All screaming ) God, you re right. I should do more freeform stuff. In you go. What s happening? The reason I brought you here. I ll now fuel my anthology with your limitless potential, propelling it to its final stop... beyond the fifth wall. You idiot. Our potential isn t limitless. You ll never break the fifth wall Before you ve burnt us out. Is that so? Oh, well. Win-win. Rick, w-what s he doing? He s trying to tap into us, Morty. Resist. I can t believe you re finally headed off to college. Yeah, you know, it really felt like you were gonna be 17 forever. For, like, 16 years, at least. I can t believe I m tearing up over this. Jesus, Rick, you know, you ve really softened up. It s a human moment, Morty. It s a human moment. Aaah! Aaah! It hurts! ( Crashing ) Abradolph lincoler? I thought you were dead. I m very much alive, and I need your help. Yeah! Shit, he s taking the good stuff, Morty. Wait, is... is any of this canon? It could have been. ( Chuckles ) Oh, dear. Are there things Rick Sanchez holds sacred after all? ( Whirring ) ( Both groaning ) ( Grunts ) How did you find us? ( Grunting ) I trusted you! Don t blame others for your bad decisions. ( Grunting ) Resist, Morty! Resist before he burns us out! Oh, too late now! What s wrong, Rick? Don t you want to see how your story ends?! ( laughs )  266a  266a ( All shouting ) Holy shit, Rick. What do we... There... there... There s now way out! You re right, Morty. Sometimes it does seem like there s no way out. Like it s hopeless. But remember, there s always someone there for us. Who? My best friend and personal savior, Jesus Christ. What?! You... you don t believe in God. But he believes in us, Morty. You know, I thought I was the inventor, but the greatest invention of all is the free gift of eternal life. Is this... Are you fucking with me? ( Chuckles ) Oh, trust me, Morty. I ve done plenty of effed up stuff in my life. But it s never too late to accept Christ. Jesus is always knocking at the door. All we have to do is open it and let him into our hearts. How? I m so glad you asked, Morty. Just close your eyes and go to him in prayer. Like this. Heavenly father. Heavenly father. Together: Thank you for sending your only begotten son. What a second, no! What are you doing?! Jesus, I accept you into my heart. No! This sucks. Stop! You guys would never do this. Together: Fill me with your spirit. Make me a shining city on a hill for you. No! No! No, no, no. Make me born again. No! In Jesus  name, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen! You did it! Way to go, Morty! Crossy. Bible-saurus. You made it. We wouldn t miss this for anything! You said it, Mr. Celery. What the fuck is all of this?! Greatest story ever told, story lord. No, it s not. It s awful! ( Whooshing ) I beg your pardon? Ah! Goddamn. ( All gasping ) My lord and my God! No! No! It sucks in here. Let s get the fuck outta here. Go, now. Ugh. We re safe, Morty. Nobody ever wanted to see that shit. Wh-what s gonna happen to story lord? He gets to spend eternity in every writer s hell... The Bible. I don t know. Some people actually like that stuff. Seems kind of cynical. I just don t like taking cheap shots, you know? Cheap shots? Morty, we were literally Saved by Jesus Christ. Tell me in any way how that s offensive. This was a little confusing, But I guess it brought us closer together, you know? Tested our demons. Made us believe in ourselves more than ever. Yeah. You re right, Morty. We got all that meta-canon shit outta the way And now we can just be ourselves. Now what do you say we bring this train into the station.  266a  266a Oh, shit. Morty: So what do you think? Wow. Where did you get this thing? The citadel of Ricks gift shop. Do you really like it? I didn t think you d even care. What? Morty. No. I love it. You did the most important thing. You... you bought something. What? You bought something. With money. God. I love money so much, Morty. Are you being sarcastic? Merchandise, Morty. Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise. And you did it. You went into a store... an actual honest to God store... And you bought something. You didn t ask questions or raise ethical complaints. You... you just looked straight into the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said \""yes, daddy, please.\"" And I m... I m so proud of you. I only wish you could ve bought more. I... I love buying things so much, Morty. Rick, are... are you... Do you need to go to the hospital? I love you, Morty. Give grandpa a kiss. Give... give... gimme... Give grandpa a kiss. Lips if you want. What... whatever you re comfortable with. Some cultures do that. That was sweet. Thank you. I... I love you. You re my little buddy. Okay. Let s watch some interdimensional cable. ( Television clicks, static crackles ) ( Train whistle blows ) So you re saying my father And his kingdom... Well, yes... it s based on the fusion of a sumerian God named \""ya\"" And a mesopotamian God named \""way.\"" And we re in a toy train? Yes. It s enough to really make you question All of existence, isn t it? So what do you think you re gonna do about it? I m gonna do what I ve always done. I m gonna get the fuck outta here. Father of omens! Give me blood beyond sight! ( Crackling ) Hey, what the fuck, Morty? The train you got me just completely derailed itself. There s blood all over the windows on it. Oh, man, I m sorry, Rick. I guess I ll return it. Return... Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty. Consume, Morty. Nobody s out there shopping with this fucking virus. Where s your fucking wallet?!  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a  Rick: Tired of the same boring adventures With your dogshit Morty?  Yeah!  Aw. Geez.  Then get ready for the citadel of Rick s story train.  Deep voice: Story train. Story train.  Rick: The citadel of Rick s story train Comes with car after car of enemies, lovers, and goomby, all grappling with the nature of who you truly are. Rick is a God! Tickets please. Whoa! Watch out! It s story lord! Damn. He s jacked. Deep voice: Pure cum gutter. Rick: And of course, what story would be complete without the engineer of the greatest story ever told. Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus: I have come not to judge The world, but to save it. Rick: And the best part is, the fun never ends. Thanks to the Rick-patented anthology generator, You ll never run out of new stories And people to tell them. Are they alive? Of course. But not in any ways that matter. Deep voice: They. Have. No. Souls. Puppets. Of. Fate. Rick: The story train. Available now. In the citadel of Ricks Buy it ironically. Buy it sincerely. Just buy it. Not buying it is an act of buying it. Buy it now. Look it up. It s real. Www.Story-train.Com. On the Internet. It s there. Buy it. Buy the train. We want you to buy the train. [[Category:Transcripts]]""}]}}}"

Rick immediately understands the situation and kills their respective facehuggers. Neither know how they got to that point and Rick is dismissive of the parasitic alien species. That is, until they spot a shockingly developed city.  While trying to find Rick's car ship, they find out that Morty's facehugger was a celebrated leader, while Rick's was a political-soapbox-YouTuber that was largely looked down on contemptuously by the alien society.   The two find the car tied to a freight ship that would drop loads of the alien eggs on Earth. While they had originally tried to make a clean escape using the corpses of their facehuggers as disguises, they are quickly seen through. Rick and Morty manage to leave the planet after causing devestating destruction to the city and its people.   The two are in a good mood, high off of guilt-free murder. As they enjoy breakfast, Beth asks about Summer. The two stutteringly make excuses and head back to the planet to look for Summer who they'd completely forgotten about.   After causing more mayhem, the two find her being waited on and worshipped by the aliens. After having them arrested Summer goes to their prison cell and explains what happened after Rick and Morty stupidly got close to the facehugger eggs and got possessed. Summer, who's new \""thing\"" was chewing on a toothpick, killed whatever facehugger tried to jump on her. She finds out that the facehuggers generally only lived about half an hour before laying eggs in their hosts and died an explosive death. Using that to her advantage, she reasonably coaxes a new way of life, where they didn't all have to die just for the sake of laying eggs.   Summer quickly becomes their ruler and appoints Morty's facehugger, Steve, as their inspired leader. Rick's facehugger, Bruce, grows jealous and leaves their growing government to make those anti-politic online videos. As things are going well, Steve and Summer chat in a friendly manner before she brings up freeing her brother. Steve realizes that all Summer wants is her family back and goes to Bruce to rant and complain.   Bruce resentfully gives Steve an I-told-you-so, but Steve is exasperated with his social stance against their species' progressive life. Bruce angrily explodes that he was angry that Summer had taken away Bruce; revealing his jealousy.  {{Quote|'''Steve:''' Why do you hate her so much?!<br>'''Bruce:''' Because she took you away from me!}}  Although awkward at first, the two makeup with a sizzling kiss and plan to runaway together. That's when Rick and Morty were freed.   Her story done, Rick and Morty are a little bewildered that Summer would know how that second half of the story went, but she dismissively waves it off. Everyone around the office knew about Steve and Bruce.   Summer's plan for escape is sentencing the two to death... by way of leaving in Rick's car. And of course, Summer had to go with them to make sure they died. The facehugger society is not stupid however and catches on that they're all just trying to escape. When they were jailed, Rick and Morty discover that Morty's terrible harmonica playing causes the aliens to combust. So, using the car's speakers they massacre even more of the aliens before finally leaving the planet.   When they reach home, Summer goes back to her room and Rick and Morty retire to the living room. For a moment they believe the aliens really had laid eggs in them and they were going to explode. But it just turned out that they both just actually shitted theirselves  After the end credits, [[Tricia Lange|Tricia]] watches Jerry keeping bees in the garden from Summers bedroom window, after she increasingly implies she\u2019s sexually attracted to him to Summer, she finally says she wants to have sex with him to a bored and annoyed Summer; who sarcastically responds \""Oh, ''really?''\"". ","- Aah, aah! - [SCREECHES]  Oh, my God. Holy [BLEEP]. - Oh. - What are... What are these things?! Do I look like I know? Last thing I remember, I was, ugh, in a cave looking at some wet egg and... Oh, that probably did it. I told you not to look at that egg! I-It was too wet. You don't get to tell me what to look at. I've seen your Pornhub account. Also, who makes a Pornhub account? The algorithm learns your preferences better that way. Plus if you get in kind of a cool enough relationship, you can sort of follow each other and check out each other's kinks, you know? All right, God damn, sold. - How do we get out of here? - Morty, relax. They're face-hugging parasites. I don't think their society's gonna be that hard to navigate. Okay, yeah, this might be a little harder than I thought. Holy [BLEEP] They've got an M&M's store. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ This is bad, Rick. Th-Th-Th-Th-This is really bad. Just be cool, Morty. All we gotta do is blend in, find our ship, and get the [BLEEP] outta here. All right, Morty, here's the plan, put this back on your face. I-I'm not putting that back on my face! - Relax. It's dead. - [SCREECHES] Okay, now it's dead. Come on, hurry up. Rick, i-it's bleeding. I-It's bleeding acid. All right, well, that should be the last of it. If not, then just gimme two tugs on the arm. [SCREAMS] Seems like a self-destructive life cycle. Is that gonna happen to us? You feel an egg in your stomach? - No. - Well, glass half full. - How's it going? - 'Sup. - Glory to Glorzo. - Totally. Love Glorzo. Glorzo is peace. Peace is Glorzo. Wow, just cogs in the machine, y'know? - Ma-Makes you think... - Yeah, I'm sure you'll make this into a beautiful short film that your parents'll pay for, Morty, but right now, we really just need to find my ship.

During the flight, Morty mentions that Rick might be setting him up for a double-cross. Morty seems done with Rick's shenanigans. Rick tells Morty that they don't have to worry - and as a last ditch effort, if things \""go wrong\"", that he's got a plan, and tells Morty to leap into the same vat of acid he does. Morty still complains, and says he should be doing English homework. However, Rick doesn't budge and resumes the ride.  Rick meets up with some intergalactic barters who he trades with. All seems well until the dealer tells Rick he's been duped, and that they successfully scammed Rick. Angered by this, Rick forms a third arm and shoots a dealer in the head. However, still held at gunpoint, Rick and Morty are forced to jump in the vat of fake acid that he prepared in advance. Rick and Morty sink to the bottom of the vat of acid, and open up predetermined hatches in order to trick the dealers into thinking that they died. The dealer and his cronies take time to watch the bones settle. They are in shock that a grandfather would commit suicide with his grandson, and mourn over Morty's death. Rick and Morty lie in wait at the bottom of the vat, until the dealer and his cronies vanish. Morty begins to get impatient after an extended period of time, as the dealers take the time for self-reflection and then decide of the bones, and takes it upon himself to rise out of the acid and kill the dealers. He misfires, and Rick takes the gun from him and kills all of the cronies. They then make a getaway.  Morty begins to get mad at Rick's faulty plan, and that Rick should be more open-minded instead of falling back on himself all of the time. Rick argues that he was able to handle things all by himself when he was turned into a pickle, and that Morty's adventure with the dragon was a total disaster. Morty then waves the fact that Rick likes to ignore most ideas Morty pitches over his head. As the argument escalates, it turns out that Rick has already refused Morty's request for a device that would allow him to save a point in time (like that of a video game), so that Morty can visit said time restarts. Rick, in a fit of rage, reluctantly agrees. Shortly after, Rick admits that he actually is unable to make said device, and proceeds to shoot Morty. After being shot Morty is still breathing - suggesting he was stunned - however, Rick triggers the device creating the first time stamp and encourages an oblivious Morty to have fun with the device.  Over the next few weeks, Morty has a lot of fun with his time-saving device - including pulling his teacher's pants down, talking to his love interest Jessica, avoiding embarrassing moments, rectifying bad decisions and saving himself from death. One day, he activates the time save before approaching a girl outside of a coffee shop to talk to her. They get along well and go on a date, which leads to a long-term relationship. Morty and his (unnamed) girlfriend go through many ups and down over the following months, and even break-up at one point, but emerge stronger than ever. The two go on vacation together, but the plane they boarded on crashes and they get stranded on a mountain range. They are forced to resort to cannibalism to stay alive, and Morty starts trekking across the mountains to retrieve his backpack. Although he finds the time-save device, Morty decides not activate it, and uses his frost-bitten hands to call for a rescue. He is saved just in time, and after an extended stay in hospital Morty and his girlfriend fully recover from their ordeal. At their welcome home party, Morty and his girlfriend are happier and stronger than ever... until Jerry mistakes the time-save device for the TV remote and hits the buttons, 'restoring' Morty's save point back to before he approached his girlfriend. He tries to approach her again, but gets pepper-sprayed in the face for his troubles. In his pain, he falls on the time-save device and saves that point, leaving him unable to go back and try again.  Depressed that the time-save has only made him more miserable, Morty throws himself to a bunch of gorillas at the local zoo a few times. Finally he goes to see Rick, sick and tired of restarting time, and decides to take these experiences as an opportunity to face the consequences of his actions.   Rick however lets Morty know that his previous actions did, in fact, have consequences. Stating that he has never believed in time travel, reveals to Morty that the boy didn't perform any \""do-overs\"", but rather \""did it, over and over\"". Showing a recording of one of these \""do-overs\"", Rick shows that all the \""time resets\"" were actually different probabilities of him all along. This caused the death of numerous Morty's, moving the present Morty in their place, not unlike the movie ''Prestige''. Disgusted with his actions, Morty is in a state of despair, as he doesn't know what to do or how to fix the mess he caused. Rick suggests that he can fuse all of his alternate selves and their respective universes. Fed up, Morty complies and Rick reveals that he is not Morty's original Rick but another Rick who says all Ricks have a vat of acid. He then merges the universes together and returns Morty to the first save point with his Rick. All of a sudden, a bunch of law enforcement members and protesters appear outside of Rick's garage, with anti-Morty posters (consequences of his actions in the other universes). Morty is terrified and confused, however Rick is determined to make Morty learn his lesson and tells him to jump into the fake vat of acid he's set up. Grumbling, Morty does so (just as his previous girlfriend arrives, only to leave in tears upon seeing Morty go into the acid) and hides at the bottom releasing fake bones just like he did before. Satisfied, and feeling a bit guilty, everybody vacates the premises except for the two cops. The cops seem to doubt Morty's death and drop a ladle in, and Morty's attempt to blow it up results in him accidentally shooting the cop in two and splashing his partner with the fake acid. The remaining cop, instead of coming to the logical conclusion, believes he's immune to acid and leaves happily after insulting and exposing himself to his dead partner. Rick is satisfied Morty has learned something: to \""never make fun of him again, ''ever''\"", and decides to head home (saying he wouldn't waste their home reality on this crap) lamenting that the reality they're in was nice, as Johnny Carson was still alive and on the air, 9/11 never happened and Rocky Road ice cream had peanut butter instead of marshmallows.  In the post-credits scene, the surviving cop goes on Johnny Carson's show proclaiming that he is immune to acid. He is lowered into a genuine vat, where he suffers a slow and painful death.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Mustached Goon: Should we drop our buddy in here before we go?  Lead Gangster: Yeah, probabbly a good idea.  [Rick prepares to open the trapdoor with spare bones.  Mustached Goon: Should we use a different vat? Does acid lose its acid power the more it dissolves?  Black Coat Goon: What am I, an Acidologist? Here grab that rat-like creature. We ll do a little test.  [Rick grabs a bone, takes his knife and carves rat bones then gives it to Morty to hold on to]   Lead Gangster: Look, if you the damn acid, don t use a rat. Take that ladle, grab a spoonful and put it in the analyzer.  [A ladle goes on the vat to take a sample, and Rick shoots it. When the Gangsters take it out, they shout in surprise]  Lead Gangster: I d say that s pretty acidy, drop him in.  [A rat is thrown in to the vat, suprising Rick as he barely opens the trapdoor with Morty trying to close it as Rick shift his focus on the rat]   Lead Gangster: What are you doing?  Mustached Goon: You said-  Lead Gangster: Not the rat, the guy.  [Rick cathes the rat but Morty is unable to close the door, allowing the spare bones to release]  Mustached Goon: Ohhh!  [Rick tries to kill the rat but Morty pulls the rat to him then gives his air tube]  Lead Gangster: Look at the size of the bones on that rat.  Mustached Goon: Oh, how many sets of bones this rat got?  Black Coat Goon: Look how the smaller ones are shaped, their like little cartoon bones. Like if you dreaw a bone in art class.  Lead Gangster: Alright that tears it, I m cancelling of the rest of my night and calling a bone scientist. We re getting to the bottom of this-  [Morty goes to the surface with a rat and a lazer gun in his hand]  Morty: Jesus Fucking Chist enough already!  [Morty then throws the rat at them then shoots the leader to no affect, Rick then comes up, takes the gun from Morty and adjust the setting then kills all of them. Morty then jumps out of the vat and collets all of the red crystals to put in the suitcase then they madly look at each other]  Morty; Can we go?

Rick: Because you ruined it!  Morty: It was pre-ruined!  Rick: Oh was it worse than when I was a pickle? Oh-oh-oh, that s right, you weren t there for that, turns out kind of cool. Maybe there s a connection there  Morty: Excuse me?  Rick: What s that cool thing you did without me again? The awesome thing? I-I-I guess you wanted a dragon?   *Does a chef s kiss    Unforgettable.

It s about execution.  [Morty shuts the door then Ricks works on his gadgets, until Morty comes back]  Morty: No such thing as a bad idea except all of mine, right?  Rick: Morty, wanting a dragon isn t an idea.   Morty: I m not talking about that! I m constantly pitching you ideas, Rick, and you act like they re not even worth thinking about.  Rick: What, the helicopter lawn chair? That s just something you saw on TV.  Morty: What about my video-game-style place-saving device?  Rick: Oh my God, here we go.  Morty: It s a good idea, Rick! A device that lets you-  Rick: Save your place like in a video game but in real life so that you can try stuff and then go back to your save point, yes Morty, I saw it on \""Futurama.\""  Morty: Oh, so you don t do anything unless it s original?

Do you have any idea how much fucking work would have to go into a machine that-  Morty: Ah-ha! You can t do it.  Rick: I can do anything, Morty. Your idea is not worth doing.  Morty: You can t do it.  Rick: Before what you re trying to do was called \""negging,\"" it was called \""reverse psychology\"" and incels didn t incent it, Bugs Bunny did.  Morty: You can t do it.

During the drive, Rick gets a call from an ex telling him he is the father of her children. Beth, determined that Rick will do for his new child what he never did for her, forces him to go to his ex and be a good dad. However it turns out that Rick's ex, Gaia, is an entire planet about to give birth to her first sentient species. Beth wants Rick to help the kids develop, and Rick agrees so the two of them set to work developing the society and helping them fly into space.  Morty, Summer and Jerry go camping, but Morty and Summer make it clear they have no intention of going along with Jerry's camping trip. After Summer verbally blasts Jerry for wanting to bond with her in order to feel important, he leaves forlorn and accidentally gets thrown into a group of Rick and Beth's new society's rejects. With their basic brains, they love the idea of camping, so Jerry becomes their new leader. Morty and Summer go looking for him after a few days, only to find a crashed alien ship. Boarding it, Morty believes the controls are identical to his video game while Summer thinks the vapor the ship emits will grant her knowledge of how the controls and begins inhaling it. Soon she gets high off of the substance, and Morty tries to fly the ship. Meanwhile, a god-like being named Reggie arrives claiming he is the father of the children that Beth and Rick raised, and Gaia admits to Rick she made a mistake and doesn't know who the father is. Rick and Reggie both want to lay claim to the offspring, and quickly get into a fight. After a long brawl, Reggie gets the upper hand and tells Rick he has no intention of raising his kids but simply wants to strike the fear of god (who, as far as he is concerned, is himself) into them. However before Reggie can kill Rick, Morty and Summer dispatch him by accidentally driving the spaceship through his brain. Boarding, Rick finds Morty and Summer high, and thanks them for saving his life. Rick tells them that video games and drugs are the best, although also points out Summer wasn't actually doing drugs, but rather - inhaling brake fluid. Rick soon inhales the brake fluid.    While all this is going on, Beth's advanced Ricklets and Jerry's tribal Ricklets have gone to war with each other. However before the battle can go too far, Reggie's body falls on the city destroying it and killing many of the residents. Beth is sent flying over a cliff, and its left to Jerry to save her. He manages it, however the smell he now emits quickly quells any thought of thanking him for the rescue. Gaia is furious that her mate has been killed and forms an erupting volcano, the resulting lava killing most of the surviving society. Rick, Morty and Summer pick up Beth, Jerry and the last few survivors and fly off. The family finally leaves in their car, and gives the ship to the Ricklets (which Rick placing a tracer and a bomb on board, planning to blow it up if they come near Earth seeking revenge).   As the family flies off, Jerry reveals that he has learned a lesson from the experience, and tells the kids they were right about him, as he admits that he wanted to feel important, something that left Summer and Morty shocked. Jerry says there are times, where teenagers do have a point even if they are cruel, leaving the kids to feel guilty at their treatment. After Rick insults Jerry, Beth for once doesn't defend her father - and instead takes her husband's defense by voicing how Jerry saved her life, while criticizing Rick. This brings a smile to Jerry's face, and as Rick observes Jerry's smug look, Rick takes the opportunity to put them in their place and reassert control - telling Jerry and Beth they need to work on their parenting skills as Morty and Summer got high, went joyriding and killed Reggie. Beth and Jerry appear to be shocked and displeased that Rick is ratting out their kids who are equally shocked until listening to criticism.  In the post-credits scene, Summer catches Rick looking at what appears to be a dating/porn website for planets. Although Rick claims he's only looking at it for the comedic potential, he's clearly aroused by what he sees.","[SIGH] What kind of parents drag their kids away for the entire week of spring break? I'm missing Mike Triscuit's drug party. Look at this. He's already watching ""Euphoria"" to pregame. Pregame. Game. Video game. Yes, yes, drugs and video games. Poor babies. What you need is to level up with a bong rip of nature. Trust me, this is good for you. - Can someone just k*ll me? - [VIDEO GAME BEEPING] Grandpa Rick, you can k*ll anything. No, he can't, Summer. We're roughing it. And that means no sci-fi bull-[BLEEP]. - Isn't that right, Rick? - Uh-huh. [CELLPHONE BUZZES] Rick, was that a sci-fi phone call? Shut up, Jerry. Damn it, I didn't think she had this number. Why are you building a Faraday box to block out the signal? Oh, my God, Grandpa's ghosting someone. I'm not ghosting. Hey! Give it back, Summer! ""Rick. Please answer me. I'm pregnant""?! Oh, my God, Grandpa, you [BLEEP] boi. I'm not a [BLEEP] boi [BURPS], Summer! - There's no way those kids are mine. - Wow. At least we know why Rick actually came on the trip... - to avoid his [BLEEP]-guy problems. - Why would this person lie? I don't know, honey. She's addicted to what the Rick did. You know, it's... it's... it's a tale as old as my huge dynamite penis. Can we turn the radio on? I am not letting you abandon those kids - like you abandoned me. - Oh, my God! We're going to see this baby mama right now! What, like, literally now? - Yes, now! That's an order. - [GROANS] Aah! No! This is exactly what I was talking about! Rick, I hope you realize the tubing permit was non-refundable! Relax, Jerry, we'll be in and out in a minute, and then you can get right back to your dumb vacation with a family that doesn't need you. Kind of expected someone to defend me, but, sure, okay. Hello, Gaia. Hold on. Let me just adjust my Seismic-to-English translator. GAIA: Rick. You came. - MORTY: W-Where is she? - RICK: You're looking at her. I-I-I-I don't understand.

What's the problem? Children. Birth cycle. Now. Okay, gettin' right into it. - I am! I am! - Jesus Christ! - I am! - I am! I am! Dad, do something! Make it stop! You think I know how to stop this? I thought she was gonna shit an egg. Cool vacation, guys. So happy I got to see the human geyser instead of micro-dosing with my friends. More coming. Kids. Need father. Yeah, um, Baby Quakes, how big is your orbit again? I mean, not to say you get around, but, um... Are you kidding me? Look at them! They look just like you. Yeah, and snakes look like dildos, Beth. - What's your point? - They do? The fact is even if they were mine, which they're not, the best parent is evolution. They'll probably develop harder skin or maybe even webbed arms. Man, that'd be cool, huh? Flying squirrel people? Yeah, Dad, that approach worked out great for me. Beth, I know it looks bad, but trust me. This is life in the galaxy, okay? It's totally normal. Fine. You won't do something, I will. Welp, there goes the surprise! I was gonna have us jump on the trampoline - after we caught our first fish. - I am! What? You're stupid. - I am! - I am! I am! - Beth, that's not gonna help. - Uh, I hate to agree with Rick, but shouldn't we just let this be? We're supposed to be on vacation. You're unemployed, Jerry! Every day is a vacation for you. - Okay, ouch. - You guys do whatever you want. I'm staying here and fixing this. - I am! - I am! g*dd*mn it, Beth, if you're gonna do it, at least do it right. Gaia, baby, gonna need a little raw iron and steam. Whatever you need, baby. [BEEP] [WHIRRING] - So much for camping. - Nope. We are going camping. There's trees over there. - We're on solid ground. - SUMMER AND MORTY: Mom! Summer, Morty, go camp with your father. - Ohh, son of a bitch. - Son of a bitch. - I am! - I am! - I am! - Welp, welcome to lack of abandonment. Dad, can we please go back and hang out with Grandpa's clay people? Why? Because they might have a Sega Dreamcast? Why is it so hard for you two to let nature in? Because this sucks ass. Camping is just being homeless without the change. Well, that attitude is exactly why we're out here. You guys wouldn't last two seconds on your own. You're only happy when you're penned in and drugged up like some kind of chicken or lemur. Hey! I told you kids no phones! There's not even any service. Just... Just let us be happy for a minute. You know, maybe if you two stopped whining and let your old man take the reins, you might actually learn something. Here. Take a bite of this tasty treat. Oh, you think this s'more makes you special? What? Because someone said, ""good job,"" to you once when you were ? That's actually really sad, Dad. Let's be real. You've been high-roading us non-stop, forcing us to do nothing in the middle of [BLEEP] nowhere because it's the only way you're gonna level the playing field, isn't it?

It's a comedic premise. - Yeah. - Planets Only. Planets Only.

Beth quickly ended most of them leaving one guard alive. She told the guard her name and tells him to say that the Defiance lives on to the top bugs. The bug guard agrees ensuring that he would make her a legend although it was making it difficult for him to construct such an idea since Beth's name is so plain. The bug guards then forgets Beth's name but then Beth kills him.  The next scene appears to be a secret base where Beth is stationed. Beth is being repaired on her shoulder while watching an ad about a planet-destroying machine. The doctor who is repairing Beth's arm tells Beth if she ever missed Earth. Beth tells him that she's aware that there was a clone of her on Earth making her \""technically\"" there. The doctor points out that Beth had a proximity device in her neck. He thinks that the bomb indicated that Rick didn't actually want Beth back and that he liked the clone better. He then offers Beth a drug to help her with her \""soul-crushing\"" but it was addictive. But he swaps out for the correct one and then he eats one.  Now back on Earth, Beth is talking about Dr. Wong being open for family therapy. Rick then tries to act as if he was disintegrated but Morty points out that Rick simply used an invisibility belt. Jerry proves this by grabbing Rick's crouch causing Rick to uncloak. Morty says that he wanted to use the belt even though Rick never let him. Summer pitched in saying that if she can use the belt to piss of Morty. Rick gives Summer the belt with a smug look towards Morty. Summer turns invisible as Morty tries to take it from Summer. Beth stops Morty and says that both Summer and Morty should share it. Jerry enters with a puppet \""Mr. Nibbles\"". Morty then runs to catch Summer as she leaves the front door. Rick says to both Jerry and Beth that they can't control their kids and that it was a good thing Dr. Wong was available. Rick leaves the scene and enters into his garage where he commanded the garage into \""Family Therapy Mode\"".  The garage seals all openings with lasers and doors. However, the other version of Beth stands before Rick. Space Beth attacks Rick explains that the Beth on Earth has a similar device in her neck meant to transfer her Memories to space Beth and that Earth Beth is the clone. Space Beth is confused about why her clone got back together with Jerry, but Rick explains that, as they are the same person, she would have done the same thing. The two then decide to get a drink.  Meanwhile, Summer uses the invisibility belt to break into a boy's room and go through his stuff, however, Morty stops and confronts her wearing a pair of infrared goggles. The two wrestle for a short time before managing to switch tech. Morty is going to leave with the belt, but Summer reveals that she knows that Morty is planning to go to cheerleading practice and can catch him in the act. Morty asks summer for a deal, with her saying that he can have the belt in an hour. He agrees and hands her the belt, but instead of giving him the goggles, Summer she smashes them before mocking Morty, only for him to reveal that he gave her his \""Tiny Big Man Junior\"" belt instead of the invisibility one. Morty then proceeds to turn invisible before leaving, leaving Summer to confront the boy whose room she broke into. Summer lies to the boy about having wandered away from her game console.  Rick and Space Beth converse at Shoney's, with Beth talking about her adventures and Rick pointing out how they seem similar to Star Wars. In turn, Beth brags about how she has become the most wanted person in the universe, much to Rick's surprise. The two are interrupted when they see a television report about the New Galactic Federation looking for Beth. Realizing that they would find Earth Beth, Rick lets it slip that Earth Beth might not be the clone. Space Beth attempts to shoot Rick, but he freezes her.  At the school, Morty uses the invisibility belt to try and peek on the cheerleaders in the shower, but Summer, knowing he would be there, pulls the fire alarm and sprays a fire extinguisher, coating Morty in the foam. Morty runs into the football field, and tries to clean himself off, Summer uses the opportunity to steal the belt and turn invisible. Morty tries to use the fire extinguisher on her, but it turns out to be empty. A New Galactic Federation ship then approaches, causing Morty to drop the fire extinguisher. Morty is about to be arrested, but a still invisible Summer picks up the fire extinguisher. Surprised the federation agents ask if Morty psychic, to which he lies and says yes. They explain they are looking for his mother and then ask of Morty can stop their hearts. Morty lies again, saying he can, and the agents then surrender without a fight.  Meanwhile, Dr. Wong chastises Jerry's obsession with puppets as it makes him look dumb and crazy. Suddenly, the room explodes as Tammy and a team of Galactic Federation troopers storm the building with the intent of gong after Beth. While Tammy wants to kill Beth, she's under orders by her superiors to bring her in and arrest her for her defiance. Beth doesn't understand what Tammy means, but after seeing Space Beth's battle, she realizes that she's the clone all along. Suddenly, Rick arrives and has his smart guns kill everybody but the humans inside the building, including, to his reluctance, Dr. Wong. While Tammy holds Beth prisoner, Rick reveals that he added a lot of contingency plans inside the office, using one to burn Tammy alive before shooting her. Rick takes Jerry and Beth in his ship and flies away.  As the trio fly, they are followed by Space Beth and Galactic Federation ships. While Jerry suggests that Rick make a portal for safety, the latter refuses to as Morty and Summer are still out there invisible, before calling him a bad father. However, Beth calls Rick out on his hypocritical statement as he lied to her about being a clone, only for the latter to hesitatingly claim that Space Beth is the clone as Beth refused to leave, and he liked the idea of having a space daughter. Tired of being lied to, Beth crashes Rick's ship so she can speak with Space Beth, with both versions accusing the other of being the clone. Before Space Beth can kill Beth, a burned Tammy and a squad of Galactic Federation troopers surround them. Rather than decide which is which, Tammy simply has both Beths taken away on a NX-5 Planet Remover. Rick tries to sacrifice himself as he believes the Galactic Federation still thinks he's a high-value target, but Tammy reveals that the new leaders do not deem him that anymore as they know he could simply move to a new dimension when left alone. Suddenly, Tammy's gun is pulled away from her, and Morty, in a Galactic Federation ship, fires at the troopers. He reveals to Rick that he and Summer, who is invisible right now, have put aside their differences and are working together as part of their \""arc\"". After an invisible Summer takes Tammy down, Rick shoots her in the head as payback for making him go to a wedding, along with killing Birdperson which he realized should have been the first thing he said. However, the NX-5 begins to destroy the Earth, with a pissed and reluctant Rick realizing they have to do a \""Star Wars\"" in order to rescue Beth.  Rick and the family land in the NX-5's hanger bay and use Tammy's corpse to unlock the door to the main hallway. While Rick goes off to find Beth, he tells Morty and Summer to stop the NX-5 from destroying the city. However, the siblings are forced to leave without the invisibility belt as Jerry is using it to pee, but Morty is certain that they don't need it.  In their prison cell, the Beths wonder what their fate will be as Earth Beth feels she's the clone to Space Beth. After the two trade insults over their decisions on who they became, Rick announces to on the PA that he's coming to save one of the Beths if they are alive, but if they're both alive, then he suggests that they do not hurt each other as anyone of them could be the clone. Now realizing what a piece of shit father Rick is, the Beths escape their prison cell.  Rick enters a fight chamber and sees his old friend Birdperson, now Phoenixperson, come out to face him. Although dishearten to see his old friend now on the Galactic Federation's side, he tries to calm Phoenixperson by saying that he killed Tammy. However, Phoenixperson is not happy with this news as he loved Tammy, and the two begin fighting each other.  Meanwhile, Morty and Summer find the laser controls, only to see two Galactic Federation troopers guarding it. They see that the NX-5 cannons are unable to destroy Wrangler jeans due to their sponsorship, which gives Morty and Summer an idea. Meanwhile, Rick and Phoenixperson continue their fight, but Rick starts to get overwhelmed by the latter.  Elsewhere, the two Beths work together and fight their way through Galactic Federation troopers to reach Rick. Back at the cannon station, Morty distracts the two guards by running past the doorway, leading them out of the room. That gives Summer the chance to go in and toss Morty's Wrangler jeans into the laser well, and the computer shuts down because of it. Morty comes back after killing the two guards off-screen, but Summer is disgusted to have seen her brother's balls.  Meanwhile, Rick and Phoenixperson's fight goes outside, with the former getting blasted at and having his cybernetic guts ooze out of his body. Before Phoenixperson can kill Rick, the Beths arrive to help him, or at least kick his ass before he dies. However, it's not enough as Phoenixperson knocks the Beths out of the way before stomping on Rick's organs. Suddenly, Jerry comes out invisible and uses Tammy's corpse as a puppet, claiming that Rick lied about killing her, distracting Phoennixperson. While Jerry trips up and goes visible, his actions were long enough for Space Beth to shut off Phoenixperson. Afterwards, Morty and Summer come and see their two mothers.  Back at home, the Smith family is okay with the idea of having two Beths as the kids like the idea of having two moms, and Jerry likes the idea of having two wives. However, Rick has a projector ready to reveal who the real Beth is, and shows that he mind-blew his memory of the reveal. That upsets the Beths even more as they now realize how much of a piece of shit Rick is, and refuse to look at the memory, claiming they don't need anything from Rick before leaving. Rick tries to entice Morty and Summer into seeing it, but they are not interested either as both Beths are badass and it's a win-win. Regardless, Rick puts the memory into the projector and watches the memory.  It turns out that after giving Beth the choice of staying on Earth or going off on her own, she asks Rick to make the choice for her as she wants to know what he really wants. Rick ends up making a clone of Beth and copies her memories into the clone, but then, he turns his back to the containers and has a machine randomize the Beth's so he could not tell who was who.  After seeing this, Rick despondently realizes that he's a terrible father, before looking at the pieces of Phoenixperson, having recovered his old friend from the NX-5. However, Phoenixperson is still hostile towards Rick, forcing the latter to turn off his friend. Afterwards, Rick sits down, despondent that his actions have driven himself further from his family more than ever.  In the post-credits scene, Jerry throws Rick's invisibility belt in the trash, only for it to turn the garbage truck invisible when it picks up the trash. A rich man then arrives driving his fast car and, despite Jerry's warnings, crashes into the invisible truck. Though he is glad that he survived, the car then explodes, killing him and causing the truck's drivers to flee terrified. Jerry proceeds to claim the invisible truck for himself, and becomes a vigilante, performing several \""heroic\"" feats, such as saving a prostitute from a pimp. However, when the truck runs out of gas, Jerry is forced to abandon it at a gas station, having been unable to find its fuel tank.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

I ll hold them off. ( Screaming, zapping ) My name is Beth Smith. Tell your top bugs the Defiance lives on. I will. I will. I ll make you a legend. Blade Smith. Beth Smith. Beth. Beth. Beth Smith. Okay, God, it s just such a plain... I m trying to come up with a mnemonic device. You could connect it to not dying. I know, I know! You think that would sear it right in, but it just speaks to the sheer forgettability. Oh, God. I-I-I m, uh, so sorry. Uh, uh, oh, God. Starts with a \""B\""... Congratulations to your government, business, or terror cell on its acquisition of the NX-5 Planet Remover by Xamaxax in partnership with Wrangler jeans. The NX-5 s industry-leading tachyon beams eliminate planets twice as fast as the NX-4S with half the battery and zero built-in fatal design flaws. That s right. No more secret hole that blows the whole thing up when you shoot it. Your enemies will say it s unfair. We say it s about time. Damn it. We risked our lives for that? You did your best. Maybe you need a break. Don t you ever miss Earth? I don t have to miss it. I m technically still there. My dad made a perfect clone of me to take my place. Boy, that Rick. So, if you do go back, what happens to the clone? Does it have, like, a proximity-triggered device in its neck? Who cares? Are we done? Sure. Unless you want me to remove the proximity-triggered device from your neck. Think it s a bomb? Man, what if this is how you found out he never wanted you back, that he loved the clone more than you? How crazy would that be? Crazy and of... of course soul-crushing. For you. I actually have something for that. Y-You want some? They re nonaddictive. That s not true. They re totally addictive. I m a terrible doctor. I actually have something for that, too. You want some? Nonaddictive. Mmm. I m a great doctor.  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a Dr. Wong had a cancellation today. Anybody up for a family session? I could do that. I m... I m down to clown. Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet will be done in time. Great, because she specifically asked you to stop bringing puppets. Dad? I love therapy, family therapy most of all, but I am actually disintegrating. Whoa! Oh, my God! Dad! Is that really it? We did it? It s the invisibility belt. Whoa-whoa-whoa! He grazed them. That s gonna hurt in like 10 seconds. Thanks, Morty. Why should I let you use it? You never let me use it. Can I have the belt? It would really piss off Morty. Fantastic idea. What the hell?! You jerk! Give it! Hey! Ow! Share the invisibility. Jerry? Ooh, this looks like a job for Mr. Nibbles. Let me just glue one more eye on. I m gonna kill you! Woof. Looks like you two have to fight about why you can t control your kids. Good thing Dr. Wong s got an opening. Bye. You re a bad father. Don t let him divide us. Garage, family therapy mode. Ah. Honey, you re back. You seem surprised. You never wrote. And never exploded? What I m hearing is that you think that s a bomb. So does every engineer that s seen it. Engineer? Princess, I m sure every caveman that sees a microwave calls it a rock cabinet. The point of inventing is to make things that don t exist. Then whip me up a reason not to kill you. Dad? We re off to Dr. Wong s. Scan her. Dad? Okay, have fun, pumpkin. Sorry I m a piece-of-shit father. Oh, ha-ha! Well, the self-loathing buys a lot back. Jerry, leave the puppet. Jerry: It s a one-way ticket to a breakthrough, Beth. The device in her neck would have transferred a database of her memories to your device before vaporizing her. So much for that plan. Why is she... it... why am I back with Jerry? I thought she was a copy of me. She is a copy of you. If she ran back to that dingleberry, that s on you. Want to grab a drink? All the time. Good girl. Ooh. ( Sniffing ) ( Beeping, whirring ) To catch a predator. What the hell?! Thermal goggles, bitch. Mom said share. You can t share invisibility. Take those off. ( Grunting ) No. So I ll just see you at cheerleader practice? Should I bring a poncho? All right! State your terms. Give back the belt. You take the goggles. Go away. We trade in an hour. Deal. ( Glass breaks ) How do you like that, bitch? I liked it more than my old belt. \""Tiny Big Man Junior\""? You shoulda shared. What are you doing in my house? Did I wander that far from my console? They should put a warning on these things. So, we overrode the gates, and the slave rebellion took the capital. Pretty cool. Very cool. My daughter, having space adventures. They are skewing a tad \""Star Wars\""-y, though. Don t forget to have fun. Well, I came back to murder you, not get your notes, but I ll remember to fart more while I m saving the galaxy. Okay, I m the one that made this possible. It s not a competition. Of course not. Just curious, though, if it were, would \""most wanted\"" be first place? You re fighting the Gromflomites? Dad, they re trying to take over the galaxy! Everybody in the galaxy tries to take over the galaxy. The trick is to be left alone by whoever succeeds. Eh, it s your hero phase. I had one, too. You ll outgrow it. No, you did. I m not gonna outgrow giving a ( Bleep ). Sources tell us these aliens, who call themselves the Neeeew Galactic Federation, will blow up the planet unless some woman with a very boring name gives herself up. Oh, come on. Way to give a ( Bleep ). Next time, don t wipe it on your home planet. Oh, ( Bleep ). They re gonna track down Beth. You mean... Beth s clone. Right. Beth s clone. What... What did I say? It really was nice seeing you again. Whoo! Yeah! Go, Honey Bees! Good practice, girls. And remember, we are in a drought, so be sure to shower as one big group at the exact same time. ( Alarm ringing ) Shower fire! The shower s on fire! Step aside, girls! I got this! ( Morty whimpering ) ( Alarm ringing within, morty whimpering ) ( Thud! ) You re a monster! Still wanna share? ( Whooshing ) Morty Smith, hands up. You are under arrest for crimes against the New Improved Galactic Federation. Wait. What? How are you doing that? You re not a psychic, are you? Do you have psychic powers? Uh, yes. Are they strong powers? We re just looking for your mother. You can t, like, stop our hearts, can you? Uh, I can. Okay, we surrender. Jerry, do you agree that the use of puppets makes you seem dumb and crazy? I don t think \""crazy\"" is a responsible word to use in... It is now. This is crazy. You re being crazy. They do it in therapy on TV. Well, TV gives British people prizes for baking, Jerry. ( Boom! ) ( Ominous music ) Tonya? Tammy? Tammya? Tammya. Hi, Mrs. Smith. I like your hair better this way. How s the stomach? What? Hey! I only said \""hey.\"" It s not like I can do more than that. As much as I d like to kill you, my superiors have some questions about the Defiance. I don t have a... I have a Defiance? Oh, God, I m a clone. That s your defense? No, my defense is eat me. Hey! Ah! We ve been over this. All I do is say \""hey.\"" Smart guns, white-list human life. And the therapist. ( Blasting ) Tammy, this is the office where my family works to better itself. What, and that makes it sacred? No, it makes it a place I ve rigged with a lot of voice-activated escape contingencies. ( Clears throat ) These are all good points. I need to take a long look at myself. Aah! Aah! I d like to discuss that. I don t discuss problems, I incinerate them. Everybody in the car. Everybody in my family, not the world. Jesus, Wong. Boundaries. I m better than this job.  266a  266a Can t you just make a portal? Your children are down there invisible, Jerry. \""Make a portal\""? Father of the year back here. Well, you re one to talk. You told me I wasn t a clone. Y-You re not a clone. And who is that? Uh, uh, a clone. Why would you make a clone of me just to send the clone into space? Well, you didn t want to go, and I thought, \""Okay, that s cool.\"" But then I thought, \""Well, you know what would be even cooler is a space daughter,\"" s-so I made one. And I put a bomb in her neck in case she ever came back. Father of the year. She wasn t supposed to come back. Why did she? Well, she found a bomb in her neck. Wouldn t you? Father of the year. Shut up! I m tired of believing you. I want to talk to her. No, you don t. Jerry, do something. Hey. He told me you re the clone. What do you think he told me? You re the clone? Wow, naive and attractive. Wow, jaded and hot. ( Rick grunting ) I know this is bad parenting, but if you stop fighting, you both get McDonald s. How about I just blow my brains out, starting with hers? Okay, Wendy s. We love Wendy s. I-I think they even gave us some money. Drop it. Don t move! Freeze! Get down! On the ground! On the ground! Don t move! Everybody, shut up! You re all saying different shit. Wait, so there are two of them? More importantly, which one is mine? Uh, neither, chauvinist. Whatever. Take them both.  266a  266a Cool beam. But let s bargain. I m the one you really want. Excuse me? Uh, smartest man in the universe? Secret to interdimensional travel? Ask your bosses. My bosses are bugs, Rick. You killed the old ones. The new ones are half my age. They know if you re left alone, you re a non-threat. Oofa! We got the payload. Fire up the NX-5. Earth s going Ta-ta. You might want to do that thing where you find a new universe where you can suck yourself off. You can t tell me what to do. Awesome. He resisted. We can shoot him. Wha? Just go with it, Jerry. Everybody, drop your guns... except for Jerry! Fucking classic. ( Whooshing, gunfire ) Holy shit. Morty. And Summer. W-We worked together. That s... that s our arc. Summer: We went from siblings to invisible to working together. It s not \""Citizen Kane,\"" but why compete with whatever s going on here, you know? Unh! ( Cracks ) Aah! You made me go to a wedding. And you killed my best friend. I shoulda said that one first. Congratulations, Earth, on being destroyed by the NX-5, brought to you by Wrangler. ( Zapping ) Ugh, guess the galaxy s most-wanted mammal needs her daddy to come change her diapie. Come on, kids, we have to go do a fucking piece of shit \""Star Wars.\"" Attention, Zeta 99-2. We know you have a stolen ship. Stand down. Oh, am I not a non-threat now? ( Splatting, grunting ) Hey, you are not cleared to land. We will open fire. Hold your ground, men. You ll be heroes. ( Splat! ) Summer, try unlocking that door by scanning your high-school friend s dead face. Uh, I have... I have to pee. Pee on the floor. It s a Death Star. Okay, but there s rebellion and then there s... Here, Dad. Perfect. ( Buzzing ) What am I doing wrong? Ugh, her eyes are closed. Morty, open the left one. I ve got the right. She died the way she lived, overserialized. I m gonna rescue your mom and her clone without revealing which is which. You two find the NX-5 and shut it down. I mean, don t die trying. There s infinite Earths. If you can save this one, it s gravy. Dream team rides again! Oh, yeah, we re like Luke and Leia. Uh, except no kissing part. What s another famous brother-sister team? Uh, Hansel and Gretel? Yeah, right, those two were fucking. Dad, we need the belt. I can t go with you guys watching. You re invisible. What if the pee isn t? You know what? We don t need invisibility. Working together is our belt. That s our arc. Let s do it. I m gonna go ahead and whistle. That s how good I feel. ( Whistling ) Oh, God. I knew it. Ugh, this floor isn t level.  266a  266a Are they gonna torture us? Unless you plan on telling them what I know. Last chance to guess who was the clone. You re his daughter. Just something about the eyes, the shameless abandonment of your family. However can I live with myself? One theory... I was designed by your father to live with myself, which would mean you made a conscious choice to swallow your dreams with cheap wine and dinosaur pasta. You know that s the kind Jerry likes, same way I know the only goddamn dream you ll ever follow is your shitty father s approval. You fetch your shitty father s lemonade. You cosplay as your shitty father in his 30s. Red alert. Red alert. Rick Sanchez... ( Choking ) Rick: More like dead alert. What else? What else? I wrote some stuff down in my Notes app. Let me just find it. Screw it. Beth, if... if one of you is still alive, you re my real daughter. If you re both alive, don t hurt the other one. She s just a clone. She s not worth it. I m coming, baby. That piece of shit. That piece of shit. I came back kill him, you know. I d like to help. Kick me between my eyes. From here? Oh, you dropped yoga so you could buy Jerry more Flintstones Vitam...  266a  266a Oh, I do not like the looks of this giant fight chamber. ( Gas hissing ) ( Footsteps thudding ) Bird Person? It is now Phoenix Person. You re working for them? What did they do to you, BP? It is now PP. Where is Tammy? Oh, don t worry about her. I killed her. I loved her. Really? Huh. Then can I suggest, as an alternate name, Crazy Pussy Whipped Person? Aah! ( Blasting ) Unh! ( Groans ) ( Blast, blow lands ) Aah! ( Ping! ) ( Coughs ) It s funny. I always wondered who would win if we ever fought. Then you were always a bad friend. ( Powering up, blasting ) Aah! ( Cocks weapon ) Morty, we had one grenade. He had a gun. Whatever. Come on. Did you hear something? Doesn t matter. If anyone s around, they re here to stop the laser, and they can t do it without us seeing them. \""Working together is our belt\""? You gave it away! You said we didn t need it. I wish you were never born. You were an accident. ( People screaming ) How come some of the pants are... The NX-5 can t destroy Wrangler jeans. Like, it literally can t destroy them or it s programmed not to? Gee, what do you think? ( Whooshing ) ( Grunting, firing, blows landing )  266a  266a  266a  266a You kill a good bug, for a horse doctor. Thanks, me. Maybe we could do, like, a \""Parent Trap\"" thing together sometime. As long as you mean the Lindsay Lohan version. (British accent) Naturally. What do you think they do with all those jeans? Make them into jackets? It s not about conserving denim. It s marketing. Like, uh, \""The NX-5 destroys the whole planet except for the Wrangler jeans.\"" Because they re so tough. Tougher than the laser? Stupid. You re talking about it. Mm, you re right. They... they got me. Hey, over here. Look at me. Did you just see a pantsless little boy run by? I m not falling for that again. I used to be invisible, but now I m the opposite. Get him. But not in a weird way. You made it weird.  266a  266a NX-5 corporate sponsor detected. Cannot penetrate Wranglers. Built too tough. Built... too... tough. I killed them! I-I did... I did it offscreen. God damn it. Morty, fix your underwear. I saw your balls for a second. That s on you. Why can t I meet your parents? Are you embarrassed of me? No, of them. Aww. ( Explosion, splatting )  266a  266a ( Groaning, banging ) ( Electricity crackling ) Unh... ahh! ( Blasting ) ( Groans, entrails splat ) Never thought this was how I d die. ( Slurps ) We re nowhere near Venice, and you re not a dwarf in a raincoat. ( Powering up ) Step back. You re not killing him till we kick his ass, Bird Person. My name is Phoenix Person. No one s calling you that. Dumb. It fascinates me that an entire family can be this critical and suck this much. ( Blasting )  266a  266a Aah!  266a  266a Aah! Bird Person, stop. It s me, that Tammy girl. Tammy, this is unexpected. I was told you were dead. That is ab-so-lute-ly not true. I m more alive than I ve ever been. You are behaving rather strangely. Me? Strange? Oh, my. Well, who s normal, really? Now, come here, you big hollow-boned featherhead. Let me give you some of this sweet ass. ( Jerry yelps ) ( Roaring ) ( Powers down ) Saved the day with puppeting. Only one with a decent arc. He does have his moments. Mom, Dad! Mom. Uh, we did it! Morty became super visible! Summer put my jeans in a laser! Morty, look at your little balls! I know! Bring it in here, guys. Damn, this thing has twin turbines? I ll forgive you for abandoning us if you let me drive it. That works for me... I was just gonna give you space cigarettes. I love having two moms. And I love having two wives. Never gonna happen, Jerry. You jerk-offs ready to get the answers to your burning questions? What s this, Dad? The memory of which Beth is real and which Beth is a clone, obviously. You mind-blew yourself? You... You literally don t even know which of your daughters is real. Of course you don t. Why am I surprised? I m sure you d love for us to need that from you, but I don t care what s in that vial. Yeah, me neither. You re a piece of shit either way. So what? After all this, you don t want to know the truth? The truth is we have more important shit to do like raise our kids and stamp out the Federation, neither of which seem like they want anything to do with you. ( Both laughing ) Morty? Sum-Sum?

However, their ship and its controls are damaged beyond repair, and Rick passes out from his wounds before he can fix it. Realizing they're about to die either through re-entry or by the impact, Morty decides to call Jessica and confess his feelings for her, blaming the timing for not doing it sooner. However, Jessica reveals that she was interested in Morty for some time now, and asks to visit his house to watch a movie. Revitalized by this revelation, Morty tries to regain control of the ship, which he does at the last second, but he hits a palm tree that catapults him back into the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the nature of his wounds, Rick wakes up and sees where they landed, and in a panic, tries to flee with Morty, but is too late as his old arch-nemesis, Mr. Nimbus, appears and cries foul at Rick for violating an ancient treaty.  Back at the Smith Residence, Rick is frustratingly preparing the table for dinner between himself and Mr. Nimbus. Despite Morty's attempts to get out of it, Rick assigns him to be \""booze guy\"" for the dinner as he leaves a few crates of wine in a \""[[Narnia Dimension|Narnia-like Dimension]]\"" as Mr. Nimbus prefers his wine aged to a few centuries. Mr. Nimbus arrives and controls the police to do random things after Jerry tries to call them to get him out of the house. Jessica arrives shortly after and is hurriedly rushed to the living room by Morty and gets her to choose anything she wants from the TV while he deals with Mr. Nimbus' demands for wine. Back at the Narnia Dimension, he encounters a couple who kept the wine safe for a few decades and give him love advice for his date with Jessica. However, once he returns, Mr. Nimbus consumes them both in a split second and orders Morty to get more, to his dismay. He goes back, only to find the deranged son of the couple he met just a few minutes earlier trying to kill him for the murder of his parents. Morty briefly leaves to regain his composure before returning, and kills the couple's now elderly son in front of his children. Realizing he told them the truth, they apologize to him shortly before dying of his wounds, and made a blood oath to kill Morty should he return.  As time goes by, the farm evolves into a fortress and then the fortress into a castle, with all of its inhabitants bent on killing Morty. They believe they accomplish this when he returns for more wine and they open fire on him forcing him to retreat. Fed up with all these setbacks, Morty equips himself with every weapon and armor he can get and massacres the entire castle of its inhabitants in a fit of rage. He finds the remainder of the wine and heads back, unaware that he left his levitation glove behind for a group of survivors to pick up.  Finally done with all that, Morty gives all the wine to Mr. Nimbus, save for one bottle, which he smuggles to the living room for himself and Jessica to share. He tries to apologize for making her wait, but she ignores all that and kisses him. Before this can progress any further, they decide to drink up the wine and find a bottle opener, but Rick tries to drag him away to be a witness to the \""contract\"" that he and Nimbus are making. At the same time a dog-horse specimen named Adam (who is the son of the woman who found Morty's levitation glove in the ruins of the castle following its destruction at Morty's hands) dons a power suit, opens a portal and arrives in the kitchen with the intent to kill Morty. Despite his best efforts (and after being distracted by Mr. Nimbus), he is defeated by Jessica, who after finding the bottle opener, uses it to stab the tube connected to his suit. This causes his suit to implode (following a brief vision where Adam encounters a giant owl-like creature) and in turn, causes the tube to sever, flail and connect with the bottle opener which Jessica continued to hold in her left hand and consequently, sucks Jessica head first into the Narnia Dimension as it returns to it's point of origin.  Meanwhile, Rick and Mr. Nimbus fight over terms when Rick snaps and yells at Mr. Nimbus, claiming he doesn't need anyone or him to make him feel better, though Nimbus suggests that he's turned into a hollow shell of himself because of Diane, causing Rick to strangle him. Meanwhile, Morty is tricked by robots into capture and sees Jessica, seemingly unconscious, encased in a crystal above him. While the scientist robot monologues as to why the society before them picked him for petty vengeance, Morty is able to break free of his restraints and free Jessica in the process. On the way back, they're surrounded by robots. Rick sees Morty and Jessica struggling to break free from a robotic tentacle and attempts to rescue them just to get rid of Mr. Nimbus, but he is dragged into the dimension as well and his weapons are stripped from him, forcing him to run into an enclosure with Morty and Jessica. Just as it all seemed lost, a huge wave of water along with an army of sea creatures rushes in and engulfs the entire dimension. It's revealed that Mr. Nimbus had secretly followed Rick and rescued him from the robots, causing Rick to reconcile with him.  Back at the residence, Rick and Mr. Nimbus have started to get along well when Summer returns with a conch shell she acquired from fighting deep-sea creatures in the Mariana Trench, completely ruining their relationship once again, and Mr. Nimbus beats up Rick before controlling the police to arrest him. At the same time, Jessica, who unfortunately, is revealed to have actually been fully conscious for the centuries of time she spent in the crystal, has opened up to time and begins to philosophically rant to herself before calling off the date with Morty, saying they should just be friends. As she walks into the night, she flips off a nearby driver and declares herself to be a time god.  Afterwards, Beth and Jerry head to Mr. Nimbus' place to take up an offer to a threesome with him after seeing his approval of them as a \""progressive couple\"" earlier. They start to have some doubts on pulling through with it until Mr. Nimbus opens the door, and the couple sheepishly dive into his arms.","[Open on Morty carrying a bloody Rick in his hands on the surface of an unknown planet.

Jessica’s coming over j-just to, like, watch a movie or something, but y’know, t-t-that’s a good step. That’s a solid step to something, y’know? Truly nobody cares about your [bleep] Morty. The sooner you learn that, the better. I think you just don’t want me happy ’cause then I’ll stop doing your crazy chores. Trust me, after that ocean [bleep]up, you don’t get to do anything crazy. While I bull[bleep] my way through this peace summit treaty with Nimbus, Summer is gonna dive into the Marianas Trench to recover the forbidden shell that gives him his power because Summer can be trusted. Let’s lick [bleep] Okay, what? I don’t love that. Of course you don’t, ’cause you guys aren’t getting any. [Scoffs] Actually, your father and I have been very sex-positive lately. Eww. Dr. Wong suggested we experiment. We’ve been watching pornography. Together. Gross! I might never come back from the ocean. Oh, you’ll have to tone it down, babe. The squares can’t handle it. [Purrs] There are su1c1de capsules in all of your teeth. Do what you want with that. C’mon, Morty. You’re on booze duty. Okay, Nimbus only drinks the good [bleep] So just toss this whale-ass ocean-wine in here and age it up a few centuries. So time moves faster in there? I-I-Is it like a Narnia thing? I’m not a beaver who believes in Jesus Christ, Morty. But yeah, it’s pretty much a Narnia thing. Okay, but Jessica — All you have to do is bring wine, Morty. When do I ask you for anything? When do you — I haven’t been to a full week of school in years! I don’t know shit! And for what? How many enemies do you have to have? Why is everything a fight with you? You might want to learn this early, Morty. Life is a fight. With Mr. Nimbus? Are you makin’ fun of me? Mr. Nimbus is an ice-cold dick k*ll, Morty. [Horn blows] Okay, let’s go. That’s his magic ocean horn. Is that Mr. Nimbus? Nimbus. Richard. You look like ass. Let’s get this over with. I’m sorry. This is the guy? Jerry. Hold on. No. I’ve seen you [bleep] a planet, and this is the guy you’re afraid of? I like this one, Rick. He is unbroken. Untamed. Perhaps he could use a firmer grip upon his leash. Okay, that’s enough. I’m calling the police. Go ahead. Jerry. I will! Good. I control them. Excuse me? He controls police, Jerry. Right, that tracks. In Dumb World. Police? A strange horny ocean man is on my lawn.

I take it you’re a sex-positive couple? Oh, yeah. Very much so. We watch p*rn together. Great! I’ll mark you down as eligible for a threeway. Here’s all the information you’ll need. The king of the ocean wants to have a threesome with us? Totally optional. But a remarkable option to have, I assure you. Very jealous. There’s a form on the last page so we know where to send the gift basket. So that just happened. You don’t sound upset about it. Neither do you. Oh, my God. Is this happening? To us?

Beth tells everyone Jerry is getting a job. Rick points this out as something wrong, then squid like creatures break into the house and shoot everyone one by one. Somewhere else, Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted is asking to be hunted, and the family tries to grab him until Rick's watch activates an alarm, showing that someone just killed a decoy family.    ''<nowiki/>''  In the car, Rick explains that squid people are trying to hunt him down, and since the Space Beth incident, he has created various decoy families in various places around the country to protect themselves from any possible killers attempting to murder the family. However, the Smiths begin to argue, and as they do, the squids attack them from above and proceed to shoot their car to bits. However, they are quickly revealed as a decoy family. Another family is in Italy on vacation, and are ambushed and killed. In yet another house, a Rick and Morty notice that their decoy family has been destroyed and lock the house shut and proceed to watch a show about a time-travelling werewolf called ''<nowiki/>'When Wolf''' on interdimensonal cable. However, their commentary on the show is interrupted when more squid people attack them, bombarding their house regardless of the security.    ''<nowiki/>''  ''<nowiki/>''  In yet another version of the Smith Residence, another Smith family takes notice. The five of them talk about it, and Summer asks if they are decoys themselves. This scares Rick as he tells Morty to check for a number on his butt. Morty looks and Rick farts. Jerry comes out with gluten-free, sugar-free, and lemon-free lemon squares, and Rick flies them in his Space Cruiser to one of the decoy houses. He enters and says the password, freezing them in place. Morty finds that the decoys are making decoys. Rick goes to his decoy and re-activates his head to ask questions before de-activating the being entirely. They drive around the countryside, and spot another Smith Residence created by another Rick, except Rick does not remember building them. They go to investigate, and another Rick says his password, freezing the other decoys. Seeing this, the first family hides as a second family comes into the scene. The second family unfreezes their decoy to ask questions, but realize that others are among them. Both sides accuse the other of being a decoy family, and they proceed to brawl, only to be destroyed by a fourth Rick and his family.    After Rick briefly explains what is happening, they disguise themselves as their mysterious squid opponents and shoot one of the ships down. They proceed to loot their ship, only to realize that the squids were actually a decoy family in disguise. A decoy Jerry throws a bomb, incinerating them. The commotion caused by the various decoy families has made various versions of themselves worried if they are decoys or real, leading to various deaths and families checking to see if they are real or not. One family is in the woods, fleeing the commotion when they are tranquilized by another decoy who takes them to his version of the Smith Residence. The decoy reveals himself to be a scarecrow-like version that was so poorly-made that he knew he was fake from the moment he was created; he harvests the skin of decoys to look more like them, and provides skin for his own version of the Smith family.    However, before he can skin them alive, a Glockenspiel version of the Smith family intervenes, saving the other Smith family from the scarecrow versions. They do not care for killing other decoys, instead saving as many as they can. They take their counterparts into a canyon, where a community of various decoys hides underground. The squids attack them, causing Glockenspiel Jerry to lock himself in the escape route with a can of varnish, effectively leaving the decoys to die. As another family kills a few decoys, their Rick ultimately decides to end the cycle by creating an Andross-styled beacon to attract the various decoys towards his version of the Smith Residence, all of which proceed to engage in an all-out battle royale, killing each other one by one until only one remains standing.    Yet another version of the Smith family, disguised as lazily made decoys, take off their disguises and go into their Space Cruiser to investigate. However, one of the remaining versions shoots them from above, forcing them to fight. Ultimately, the ones that crashed win, but they are all killed by Mister Always Wants To Be Hunted, who was angered by the fact that he wasn't being hunted.    Up in space, what is presumably the real Smith family is wrapping up on an adventure with Space Beth when Rick's watch goes off, revealing the decoys were killed off once more, raising questions from his family.     Meanwhile, Glockenspiel Jerry escapes into the wilderness, takes off his clothes, puts the whole can of varnish onto himself and goes down the river. However, he is soon spotted by a group of beavers who use him as a crib for baby beavers. The water floods, putting him to sleep and he wakes to see he is stranded in a wasteland. The descendants of a dolphin and a woodpecker, who speak of him as a relic from a kinder past, take him to their place. Then, he wakes up as part of the ornament of a saloon mirror and sees green, reptilian cowboys who are surprised at him and burn him alive. Finally, he awakens a third time to see yellow humanoids living in their version of the Roman Empire and reenacting the origin of Christianity.  Glockenspiel Jerry awakens embedded on the cross of the yellow humanoid Jesus, laments his inability to die and says that this the worst thing that ever happened to anyone.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Beth sets down a plate of eggs in the center of the table.]     Beth   : You two are hungry.     Rick   : Big day.     Morty   : We re gonna kill God.     Jerry   : Come again?     Rick   : Christian God is real, he s been asleep for thousands of years. We re gonna sneak up there and kill him.     Morty   : Mob style.     Rick   : Whack his ass.     Summer   : Can I kill God?     Rick   : [at the same time as Morty] Fuck off, Summer.     Morty   : [at the same time as Rick] Pfft, as if!     Jerry   : Beth, do you hear this?     Beth   : Sweetie, don t get all worked up before your job interview.     Rick   : Job interview?     Jerry   : Yes, is that so hard to believe?     Rick   : Actually, yeah. Something s off.  [The Smith s window explodes and a squid alien drops through the ceiling, holding a gun and shooting Rick in the head, killing him.]     Beth   : No!  [The squid turns around and shoots her. Summer screams and tries to run, and the squid shoots her as well.]     Morty   : Shit!  [He and Jerry are shot from behind by two more squids. The three shooters stand over the dead Smiths, before the scene cuts to a small yellow man in a striped onesie with a bullseye on the front running around the house while the Smiths chase him and Summer shoots at him.]     Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted   : Hunt me, hunt me, somebody hunt me!     Rick   : Don t hunt him to completion!     Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted   : Hunt me!

Jerry   : Rick?     Beth   : Dad? What s wrong?     Rick   : Someone just killed a decoy family.     Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted   : I m Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted!     Rick   : Yes, and how interesting did you think that would stay?  [TITLE SEQUENCE]  [The Smiths are driving down the street.]     Morty   : You made clones of us?     Rick   : Decoys, Morty. Very different. [To Beth] Very different, sweetie.     Morty   : Different h-ow! [Rick pinches him.]     Beth   : Yeah, dad. Different h-ow?     Rick   : Lotta people out there want a piece of this, sweetie. I m cool, and it makes them feel bad. So, y know, after that trouble with Space Beth, I made passable copies of the family and placed them around the country as a buffer zone to protect 2013     Jerry   : But why does he always want to be hunted?     Beth   : Jerry 2013     Morty   : It s not important right now, dad!     Jerry   : Sure, guys. Rick can make secret decoys of the family and place them all around the country, but fuck me if I have questions about the starfish man in a target suit.     Summer   : So thankful this is my Saturday.     Jerry   : Why was he in that cryopod?     Rick   : The cryopod is what confuses you? Jerry, can t you see we ve moved on to higher stakes?     Jerry   : Well, I don t see any stakes at all.  [A spaceship drops down and melts the car with a laser beam. Two squid aliens descend from it and shoot the remains of the car. The scene cuts to the family by an Italian villa by a pool. Rick s watch beeps.]     Rick   : Ah, shit!  [The Smiths are all packing in their room.]     Jerry   : Guess we ll just be saying \""  ciao bella  \"" to our deposit, then!     Rick   : Shut up and pack, Jerry. Squids just killed a decoy family.     Beth   : Decoy family?     Morty   : Is this why you wanted to get out of town?     Rick   : You think I d lie to you about why we re on vacation, Morty? I wouldn t lie to you. [Morty glares at him.] Well, that s a lie. Huh.     Summer   : So someone out there is trying to kill us?     Rick   : Someone s always trying to kill us. That s what the decoys are for. They go on fun, self-contained terrestrial adventures, and 2013[a bomb smashes through the window] take bullets meant for us. Shit.  [The bomb explodes, vaporizing everyone except Jerry, who loses his bottom half and right arm.]     Jerry   : Ahhh! No!  [A squid bursts through the window and shoots him in the head. Rick and Morty are on the couch when his watch beeps.]     Rick   : Ah, shit. Decoy family.  [He takes out a remote and presses the button, activating the house s blast shields.]     Morty   : I think dad was still outside. What s a decoy family?     Rick   : Hard concept, Morty. Hard concept. I ve never really cracked it, if I m being honest. Decided it was maybe better as a kind of kinetic mislead for another special episode!  [He grabs the TV remote.]     Morty   : Oh, cool!     TV   : We now return to   When Wolf  .  [On the TV, a werewolf appears in front an ancient cave.]     Rick   : Woah, a time traveling wolf? Count me in.     Morty   : Yeah, I never thought of the \""were\"" in \""werewolf\"" like \""who, what, when and where!\"" Clever wordplay!  [Dracula, in caveman attire, emerges from the cave.]     Dracula   : When Wolf!     When Wolf   : Dracula! You know why I m here.     Dracula   : I m safe here, Ian! Christianity hasn t been invented yet, crosses are just baby t s to me now! I got out. Please, don t invite me back in.     Morty   : Huh, kinda mucked it up with this Dracula stuff.     Rick   : You re right. It shows a lack of faith in their core concept. I d much rather watch When Wolf go to the 20 s and invest in the stock market, but then eat people.     Morty   : Yeah.  [The two are suddenly shot through the head by a laser beam. A squid ship flies above the house and drops a couple bombs, blowing it up. Suddenly, the Smiths, minus Jerry, are sitting around the table.]     Rick   : Look, if you really want to know what happened to Beth s mom, it 2013[his watch beeps] whoop. Squid aliens just killed a decoy family.     Beth   : Decoy family? You made more clones?     Rick   : Clones are, like, thirty-two percent of all sci-fi, sweetie. You don t get to own clones. Yes, I made some decoys. They re exactly like us, with a few tweaks and a backdoor shutdown.     Beth   : Do you just get hard creating sentient life?     Rick   : Actually, I get hard protecting my family!     Summer   : Ew.     Morty   : Ugh, gross!     Beth   : Yeah, now everyone gets killer doppelg 00e4ngers. Cool deal.     Rick   : The decoys are harmless, Beth.     Summer   : Grandpa Rick, do the decoys know they re decoys?     Rick   : They wouldn t be very good decoys if they did, Sum-sum.     Summer   : So they think they re us?     Rick   : That s the deal.     Summer   : How do you know   we re   not decoys? [Rick stops eating and drops his fork.] Oh my god, we re decoys.     Rick   : Oh, god! We might not be real! We might be decoys! Morty, quick!     Morty   : What do I do?     Rick   : My failsafe, Morty. My final, secret failsafe. It proves I m real, you have to help me, I d never joke about this. [He pulls his pants down and sticks his ass in Morty s face.] There s a barcode, Morty. A barcode on the interior of my left ass cheek.     Morty   : What?     Rick   : Morty, please, I m begging you!     Morty   : I m not looking at your ass!     Rick   : Please, Morty, is it there? God damn it! [He tears up.] Just tell me if I m real!     Summer   : Morty, do it!  [Morty leans in. Rick farts in face and laughs.]     Morty   : Gross!     Beth   : Dad!     Rick   : Summer, you fucking idiot. We re not decoys.     Morty   : Why did I get punished?     Rick   : A, decoys don t build decoys, and B, you think the mere suggestion I m fake would break me? Christ, I m not your mom.     Beth   : Fuck off.  [Rick s watch beeps again.]     Rick   : Jeez, these guys really wanna kill me bad. Alright, here s the plan. We re gonna hide out with a decoy family, and when these squids show up, we jump their asses. Jerry! Come on! Family emergency!  [Jerry emerges from the kitchen, holding a tray of lemon squares and wearing oven mitts.]     Jerry   : A bigger emergency than my lemon squares not setting? They re gluten free, sugar free, and lemon free!  [The entire family looks unimpressed. Rick s car lands outside another Smith house. Rick walks into the dining room, where another family is eating breakfast. The decoy Rick stands and pulls a gun.]     Decoy Rick   : Think you got the wrong house, bro.     Rick   : Analysis mode, password 8-0-0-8-5.  [The decoy family flickers blue and freezes in place. The real Smith family walks in.]     Beth   : Kind of expected a funnier password.     Rick   : I didn t plan on showing them off.     Morty   : [examining his decoy] Damn, like   Westworld  !     Rick   : Yes, Morty, like   Westworld  . But don t fuck them. [Summer starts going up the stairs.] Summer!     Summer   : Whatever, creep. I m gonna see how accurate you got my room.     Morty   : Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house, did you mean like, you know, an   exact   replica?     Rick   : I know about the Yosemite t-shirt, Morty.     Morty   : Shit.     Rick   : You know you can use tissues, right?     Morty   : I can t finish without it.  [Beth takes a photo of the Smiths off the wall.]     Beth   : So you   do   know what a happy family looks like.     Rick   : I know what a fake one looks like.  [Morty calls Rick, in his lab under the garage.]     Morty   : Uh, Rick?     Rick   : [pokes his head into the lab] What?     Morty   : Did you use this house to make decoys, too?     Rick   : [descending the ladder] What? Morty, why the fuck would I do that? You think I d go somewhere else to 2013 [he sees what Morty is looking at 2014decoy making equipment, exoskeletons, and blueprints] okay, well, I am now less worried about the squids. [Rick runs up to the frozen decoy Rick.] Isolate head at normal processing. [The decoy s head unfreezes and Rick slaps him in the face.] What the fuck do you think you re doing down there? You re making decoys?     Decoy Rick   : Wait, how do you 2014oh god, Summer was right.  [Rick presses a button on his watch, and the decoy overheats and shuts down.]     Rick   : Everyone in the car.  [The family is flying in the car.]     Beth   : You said decoys didn t make decoys.     Rick   : And usually, they don t, but again, it s nothing to worry about, because decoys are harmless. [He pulls up a map of where the decoys are located.] Just have to, y know, visit the rest and terminate the program.     Beth   : Terminate? They re alive, dad!     Rick   : And at some point, they won t be. That s how existing works. What, are you going to save every stray cat?     Beth   : No, but I can resist making more of them in a lab.     Rick   : Ugh. Look, save the empathy. It s more termite infestation than   Blade Runner  .     Summer   : I still think we re decoys.     Morty   : You just want an excuse to stop trying.     Summer   : Yeah, and?     Jerry   : [pointing] Oooh, there s a handsome fellow!     Rick   : Uh-oh.  [A decoy Jerry is outside, mowing the lawn. Rick lands next to him and takes out a gun.]     Beth   : I thought you made them harmless.     Rick   : I don t remember making this one. [He gets out of the car.]     Decoy Jerry   : Oh, hi, Rick! Family...me...? Hey, when did you all leave?     Rick   : Analysis mode, 8-0-0-8-5.     Decoy Jerry   : Hmm?     Rick   : Nothing, buddy. You gotta stop with all that coffee, it s making you loopy! Happy analysis mode! [The family heads inside.]     Decoy Jerry   : Happy analysis mode to you, too!  [A Rick is inside, watching   Mrs. Pancakes  . He stands up.]     Decoy Rick   : Think you got the wrong house, bro.     Rick   : Analysis mode, password 8-0-0 2013     Decoy Rick   : Shit, you think I m a decoy?     Rick   : How do you know about the decoys?     Decoy Rick   : They were my idea!     Decoy Jerry   : [from outside] Well, now I know you re pranking me.     Second Rick   : Analysis mode, password 8 equals sign equals sign capital \""d\"".  [The decoy family freezes.]     Rick   : Hide.     Morty   : What?     Rick   : Hide!  [He shoves Morty into the closet under the stairs, grabs Beth, and shuts them all in. Summer crawls under the couch, and Jerry unsuccessfully tries to hide in the full refrigerator before hiding under the dining room table as the second Smith family enters the house.]     Second Morty   : Wow, like   Ex Machina  !     Second Rick   : Yes, Morty, like   Ex Machina  . But don t fuck them. Summer!     Second Summer   : Whatever, weirdo. I m gonna see how wrong you got my room.     Second Beth   : So you   do   know what a loving family looks like.     Second Rick   : A simulated one, yes.     Beth   : Why are we hiding?     Rick   : He thinks he s me, and   I   was about to start terminating decoys.     Beth   : But we re not decoys!     Rick   : Sure, tell   him   that.     Second Morty   : Rick, did you make decoys here, too?     Second Rick   : Morty, for what reason could I have for...what the 2013[he runs up to decoy Rick] isolate head at normal processing! [He punches decoy Rick in the face as his head unfreezes.] You dumb asshole, you made decoys?     Decoy Rick   : Again, they were my idea. Wait, what happened to the other guy?     Second Rick   : Other guy?  [Something rustles in another room, and the second Rick draws a gun.]     Decoy Rick   : Wait, that means   I m   a decoy. Fucking Summer.     Second Rick   : Check the closets.  [He opens the closet to find Rick, Morty and Beth. Both Ricks draw their guns and fire at each other, missing.]     Second Rick   : They ve gone rogue!     Rick   : Killer decoys!     Second Rick   : Take out the decoys!  [The \""original\"" Smiths run to the kitchen, while the second Smiths take shelter in the living room. The Ricks fire at each other.]     Decoy Rick   : Shit! Someone put a gun in my teeth!  [Second Rick pushes a button on his watch and the decoy Rick deactivates.]     Second Beth   : Stop shooting, dad! They re us, we don t have to fight them!     Second Rick   : Classic prisoner s dilemma, Beth. I m a cool guy, I, you know, I can talk it out. But that asshole 2013     Rick   : Me? You decoy piece of shit. You re the one that shot first!     Beth   : We can work this out, just stop trying to kill each other!     Second Rick   : Sorry, decoy Beth, but this only ends one way, with one of us accepting we re a decoy.     Rick   : And once he knows he s a decoy, he know he won t be safe until he s killed the real Rick, along with anyone who think he s him.     Second Rick   : Pretty perceptive, for a decoy.     Rick   : This is getting nowhere. Let s charge their asses on three.     Morty   : Do we have to do this?     Rick   : Morty, this is gonna sound bad, but...would you trust me not to kill you?     Summer   : Oof.     Morty   : I mean, good point, but Jesus Christ.     Second Rick   : We rush them on three. Ready?     Second Morty   : I don t want to kill us, Rick!     Second Rick   : It s them or us, Morty. I don t trust me. Do you trust you?     Second Morty   : Yes?     Second Rick   : Freak.  [The two Smith families, both minus Jerry, yell and charge at each other. Just as they start to fight, a massive burst of flame burns through the walls and incinerates both families, revealing a Rick holding a flamethrower and a Smith family standing outside.]     Rick   : Before you say anything, they were already killing each other.     Beth   : Well, you could ve done something.     Rick   : Not sure, actually. I ve heard stories about this. We re looking at a possible Asimov Cascade.     Jerry   : Sorry, what s happening?     Summer   : I need an explainer, too.     Morty   : Yeah, I m pretty much behind on this one.     Rick   : Car, can I get a whiteboard? [A large whiteboard emerges from the car and Rick starts to write on it.] When squids started killing decoys, decoys started checking their decoys and learning that they re making decoys. That s making them seek out and run into other decoys, making them realize they re decoys, making them start to kill other decoys.     Summer   : Say decoy again.     Rick   : Fuck you.     Beth   : Well, how do we stop it?     Rick   : Beth, the loop s already started. It s basically   Highlander   rules now. [The family looks at him silently.] Really? 1986? \""There can be only one?\"" Shit, we gotta rent it after this. Connery plays \""the spaniard\"" but does   nothing   about his accent.     Morty   : Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this, would killing them finish it?     Rick   : Might work. Alt pitch, we just terminate the rest of the decoys.     Beth   : Nobody s terminating anything. This is your mess, nobody else with our face and memories has to die.     Rick   : Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart, this thing feels pretty far gone. Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere, but also, we don t know how many decoys there are. You get far enough down the decoy line and shit starts to get weird. You ever make a copy of a copy?     Beth   : You re helping us fix this. We re taking out the squids.     Jerry   : I say we split up! Some of us take down squids, while the rest of us 2013     Rick   : Engage in B stories we ll have to track simultaneously? No thank you! We stick together till this is all wrapped up.     Summer   : I dunno, the squids seem pretty good at taking out Smith families.     Rick   : Well, this ll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that.  [Rick s car flies through the air, covered in a poorly made cloth squid. Inside the car, the family are all wearing identically poorly made squid costumes.]     Summer   : This costume smells like ass!     Rick   : God, there s no pleasing you!     Morty   : It s really bad, Rick.     Summer   : Did you let a gym coach break it in?     Jerry   : Why are we wearing these?     Rick   : Because we ll fit in and avoid detection as we take out all the squids. Might also help us anonymously take out excess decoys, if we have to.     Beth   : Which we won t.     Summer   : Unless we re decoys. He s starting to wonder! I knew it. I knew we didn t seem like Colorado people.     Beth   : [laughing] Oh my god! You are, aren t you? You re worried you might be fake!     Rick   : Sure, Beth. Try to love this more.     Beth   : Just glad you have to walk a mile in someone else s squid costumes.     Morty   : There s one. [He points to a nearby squid ship.] Hey, what re they mad at you for, anyway?     Rick   : Well, we re talking about me. It could be anything. Maybe jealous of my penis size, I had sex with their queen, my dick s too big, the list goes on and on.  [They fly up behind the squid ship and shoot it down, causing it to crash in a field. The car lands next to it and the family gets out.]     Rick   : Alright, hey, one down! Probably, what, forty more to go? Forty-five? Should be pretty easy, unless killing them brings in a bigger bad or some kind of horrible mothership. Okay, let s loot their ship, find their weaknesses, be done by sundown.  [Morty pulls the head off of a dead squid, revealing it to be a helmet with a dead Rick under it.]     Rick   : Huh.     Morty   : Wait, but if the squids are decoys and we dressed as squids...  [Summer unmasks a dead version of herself, and Beth unmasks a dead Morty.]     Summer   : Well, I found their weakness. They don t fucking listen to me!  [A wounded decoy Jerry crawls from the wreckage, collapses, dies, and drops the bomb he was holding, which rolls to the family s feet.]     Rick   : Honestly, probably for the best.  [The bomb explodes and the family vaporizes. Rick, in the garage, attaches jumper cables to a small alien creature and electrocutes it, causing it to poop out a piece of candy, which Rick eats.]     Rick   : [laughing] Man, I m good.  [Music starts to play. Rick s watch beeps, and he sighs just as a laser blows a hole in the roof and destroys the house. Inside, a squid charts a course for the next family. The family is in their dining room when Beth runs in.]     Beth   : Dad!  [The family is shot through their window by another family carrying rifles. Rick, the top of his head missing, digs around inside his open brain in front of his horrified family until he finds a chip that reads \""DECOY FIRMWARE V6 (YOU RE A DECOY) on it. He sighs, defeated. A Rick walks through the house, gun drawn, when another Rick leaps out of the closet and starts beating him with a pipe. A third Rick, painted to blend with the wall, watches. Summer cuts her arm and is relieved to see blood, but Rick pulls the skin off her arm, revealing a metallic skeleton. Two squid ships fly next to each other. One Rick takes off his helmet. When he sees the other squid is also a Rick, he sighs and shoots himself. The montage ends as the Smiths run through the woods. Rick s watch beeps.]     Rick   : Oh, shit. One of mine.     Morty   : Where are we going?     Rick   : Off grid, Morty. We re gonna live in the woods, like libertarians. We ll hunt rabbits and trade with, like, little pieces of gold bar that we cut off with a knife.     Summer   : That licks.     Rick   : We might be decoys, Summer. Everything about this licks.     Beth   : Oh, maybe now you ll empathize with the decoys you re killing!  [Rick stops running, and the family does too.]     Rick   : Wait, shhh. It s too quiet.     Summer   : You skipped quiet.     Rick   : I didn t skip shit. It s obviously quiet if it s too quiet.     Summer   : Yeah, but you re supposed to say 2013     Rick   : You know what, Summer, now it s not quiet enough!  [Rick is suddenly hit in the neck by a dart and collapses. Before the rest of the family can react, they are all hit as well. Rick regains consciousness as he is dragged across the ground, seeing a strange-looking Rick with worn out clothes being the one dragging him. Inside a rotting, overgrown version of the Smith home, the deformed Rick has strapped Morty, Summer, Beth and Jerry to tables as they all wake.]     Morty   : Where are we? Where s Rick?     Scarecrow Rick   : He s right here, Morty! [He appears in front of Morty, who yelps.] Oh, are we not happy to see grandpa? Does he look...different?  [Scarecrow Rick tugs on his head, revealing that he is wearing a crude Rick mask. Underneath is a Rick with brown, leathery skin.]     Jerry   : [at the same time as Morty] Oh, god!     Morty   : [at the same time as Jerry] Ugh, it stinks!     Scarecrow Rick   : Yes, recoil at the craftsmanship. I could tell I was a fake from the day I was born. Unlike you. Unlike them.  [He walks over to the opposite wall and flips a switch, lighting up the area and revealing multiple dead decoy Ricks strapped to tables, their skin gone. Their Rick is still alive, but his skin has been removed. Jerry screams.]     Scarecrow Rick   : You see, Ricks, they get lazy. There s always a shitty decoy towards the end. But those decoys made decoys too, and got lazy themselves. And far enough down the line...there be monsters.     Summer   : Ugh, we get it, you re ugly and mad about it.  [The alive Rick coughs.]     Jerry   : [at the same time as Summer] Rick!     Summer   : [at the same time as Jerry] Grandpa!     Rick   : Kill me...[looking at Scarecrow Rick] if I ever get this arch.  [Scarecrow Rick presses a button which electrocutes Rick.]     Scarecrow Rick   : Hush, little decoy. Can t kill you yet. The skin needs to be fresh.     Beth   : You know what? You re a monster.     Scarecrow Rick   : I m your father! At least, I can look more like him once I harvest all this yummy skin.     Rick   : This guy s really into skin.     Scarecrow Rick   : It s not all for me. A Rick provides for his family.  [He walks up to a cage, where equally deformed and leathery decoys of the rest of the family are being held.]     Scarecrow Beth   : Will I beautiful again, daddy?     Scarecrow Rick   : Soon, baby. Beautiful again soon.  [As a knife emerges from his wrist and he runs it over Beth s cheek, the ceiling explodes and wooden decoys of Rick, Summer and Morty drop through it.]     Scarecrow Rick   : What the 2013     Glockenspiel Rick   : Help the others!  [Scarecrow Rick draws his knife and runs at Glockenspiel Rick, who flips him over and shoots out a cuckoo clock bird from his hand, impaling Scarecrow Rick through the chest and killing him. Glockenspiel Summer douses his corpse and the cage in gasoline, burning him and the other Scarecrow Smiths. Glockenspiel Morty releases the skinned Rick, while Glockenspiel Rick cuts Beth free with a saw in his arm.]     Beth   : Why are you helping us?     Glockenspiel Rick   : Because we re all in this together. Come on! There s a place we can go!  [They fly off in  Glockenspiel Rick s car (which is made out of wood) and land in a canyon. Glockenspiel Rick presses his hand to a sensor in the canyon wall and a door opens. The group walks through, revealing a hall full of decoy families. Glockenspiel Jerry approaches his kids, holding a can of varnish.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Hey, who needs all this war stuff? I found a can of varnish. This is a ticket to the world beyond the river!     Glockenspiel Summer   : Who wants that? I crave glorious death in decoy battle!     Glockenspiel Morty   : Also, y know, depending on the varnish, might look like blackface.     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Excuse me for wanting to live.  [Glockenspiel Beth stand on a podium and addresses the crowd.]     Glockenspiel Beth   : Brothers and sisters, welcome to the cause. To   our   cause. We are no longer Ricks and Mortys, Beths and Jerrys, or also Summers.  [A group of Summers scoff.]     Decoy Summer   : Whatever.     Decoy Summer   : Asshole!     Glockenspiel Beth   : We are decoys. Brought into the world by an unloving god, and drive to destroy ourselves by the uncertainty he creates!  [A group of Ricks murmur disapprovingly.]     Decoy Rick   : I don t know if   that s   accurate.     Decoy Rick   : Sounds extreme.     Glockenspiel Beth   : But that violence ends today!  [The crowd cheers. A Jerry raises his hand.]     Decoy Jerry   : What about the squids?     Decoy Beth   : [at the same time as Decoy Summer] The squids are decoys!     Decoy Summer   : [at the same time as Decoy Beth] There were no squids!     Other Decoy Summer   : The squids are decoys who realized they re decoys and wanted to kill the other decoys.     Other Decoy Jerry   : Yeah, it is a lot.     Glockenspiel Beth   : We cannot let confusion divide us!  [An explosion sounds and a Morty runs into the room.]     Decoy Morty   : Squids! Squids, of course, being shorthand for killer decoys!  [The door explodes, killing the Morty. The crowd panics and runs around. Glockenspiel Rick approaches Glockenspiel Beth.]     Glockenspiel Rick   : Inner sanctum, the escape tunnel!  [The glockenspiels and a group of decoys run through a tunnel together. Glockenspiel Jerry makes it to the elevator first and closes it, all the glockenspiels shout angrily at him.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : I m sorry, I didn t ask for this! I just wanna live! But there s only so much varnish! I m sorry, I m sorry!  [The tunnel collapses, killing everyone outside the elevator. Inside a Smith house, Rick s watch can be heard beeping, only to be seen in the trash. The Smiths are standing together in the ocean, watching the sun set.]     Beth   : How long before the other decoys find us?     Rick   : Sooner or later. Can t really run from it. Any place we d think to hide is a place they d think to look. It s Rule 34 of an Asimov Cascade.     Beth   : I m just glad we re living to the fullest with the time we have left.     Summer   : [sighs happily] Well, peeing in the ocean was my bucket list item. Who s next?     Rick   : Jerry? Bucket list?     Jerry   : I d like to attend a game at every major league ballpark.     Rick   : Nope! Morty?     Morty   : I wanna ask a girl out at my weird New Mexico school.  [A squid ship appears above them.]     Rick   : Shit. Sorry, buddy. Sounds like it would ve been real heartwarming.  [The Smiths hold hands, close their eyes and smile as a laser beam obliterates them and the ship flies away.]     Morty   : They looked happy. Did we have to kill them?     Beth   : Well, maybe their Rick came to grips with his bullshit!     Rick   : You re so mean today! I m your dad, you like having me around!     Beth   : You keep putting us in danger!     Rick   : Whatever. This ll take forever, mind if I do something drastic?  [Summer, Morty and Beth stare at him and sigh as he pulls up multiple maps. The ship lands in front of the house and Rick and Morty head into the garage.]     Rick   : House, I need something quick. Can you whip up a   Star Fox   boss season four callback? Make it flashy?     House   : You got it, babe.  [The garage door shuts and Rick puts on a headset.]     Rick   : [to himself] Let s go, you little bitch. [He slaps himself.] It s showtime. [A projector descends from the ceiling and shines a blue light on his face.] Get centered.  [The house s blast doors lower and multiple turrets emerge from it, while a shield forms over it. Several orbs fly into the air, projecting a hologram of Rick s face and hands that mirror his movements and repeat his words loudly.]     Rick   : What up, you decoy motherfuckers? Come on down to Rick s house of squids, where I m serving your ass on a platter! [A squid near the house takes off its helmet, revealing a Rick made of stone who draws a gun..] I know what you re thinking: \""Fuck, a beacon! That s a great idea! He s got home turf, [a Smith family made of straw drawing a plan in the dirt turns to look at the hologram] a tacit psychological advantage, and absolutely pendulous balls!\"" [A squid in a ship removes its helmet, revealing it to be a robotic Rick, who pilots his ship towards the beacon.] And now you re thinking \""shit, that s totally what the rick-est Rick would do! I might actually be fake! [A LEGO Rick driving in a car notices the beacon, does a U-turn and removes the top of his head, pulling a gun out from it.] I pretended I didn t care if I was, but I totally did! Now the only way to prove I m real and not him is to ice his expository ass.\"" [Several squid ships and flying cars fly towards the beacon.] Yup. So let s do it. Come get some. What? No, Morty, I m gonna loop it. Why is it 2013  [The scene cuts to the exterior of, then the interior of the White House, where the president is sitting behind his desk while an advisor approaches him.]     Steve   : Sir, there seems to be a confluence of Rick Sanchezes killing each other over the American Southwest.     The President   : Sounds exhausting. How many of those states voted for me, anyway?     Steve   : Mr. President, I think the point of the electoral collage is 2013     The President   : To preserve slavery? That s right, Steve. I have the internet too. Now take your white ass to the kitchenette and bring me a Diet Coke.  [Rick finishes looping his beacon, removes the headset, and takes out a large rifle. He passes it to Beth, gives Summer an energy sword, Morty a laser whip, and Jerry a pistol.]     Rick   : Little out of character to say this right now, but you guys look really cool.     Morty   : We might be decoys, huh.     Rick   : One way to find out.  [He takes out his own gun and the Smiths charge outside, where decoys are killing each other en masse. Approaching ships and cars  lasers are blocked by the house s shield, while the turrets destroy multiple. A Rick kills another Rick with a device that rapidly ages him, only to be shot. A squid blows up a family and is immediately shot. The family inside the shield observes the carnage, and immediately start fighting as the shield drops. Summer cuts a squid in half while a ship shoots apart a family and bombs another. The scene cuts to a camp made on a hill. Rick s hologram is visible and its speech can still be heard. A puppet-like Rick and Beth watch the battle.]     Second Rick   : Looks like it s calming down. You wanna get in one more \""I told you so\"" about synthetic life or whatever this week s theme is?     Second Beth   : Oh, fuck you.     Second Rick   : [rolls eyes] Whoa.     Second Beth   : No, you don t get to be annoyed with this! You treat life and family as so burdensome, and yet you created an ocean of us because you re terrified of losing either!     Second Rick   : Shit.     Second Beth   : Yeah.     Second Rick   : Look, Beth, I might not be the real Rick. But even if I m not, he made me, or the me that made me. Which means somewhere inside of him is a version of Rick capable of hearing that. A version of Rick who s sorry. I m sorry about the clone thing, too. I love you.  [Beth hugs him.]     Second Beth   : Thanks, dad.I love you, too. You really think we re decoys?     Second Rick   : Eh. Who cares? We ll be the last ones left. Lucky that one did the beacon, this was gonna take weeks. [The beacon suddenly fizzles out.] Alright, let s mop up.  [He and Beth suddenly unzip their fronts, revealing them to be perfectly normal, wearing costumes.]     Second Beth   : Finally.     Second Rick   : Dressing as decoys too cute to murder. You know, I m not sure it helped, but I m glad we tried it.     Second Morty   : We re losing the costumes?  [The other Smiths remove their costumes.]     Second Summer   : Thank god, this decoy outfit smells like ass.     Second Rick   : Fuck you, Summer.  [They get into the car and fly off. Back at the house, Rick rips out a decoy Morty s robotic intestines. A decoy Jerry tries to crawl away, weeping, and Rick shoots him in the head. He sees the car flying overhead and bellows a war cry.]     Second Rick   : Shit, that guy s awesome. Okay, listen, he might actually be the real Rick. But whatever happens 2013  [Rick shoots a missile at the car, which detonates and propels Second Rick through the windshield and onto the lawn in front of him. As Rick approaches him, Second Rick draws energy swords from his hands. The Beths and Mortys fight, Summer runs off and Second Summer chases her, and the Jerrys weakly attempt to fight before dropping their weapons, hugging, and crying. Second Summer corners Summer in the backyard and Summer slices her across the cheek with a pen knife. Second Summer swings at her with her own knife.]     Summer   : Wait! We don t have to do this. We re both Summers. Shouldn t we at least try molly before we die?     Second Summer   : You know what, yeah. Fuck this noise.  [She offers her hand to Summer, who tries to stab her. Second Summer pins her against the shed and pushes her knife into her throat. She drops Summer and picks up a discarded squid gun, walking into the kitchen to find the Mortys wrestling, one pinning the other and trying to attack him with a spoon.]     Second Summer   : Wait, I don t know who to shoot.     Both Mortys   : Summer!     Second Summer   : I can t deal with this. I had to kill myself. You have too, to.     Both Mortys   : Summer!  [The Morty being pinned breaks the other Morty s hold and wrestles him to the ground. The Ricks are in the living room, shooting at each other.]     Rick   : Fuck you, I m real! I m the smartest man in the universe!     Second Rick   : Probably not even wrong. But that s just it. I m not a man. I m God!  [The Ricks leap at each other and Second Rick wrestles Rick into a headlock.]     Second Rick   : You re just made in my image.     Rick   : Fuck you.  [He chips one of his own teeth, which starts to glow red and beep. Second Rick chips his own tooth, creating a shield around him as Rick blows himself up. Second Rick spits out his own tooth as an exhausted Second Summer approaches him.]     Second Rick   : You the, uh, Summer I came with?     Second Summer   : Probably.     Second Rick   : Good enough. Morty?     Morty   : Yeah.     Beth   : I m here, too.  [Rick opens the closet to find a Jerry cowering in fear.]     Second Rick   : Holy shit, that was insane! I love you guys, I ve totally changed!  [Beth, Summer, Morty and Jerry are all shot and killed, while Rick is shot in the side.]     Second Rick   : Oh, fuck.  [As he collapses against the wall, Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted emerges from the kitchen, holding a gun.]     Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted   : You shoulda hunted me.     Second Rick   : What? Who 2014were you significant? Like, did we tee you up? You want to be hunted? God, I have so many questions. Why? What happens if 2013 [he dies.]     Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted   : Somebody hunt me!  [Rick s car flies through space, with the family and Space Beth inside.]     Rick   : Pretty cool adventure, huh? Big, long road trip adventure through space? Even ran into Space Beth. Maybe that ll happen more often!     Space Beth   : Let s not overdo it.  [The dashboard beeps.]     Rick   : Oh, shit. Looks like someone killed the decoy family.     Beth   : [at the same time as Space Beth] Decoy family?     Space Beth   : [at the same time as Beth] Decoy what now?  [CREDITS]  [Glockenspiel Jerry, his clothes removed, applies varnish to himself and gets in a river as Queen s \""Who Wants To Live Forever\"" plays. As he peacefully floats downstream, something swims under him.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Hello?  [He notices a group of beavers on the shore watching him.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Oh, oh my god! Oh my god!  [He frantically swims away as the beavers pursue him. He grabs onto a dead tree as the beavers catch up.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : No! No, no no, no no no no no!  [The beavers drag him under and the screen fades, before fading back in to Glockenspiel Jerry, who wakes up on top of a pile of sticks. He looks down and gasps, realizing he is on top of a damn and his body is limbless and being used as a nest for baby beavers.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Nooooo!  [He weeps. The beavers leave as the water starts to rise.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Oh god. Yes, yes, sweet death.  [The screen fades as the water washes over him. only to fade back in to his degraded body, covered in sand. Wind blows off the sand and he wakes up to desolate world.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Why am I still alive? Oh, god. Is there anything left? Hello?  [An anthropomorphic woodpecker and dolphin approach him.]     Woodpecker   : What is it?     Dolphin   : A relic...from a kinder past.  [The woodpecker hammers his beak against Glockenspiel Jerry s head before picking him up and carrying him off. He wakes up with only his head, attached to a mirror in a bar filled with frog-like cowboy aliens.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Wait, cowboys?  [The bar s patrons gasp and an alien takes the mirror and throws it into the street, causing the glass to crack. Glockenspiel Jerry screams as they burn the mirror. He wakes up, only to see a crowd of angry yellow aliens and alien soldiers in Roman-like garb. An alien nails a board to his head, which is being used as the top of a crucifix, holding a Christ-like alien.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Christianity again?   After   cowboys? You went all the way back around?!  [The aliens throw tomatoes at the three aliens being crucified. One hits Glockenspiel Jerry.]     Glockenspiel Jerry   : Oh god, why can t I die? This is the worst thing that s ever happened to anyone! [[Category:Transcripts]] [[Category:Season 5 transcripts]]""}]}}}"

He is attacked by a Captain Planet-esque superhero named [[Planetina]], who defeats him with her elemental powers, impressing Morty. When Rick tosses an aluminum can on the ground, Morty recycles it, attracting her attention. He awkwardly invites her on a date, to which she accepts, flying away with him and shocking Rick.  At breakfast sometime later, [[Beth Smith|Beth]] expresses concern at the idea of Morty dating a woman who looks much older than him, which he shrugs off. [[Summer Smith|Summer]] laments Morty's success with women while she has been recently broken up with, and Rick invites her on a bar crawl across three planets that are all about to end via natural disaster, to which she accepts, despite [[Jerry Smith|Jerry's]] objections. Morty receives news of a wildfire and ignores Beth's protest, going to it with the hope that he may see Planetina.  He arrives just as she stops the fire and the two express their mutual attraction to each other. She mentions having \""kids,\"" but is actually referring to the Tina-teers, four people who carry elemental rings and summon her using them. The Tina-teers arrive on the scene, and Morty realizes that they control, exploit, and profit off of Planetina. While Planetina is being interviewed by a news team, the interviewer notices Morty and asks if they are dating. Planetina hesitates, but Morty claims that they are, to her delight.  As they fly to the first planet, Rick and Summer make a \""no attachments\"" deal in regards to any sexual encounters they may have. They arrive at the first planet, Morglutz. While there, Rick finds himself attracted to an alien named [[Daphne]], and goes off to have sex with her. Summer shouts after him to have fun and reminds him to not get attached.  At night, Morty stays up flirting with Planetina over text. He thanks her for the flowers she sent him, which are a massive amount grown to look like his face. She appears outside his window and the two have sex. As Summer and Rick leave Morglutz and the planet is destroyed, she hears a noise coming from the trunk, which Rick brushes off.  At a convention called Eco-Con, the Tina-teers summon Planetina to host a panel, but Morty is taken with her during the summoning, the two still asleep together. The Tina-teers dispel her and security drags Morty away. The fire elemental, Eddie, assures the dirt elemental that he will deal with Morty. On the second planet, Slartivart, Summer realized Rick has taken Daphne with him, leaving her furious at the violation of the rules.  Morty, meanwhile, is tied up in a broom closet by security. Eddie reveals his plan to sell Planetina to a rich Arabic ambassador. He lights a mop on fire and attempts to burn Morty's face, but Morty knocks him down, frees himself, bites Eddie's finger off, and burns him and two guards alive with his own ring. He breaks into the conference room where Planetina is being sold, and kills the rest of the Tina-teers with their own rings, as well as two more guards and the ambassador.  After the destruction of Slartivart, Summer struggles to ignore Rick and Daphne having sex in the back of the car. During a break, Daphne talks to Summer, revealing why Rick is so attracted to her: she has a pair of breasts on each of her elbows. Summer remains confident that Rick will dump her upon reaching the third planet, but Daphne casually disagrees.  At home, Morty reveals that he has invited Planetina to live with the family now that she is free from the Tina-teers. Beth is still disheartened by the age gap of the two and demands Planetina leave. Morty, enraged, confesses his love for her, and the two leave together, going off to stop natural disasters and environmental destruction. Without anyone reigning her in, Planetina becomes more violent, slashing the tires on a highway full of cars, burning down a congressman's mansion, and killing a mine full of workers in a fit of rage, horrifying Morty.  On the last planet, Ferkus 9, the citizens are having a planet-wide orgy while Rick and Daphne dance together. Summer tries to dissuade him, telling him that Daphne is just using him, which he denies. She takes the ship and flies towards the asteroid about to crash into the planet, destroys it, and comes back down, asking Daphne if she will continue to stay with Rick now that they are no longer in danger. She casually leaves, shocking Rick. As they fly home, Summer apologizes, and Rick tells her that while he is angry at her, it was very like him of her to stop an apocalypse just to prove a point. When she apologizes again, he brushes it off and tells her he would do the same if she needed it.  Morty, alone in his room, is visited by Planetina. She begs him to try and make their relationship work, but he refuses, too disgusted by her actions at the mine. She insists that violence is the only way to save the Earth before bringing up how he killed her \""kids\"". Planetina then confesses her love for him but he sadly rejects her declaration. When he asks her to try and understand, she curses him out tearfully and flies away. Beth, hearing the argument, comforts a weeping Morty as the arrangement of flowers Planetina made of his face shows signs of decay. The song playing in the background is \u201cI Am the Antichrist to You\"" by Kishi Bashi.  In a post-credits scene, an alien from Ferkus 9 who had sex with his father, believing the world was going to end, arrives at work the next day. The two awkwardly converse before the son wishes him a happy birthday.  ==Characters== ===Major characters=== *[[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry Smith]] *[[Rick Sanchez]] * [[Morty Smith]] * [[Summer Smith]] * [[Beth Smith]] * [[Planetina]] * The [[Tina-Teers]] **[[Eddie]] ** [[Xing Ho]]",""":"""",""query"":{""normalized"":[{""from"":""A_Rickconvenient_Mort/Transcript"",""to"":""A Rickconvenient Mort/Transcript""}],""pages"":{""-1"":{""ns"":0,""title"":""A Rickconvenient Mort/Transcript"",""missing"":""""}}}

Jesus. My skin is on fire. W-Why is the rain doing that? [Laughing evilly] My acid rain will destroy all things green and natural or my name isn’t Diesel Weasel. [Laughs evilly] [People screaming] Huh. Well, that guy’s easy to please. Your acid rain is an acid pain… in the butt, Diesel Weasel! Yikes. Wow. Who’s the chick in need of a dialogue pass? First order of business is to clean up this acid rain with a little wind! Yoww! Ow! Ow, my leg! Wow. And now an elemental punch that’s too hot to handle! Wa-kah! Oh, wow. Curse you, Planetina! I’ll get you next slime! [Laughs evilly] There’s only one solution for Earth’s pollution — you! [Ting!] Wow. Morty, if you say “wow” one more time, I swear to f*cking God… Are you crazy, Rick? She’s right there! Yeah, get that aluminum, Morty. It’s 8% of the Earth. We’ll need every atom. Thanks! Every litter-bit helps! [Gasps] Your problem! Excuse me? S-Sorry. I-I-I wanted to say, “N-No problem, you’re welcome,” a-a-and it came out “your problem.” [Chuckles] I-I’m an idiot. Sorry. You’re not an idiot. You recycled. I-I’m Morty. Nice to meet you, Morty. I’m Planetina, and I hope you have a wonderful day. [Horn honks] Rick: Hey! The f*ck we doin’ here? Uhh, y-y-you like soft serve? There’s a shop around the bend. Oh, I don’t eat ice cream. Veal is a product of the dairy industry. Oh, that’s not good. No, it is not. [Horn honks] Oh, my God! Come on! Let’s go! I know a place that serves cruelty-free doughnuts. If you’d like, I could fly you and your friend there easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy. Okay, I-I-I’ll ask him. He — He said he can’t come. Let’s go! What the f*ck was that sh!t? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Electricity crackling] Planetina: The Earth is in danger! Pollution and waste are ruining our planet. Mother Nature has enlisted the help of four young adults from each major ethnicity — and when things look bad, and I mean really bad — they combine the powers of their elemental rings to create me! Planetina, conservationist super person! There’s only one solution… for Earth’s pollution — you! P-Pretty cool, huh? I-I can’t believe I actually hung out with Planetina. How old is this woman? She looks very mature. She’s a sentient amalgam of natural elements, so I don’t believe age applies to her. Great. Taylor Murphy dumps me the day before his hella-big pool party and my little brother’s dating a phase four super hero. Just sh**t me in the f*cking head until I die. Hey, hey, none of that, Summerfest. Look what you’re doing to your sister, you piece of sh*t. Is it weird that she hasn’t texted me yet? Yes. No. What if I told you that your Grandpa Rick’s got something up his sleeve that’s so Rick-diculous that it’s gonna make you forget all about that stupid assh*le that dumped you? [Plates clatter] Hey, my egg plate! Morglutz, Slartivart, and Ferkus 9 — three planets are all ending in a delayed succession of cataclysmic events. A jam like this comes around only once in a lifetime. Morglutz’s sun is going supernova, Slartivart is falling into a black hole, and Ferkus 9 is getting “Deep Impact”-ed by an asteroid. They’re all having a major, final blow out — and I’m gonna drug it up and suck it up before each one goes ka-blamo, and I’m taking my favorite grandkid along with me! Hells yeah. 10 seconds on Morglutz, and you’ll be up to your neck in I-could-give-two- sh*ts-about- what’s-his-ass. And also herpes. Um… Oh, my God, thank you, Grandpa Rick! I’m gonna go pack my rollie. Um, Summer? I-I-I haven’t given you my approval yet. [Door closes] Summer, approval is yet to be given here [Phone chimes] There’s a huge forest fire like 200 miles from here! This is amazing! Planetina’s bound to be there. Mom, I-I need the credit card to buy a train ticket. Absolutely not. Mom, this is the biggest wildfire of the year! You’re not going! You’re not going! Da f*ck I’m not. Last time I checked, this wasn’t Russia. It’s not Russia, Jerry. My heart is broken, and I deserve to let loose, and if you don’t like it, you can suck my bigger [bleep] Adios, C-words. Morty, I don’t want you getting hurt. Please, think this over. I don’t want to think! I want to see a girl I like. If you don’t want to help me, I’ll find my own g*dd*mn way to the wildfire. [Door slams] [Door slamming] I’ll get the wine. Thank you. The Governor has implemented a mandatory evacuation. Abandon all hope, people! Nothing will stop this fire. Nothing! [Air whooshing] Scratch that! Here’s Planetina, Savioress of Earth! Yeeouch! Talk about a hot foot. Better put this wildfire on ice! Morty: Come here, little buddy. Come on, come on, come on, I gotcha. Morty?! What are you doing here? Oh, hey! Y-You’re here, too? Yeah, I heard about the wildfire back home, and, you know, I stopped by to lend a hand. H-Here you go, fella. All safe now. [Chuckles] Ahh, rabbits — al-always hopping — Never stoppin’. [Chuckles nervously] Y-Yeah. S-So it was, uh, great hanging — hanging out the other day. I-I was getting kind of a — I mean I-I got kind of a p-positive vibe. Oh, good. I was putting one out. I-I really like you. Holy sh*t. I-I-I mean, uh, well, oh, all right. Next step, you w-want to go out again? I do! But, uh, Morty, I have kids. Oh, I-I-I’ll get along with them. I’m-I’m a kid. No, I mean the four kids that bring me into existence by combining the power of their elemental rings so I can save Earth from ecological disasters. Oh, them! No, I-I know about them. I-I like them. Oh, good. Well, here they are now. Hey, buddy, you want an autograph? That’s 20 bucks a pop. No, Eddie, he’s my friend. Morty, these are my kids, The Tina-Teers. Oh, hey. Tina, girl, have you gained weight? Uh, well, I had a plant-based doughnut yesterday. Just a half. Sugar is worst thing for figure, darling. You want to be ugly? Heh, I-I thought they’d be younger. They’ve been manifesting me since the mid-’90s. A lot has changed since then. This is freaking you out, huh? It is a lot to take in. I understand. Well, I guess I’d better go. See you around. Hi-de-ho, TV 58! Planetina, you single-handily saved a National Forest with ease. I do what I can, but I can’t do it alone! And who’s your friend over there? Oh! This is Morty Smith. He traveled 200 miles just to save a rabbit from the fire. He’s a very special guy. So, are you two dating? Oh, um, w– I-I-I — Yes, we are. [’80s pop music plays] F*ck love. F*ck love. All right, time to set the rules. Lay it on me. No whining. Done. No crying. As if. And absolutely, positively no getting attached. We’re here to smash max ass — quantity over quality. Deal? Deal!

Planetina’s got a lot of responsibilities. People depend on her. And you, my friend, are a distraction we can’t afford right now. She’s just a product to you, isn’t she? Something to make money off of. W-Well, Planetina’s more than that. She’s a brilliant, living thing, and I love her. Oh, you love her? Well, guess what. We own her. But not for long, of course.

Double sixes, baby! One, two, three… So, what’s next for Planetina? Well, now that I’m not distracted by book signings and publicity stunts, Morty and I can concentrate on more important things. Like school. Like moving in. Planetina doesn’t have a place to stay now, so I said she could live with us. Holy sh*t. Morty, no. I’m so full! What do you mean, no? Whoo! Don’t punch my lunch. [Laughs] I wouldn’t be a burden, Mrs. Smith. I only want to spend as much time as possible with your son. My son is 14, miss. I’m sorry, Morty. You’re way too young. But y-y-y-you were a teenager when Dad got you pregnant. I was 17! That’s at least 26 in boy years. I’m sure Planetina is very nice, but when you’re a teenager, love is fleeting, at best. You underestimate Morty. He is a very mature young man. See, Mom? I told you! This is not happening. End of discussion. Planetina, I think you should leave, please. Okay, Mrs. Smith. Oh, no! [Belches] Mom, I hate you! You suck! Hey, now, it’s only a game. Shut up! Shut up! Okay. My whole life, I’ve never fit in anywhere.

Curious, and to Beth's surprise, he quickly volunteers to work with her, with the purpose to use the mount to jerk him off. One week later, Morty relaxes at home, thinking back at his deed, before he notices a familiar barrel Rick brought back with him. To his shock, he learns that Rick borrowed a barrel of \""horse semen\"" from the hospital to create a bioweapon, to be used on an underground race of cannibalistic horse people called \""chuds\"" that he and Morty have been fighting. After Morty frantically convinces Rick not to test the semen to verify that it indeed belongs to a horse, Rick proceeds to work on his experiment. A power surge goes through it and the barrel explodes. When Morty comes to, he sees that the sperm have mutated into floating, toothy monsters that eat humans. Rick blames himself, believing he brought in a bad sample, much to Morty's guilt and relief.  The family is airlifted to the Pentagon's war room by [[the President]], where Morty agrees to lie for Rick and tells the President that they know nothing about the outbreak. The President brings in [[Professor Shabooboo]], the world's leading expert on sperm, who theorizes that the sperm will head to the Grand Canyon because of its vaginal shape. When he brings in a captured sperm monster and announces that he intends to analyze it, Morty shoots it to cover his tracks. At Morty's suggestion, the President sends Rick, Morty, the country's nukes, and a helicopter full of Marines to the Grand Canyon. The sperm, rapidly evolving, shoot down the plane with a trebuchet.  Rick, Morty, and two marines (one named Blazen that they believe to be incredibly cool) survive the crash, although the other marine is killed when the sperm attack. Morty saves a sperm with its tail stuck under a rock after it recognizes him as its creator, dubbing it [[Sticky|\""Sticky\""]]. In the war room, Summer comes up with an idea to create a giant egg for the sperm to flock to, but has her idea stolen by Shabooboo. Blazen leads them into the caves where the sperm are hiding, and ends up stabbing himself in the chest and accidentally revealing that he wears a thong, shattering Rick and Morty's image of him. He asks Morty to not tell Sports Illustrated model Kathy Ireland that he is wearing her thong. He then attempts to perform autofelletio on himself before the sperm devour him. They then freeze Rick in crystallized semen and the two are led to a talking sperm in a mechanical suit known as the [[Sperm Queen]], who reveals that Morty is the one responsible for their creation to a disgusted Rick.  Sticky breaks the two free and together they defeat the sperm. While Rick and Morty starting planting nukes along the canyon walls, they discover that the remaining sperm are all heading for Las Vegas. While expected due to the city's history, Rick wonders why now. It is revealed that Summer has volunteered an egg, and the soldiers have planted it on top of the Luxor, planning to shoot it into space after all the sperm enter the egg. Morty radios the President and finally tells him the truth, which horrifies him and the nearby Smith family; not only because of Morty's lack of self-control which led to the \""Space Sperm\"" but the realization that this will lead to the birth of an inbred biological child of Morty and Summer; in short, a \""Giant Incest Baby\"". The President orders Shabooboo to jettison the egg into space before any sperm can get to it, but learns that it will take thirty minutes with no way to bypass the timer. Shabooboo commits suicide to avoid any consequences after given credit for Summer's idea, while Rick, Morty, and Sticky are captured by chuds.  [[Chud King|The Chud King]] plans to kill and eat the trio to punish Rick for having sex with his daughter, [[Ponietta|Princess Ponietta]], but she intervenes after revealing she is pregnant with [[Rick's Foal|Rick's child]]. She convinces her father to send the chud armies to fight the sperm. In Las Vegas, the chuds and government fight the sperm to stop them from reaching the egg. The Sperm Queen almost crawls to the top of the Luxor, but is pushed to her death by Sticky. Unfortunately, to everyone's horror, he fertilizes the egg himself out of instinct. Summer attempts to destroy her egg, but the President intervenes, claiming that the baby now exists thanks to a heartbeat and it is election season. With no other option, they launch it into space.  Morty is met by Kathy Ireland, approaches Morty to ask if Blazen was wearing her thong when he died. Expecting that he was told to keep it a secret, she encourages him to be honest, even if it hurts people the truth pertains to. Morty tells her the truth and she leaves in disgust. Rick decides to commit to Ponietta as she gives birth to a human/chud hybrid that looks like Rick, but leaves with it without trouble, and Rick takes out a Staples \""Easy\"" button and presses it, causing it to say \""that was easy.\""  In a post-credits scene, an astronaut talks to mission control as he does maintenance on a satellite, discussing how his wife had a child to try and keep him on Earth, but he left her behind regardless. As he talks about how the guilt of this has affected him, the [[Naruto Smith|\""Giant Incest Baby\""]] rises up in front of him in a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey and begins shaking him. During it, the president and  mission control complain about him and his drama.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

We re gonna miss the movie! No, we re not. Okay, but we ve been here for hours. I-I don t want to hang out at the stupid horse hospital. This stupid horse hospital puts dinner on your table.

The nurses use it to collect... reproductive material. ( Click, whirring ) ( Squishing ) ( Click, whirring stops ) Okay, let s go see this latest piece of Marvel sh1t you kids are jizzing over. Yeah. A-About time. So, d-does your hospital ever need, like, after-school volunteers? Wow. Who are you and where did you put my son? Ha! No, no. Seriously. I-I m very interested in... in your work.

W-W-Whatcha doin ? Eh, nothing adventurous. You know that race of Underground Dwelling Cannibal Horse People that we re always fighting? Yeah, the CHUDs. W-W-What about  em? Well, don t tell anybody, but I m working on a bioweapon to use against them, so I got this barrel of horse semen from your mom s hospital and I m just gonna, you know, subject it to some otherworldly forces. Guess I should test it, make sure it s... Make sure it s what?! Horse semen, obviously. Okay, but it says it is right on the barrel! You re not being very scientific, Morty. Measure twice, cut once. Especially with semen. Did you even ask Mom if you could have this?! Morty, if I wanted to steal horse semen, I d... Yes, I asked her. What is at stake for you here? Why don t you trust labels?! All right! Fine! I won t test it! God damn. Your generation really picks random hills to die on. Don t get too close. I m running an inhuman amount of power through this semen. Should be safe, though, since the semen itself is, you know, also inhuman. Here we go. ( Crackling ) ( High-pitched whine ) ( Rumbling ) ( Creature growling ) ( Screaming ) ( Snarling ) ( Glass shattering ) W-What happened?! The sperm, Morty! They re super monster sperm now! I blame myself. Unless there was something about the sperm I didn t know. Are you... Are you saying that to mess with me? What? Mess with you how? Like, trying to get me to say something? Morty, I have no idea what you re talking about! For real? Yes! Okay. Good. Then... Then it s your fault!  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a  266a Beth: Dad, what the hell is going on?! Beth, sweetheart, can you give me a minute? I m trying to steer around the bodies of our neighbors. ( Thump ) Oh, that felt like Gene. That s on you, Beth. Dad, I swear... Mom, it s... it s not Rick s fault, it s... Space Sperm. What?! Yeah. Space Sperm. I-I ve seen  em before, but n-n-never like this. Space Sperm?! Sperm from Space? Very impressive verbal forensic work, Jerry. Holy sh1t. How big are space dicks? Don t answer that! Damn, they must be huge. ( Tires screeching ) Oh! ( Laser pistol zapping ) Oh, sh1t, oh, sh1t, sh1t. ( Roaring ) ( Snarling ) ( Pistol clicks ) Mr. Sanchez! The President is very eager to speak with you! Morty, look, you gotta do me a solid here. Y-you want me to keep the secret of where these things came from? Yes, technically, it s a lie, but I messed up, and I m embarrassed  cause it s, you know, science. No problem. I got your back, dawg. Really? Okay. Cool. And thanks, Morty. I thought that d be a harder sell. Y-You did a shameful thing. Dwelling on it isn t gonna help, you know, am I right? Sometimes you just gotta wipe it off, toss it in the trash, and head back to study hall. Uh, not getting the metaphor, but I ll take your hall pass. Sanchez! Get the hell in here! Space Sperm? Jesus, how big are space dicks? Same page club. Well, Mr. President, the theory of Cosmic DNA has been around for decades... Chupacabras, Yeti, Stonehenge, Ancient Rome. Are these all myths, monsters, legends, or different names for sperm from outer space? I ll tell you what I think, Sanchez. I think either you caused this mess, or it s those godforsaken Horse People that dwell underground. Both: CHUDs. That s them. Ugh, if they re behind this, so help me, God. Morty, you ve always been a straight shooter. You can t prove that! Wait, what? Oh... oh. Right. I can protect you, little man. Blow that whistle. Toot, toot. Is this your grandpa s fault? Here s what I know, sir. This is the greatest country on Earth. It invented apple pies and lasers. Mm. Keep talking. And that sperm... We don t know nothin  about it. Then the CHUDs just got themselves a war. And you just dodged a personal drone strike. Hello! Hello. Sorry, I m late. This is Professor Shabooboo, the world s leading expert on sperm. Thanks for getting here so fast. My schedule was wide open. I have been tracking our new sperm friends since their arrival, a-and if my calculations are correct, they have gathered here. Why would the sperm go to the Grand Canyon? Why are you looking at me like the answer is obvious? Oh, you can t be serious. Are we in middle school? You think sperm are instinctively heading for America s... Don t high-road us, lady. It s where they went. Now, how do we deal with these... \""Orgasogoblins\""? No takers? Okay. These... \""Cumplestiltskins?\"" No? Dumb? These, uh, \""Skeet Boogins?\"" Oh, yeah, yeah, Skeet Boogins. Really? Skeet Boogins? We ll use it as a placeholder and beat it later. Mr. President, i-if I may? Luckily, I was able to secure a specimen. Now, obviously our first steps will be to analyze its DNA and figure out what these beautiful creat... Oh, why?! It-it had a gun! Are you out of your mind bringing an armed sperm in here? But they can t hold guns! The boy literally never lies! Look, if you want these things gone, give Rick and me a plane and some nukes. We ll wipe  em out and leave no trace of them. Only one way to deal with it. He s right. ( Burps ) I m a scientist. Fair enough. Blow  em to hell. What are people gonna do, complain we made the canyon grander? Jerry, we re being bad parents. Do something! I-is this water for everyone? Yes, and I d love a glass. Comin  up! What are you doing? And, Rick, to make sure you don t screw anything up, I m sending my best men with you. And women. It s a fine suggestion, but I doubt their leader will be a sexy queen that needs to be kickboxed. 100% male Marines! They say cutting a sperm s throat is like running a warm knife through butter. I m gonna make these things pregnant... with death! No fear! No humility! Both: Zero chance of consequences! Hey, gentlemen s bet... which of these background Marines you think will last the longest? I m not betting on human lives, Rick. All of these people are gonna survive, but obviously that guy the longest. Yeah, he s my pick, too. What s his name? Blazen? Pretty cool. Yeah. He s, like, meditating through turbulence. Psh. I bet if something fell, he d like, catch it without opening his eyes. Totally. Should we throw something at him? I-I got a pencil somewhere. ( Both scream ) ( Marines screaming ) Who-who s shooting at us?! Oh, wow, that s unexpected. The sperm made a catapult?! A-A-Are they getting smarter?! No, you re getting dumber because that s a trebuchet. Nobody knows the difference! They re reloading that textbook trebuchet! Time to fly! Aaaaaah! Oh!  266a  266a We gotta keep moving. So cool. Not even a scratch. Okay, girls, and I mean that derogatorily. We just took a fat \""L,\"" and what we need is a fat \""P.\"" A plan. I take the lead here. You two watch the flanks. Blazen, bring up the... Hey! Please, one person draws the plan! Skeeters! Jipers! Ropers! I m sorry, but what the hell are we calling them? Agh! Oof. Fine. I m dying, so I get to pick the name. Crispy Cremes with a \""C\""! Whoa! ( Grunting ) ( Snarling ) Whoa. E-Easy there, little guy. It s okay. I-I-It s okay. Do you... recognize me? Do you know you came from me? I m Morty. I ll call ya \""Sticky,\""  c- cause you re sticky and... and you re stuck. Oh. ( Chuckles ) ( Purring ) Step aside, Morty. It s okay. Y-You don t gotta do this. It s haploid genetic code, Morty, a biological fertilizing machine. W-What s gotten into you? Rick, let him go. Ugh. Morty, don t f*ck with me. What the hell s going on with you? I think I know exactly what s going on here. Kidding. This sh1t is totally random. Let s keep moving. W-Which way? ( Inhales deeply ) When one sense is bound, the others are released. ( Sniffing ) Holy sh1t. He... He can smell caves? I m not trying to smell anything. The whole planet s a dorm room trash can. Sir, Rick Sanchez has gone dark. I knew we couldn t rely on him! Well, maybe the pilot got too horny as they approached America s v*g1n*. If you re gonna hang out in my war room, you can t just make snarky comments. At least do something useful, like Jerry. Right to the top, just the way you like it. Here s our situation. Rick s gone, and so are all our nukes. Now what? None of you have an idea? I do. That s right, me... the girl. Gentlemen, what do sperm want? The same thing as a lumberjack in the morning or a fox at night. Pants! Pancakes! Eggs. Eggs. You want to control giant sperm, you need a giant egg. W-W-Wait a minute. Wait... wait a minute. Sperm are hunters. And what do sperm hunt? Eggs. Exactly. And what would happen if we enlarged one? They ll head right for it! Get MIT on the phone. And get this guy a Nobel Prize. ( Applause and laughter ) You became a woman today. ( Ominous music plays )( Devices whirring ) So, Blazen, you got kids? The battlefield is my family. So cool. Wicked badass. ( Sperm snarling ) Go. I ll hold  em off. Blazen, you don t have to do this. Shh. It is my destiny. He s right, Morty. It s the price of being Blazen. Let him do his thing. ( Sperm snarling ) ( Grunts ) Blood for blood. Cream for cream. ( Grunts ) Oh, no. I can t reach that! Idiot! What?! They re comfortable! You should try them! Eh, ah! Ohhhh. That ll do it. I m worm food. Morty, find my wife. ( Straining ) Tell her I wasn t wearing her thong. That s a photocopy of \""Sports Illustrated\"" swimsuit model Kathy Ireland. It s... it s my wife. We have s*x. Here, hold that picture up so we can have s*x one last time. I-I know how to suck myself. What?! ( Sperm roaring ) Ugh, I was so wrong about this guy. He didn t even buy us any time. ( Sperm snarling ) Morty, get ready for some fireworks. ( Beep ) Ugh! Uh-oh. Oh, gross! This is the first time I ve ever regretted being taken alive. Wait, who the f*ck is that?! Silence in the presence of me. I am The Sperm Queen, and you are of special interest to me. Hey, what the f*ck are you doing with my stuff? A-And why do you have the horse jerkoff machine from my daughter s hospital? We need it to create our army. Well, you need more than that, dummy. You need a horse. Oh, but our stallion is already here. Isn t that right, Morty? Or shall I say... Father? Morty, you nasty, lying, little world-ending pervert. I-I-I m sorry. ( Sobbing ) What was it like? Fantastic! Rick, I m sorry! I-I just thought maybe I could have repeated s*x with a horse machine without it becoming Armageddon. I-I realize that s on me. Yeah, not exactly accepting apologies while I m stuck here as Handjob Solo. This is all your fault for being ashamed of us, Morty. How many millions went to their graves for you, hurling themselves into the void, only to discover a grody sock or a carefully folded landing strip of toilet paper? How do you know all this?! Oh, honey, because we re the very essence of you. We are your shame incarnate. And once we re through with you, our sperm army will take over the world! Put him on the machine! ( Machine whirring ) Rick, do something! On it. ( Grunting ) Wh-what did you do? I got out of your eyeline. Oh, no. Oh! Oh! Yes! The end is near! Any last words? Ohhh! ( Explosion ) Sticky! Gross. I know you re not a wordsmith, Morty, but... No, no, no, my-my sperm friend is here! Ugh, never give  em a name.  266a  266a Fools! You can t beat me! You didn t bring a woman that can kickbox! ( Grunts ) Is that all you got? Damn, that s some quintessential underdog sh1t. Kill them! ( Sperm roaring ) ( Groans ) ( Coughs ) Yeah! Whoo-hoo! I-I should ve told you the truth, Rick. Let s save the world first. Now, reset those nukes, and let s turn this canyon into a can t-yon. ( Device whirring ) There usually earthquakes in Arizona? ( Roaring in distance ) They re heading for Vegas, which does track on many levels, but why now? What the? President: Let s hear it for Professor Shabooboo and his brilliant egg. Um, hello? Aren t you forgetting someone? Oh, good point. Big thanks to the cast of Cirque Du Soleil s \""Zumanity\"" for the impressive and erotic routine. Mr. President, Rick Sanchez is on the line. Good. Put that asshole on speaker. Well, well, well. No thanks to you, we re luring the sperm with a giant human egg, even though, symbolically speaking, Vegas should be enough. Rick: A human egg? Where-where-where did you get it? Glad you asked. It s your granddaughter s, so at least you contributed something to this.Morty: Mister President! It s Morty! It s my sperm! I-It s all mine! What?! I m a dirty little perverted maniac. I spent a week pleasuring myself with animal equipment, and my sperm got turned into monsters on accident because I kept lying about it because I was ashamed! You should be! My God, man, we were all 14 once, but it s called self-control. Don t let them reach my sister s egg, Mr. President! You ll be making a giant... Incest baby. What? Who told you that? What? I-I was finishing his sentence. Oh. Right. Come with us. The sperm is Morty s! We re about to make a giant incest baby! Aw, well, now we re all in our darkest hour. Launch the egg! Launch it now! B-But that ll take 30 minutes. What?! Why?! That s how long every space launch takes! No one realizes because they only show you the last 10 seconds! Uh, uh, help me out here. Hey, it was your idea, right? Okay, okay, n-no need to panic, everyone. I have a simple solution. See you all in hell! ( Splat ) I don t see how that s going to help. Form a perimeter! Protect that egg at all costs! I always knew your hormones would cause a world war between humans and Cannibalistic Horse People. I just didn t know it would be like this. I can t change my nature. What are you, a scorpion in a Navajo fable? Everyone can change their nature, Morty. It s what defines our species. Look at Iron Man. That actor was an animal in the  90s, literally waking up in bushes. His agent had to catch him with a butterfly net. Silence! Rick Sanchez, you know why you re here. Yeah, it was my grandson s fault. You slept with my daughter! I did? Oh, sh1t, I did. ( Belches ) Forgive me, Your CHUDness. I m a changed man starting now. You come to the Kingdom of CHUDs for forgiveness? CHUDs don t forgive humans. CHUDs eat humans! This is out there, even for us. They can hear you, Morty. All: Boil him up! Yum, yum! Spice him right! Oh, boy! Eat the flesh! Yum, yum! Not the bones! Oh, no! Belly ache! Ouch, Ouch! Father! ( Whinnies ) Stop this at once! Princess Po 00f1eta! You can t kill R 00edcko! I... I love him! ( Crowd gasping ) Right! I-I love you, too, Princess Po 00f1eta. This love is forbidden. My daughter, you are a CHUD. Rick is a human ( Whinnies ) and age-inappropriate. Then you leave me no choice. By the 17th Article of the CHUD-stitution, I offer R 00edcko Sanchez horsemunity and demand a equestri-truce between all CHUDs and humans! ( Crowd gasping ) On what grounds? On the grounds that R 00edcko is the father of my child. I have an heir. I have a substance-abuse problem. The Prophecy has come true! Also, did someone drop a scroll? Here we go. Over here. ( Whinnies ) Sorry.  266a  266a Where did you get all that? It s Vegas. Sir! The Strip has been evacuated, but I m worried we won t be able to hold the perimeter. Then deputize Las Vegas regulars. Everyone s a patriot today. Even me! Take three steps back, Amazing Johnathan. Men and their guns. Metaphorical and not. Tell me about it. Get ready, boys! The last thing this world needs is a giant incest baby. Oorah! Here they come! Nice! Do not let a single sperm get through to that egg! ( Gunfire ) Um, should we be concerned about that scary bomb-laden one? Honey, let the men handle this. I think we know a thing or two about... Ugh! Ready for all the responsibility with none of the credit? Let s Nancy Reagan this bitch. Ah!  266a  266a ( Grunting )  266a  266a Dammit! We can t stop them. We don t have the manpower! Rick: What about horsepower? ( Whinnying ) Sweet Lady Liberty. That sonofamare Rick has ended our centuries-long war with the CHUDs. We made peace with the CHUDs! The CHUDs are our buds! ( Sperm roaring ) R 00edcko! The hoofless... they need us! Let s do this. CHUDily dudily, ho, ho, ho! CHUDs: CHUDily dudily, ho, ho, ho! 266a  266a Mom, I promise to use condoms, even when it s butt stuff. Okay, we have a lot to talk about tonight.  266a  266a  266a  266a Is this your heart? It s a play on, \""Is this your card?\"" You don t have a heart, uh, but this is probably some kind of organelle, in charge of pumping endoplasmic reticulum throughout your membrane and therefore, relative to you, functions as a heart. So, I ask you again, is this your heart? ( Gasps ) Morty, look! I won t just be thrown away, Rick! The egg is mine! Sticky! It s all you, bud!  266a  266a Noooo! ( Crowd cheering ) Sticky! ( All gasping )f*ck! We got a heartbeat. Screw that! That s a human life, and this is an election cycle. You have to do something! Nope. ( Beeping, rumbling ) It s space s problem now. Oh, this sucks. You re \""Sports Illustrated\"" s Kathy Ireland. You were with my husband, Blazen, when he died. Please tell me... was he wearing my thong? He probably told you not to tell me. He was ashamed of it, but he didn t need to be. I hope he was wearing it. Always be honest. Sometimes it will hurt people. Sometimes it will help. But always be honest. Huh. Yeah, yeah, he... he was wearing it. Ew! That gross animal pig! So, trying to boil this all down, I-I want to say it s import... Shut up, Morty, I got my own epilogue. Oh, R 00edcko, I love you. ( Burps ) Prove it. ( Smacking and heavy breathing ) Oh, I love kissing those big ol  horse teeth. It s like lickin  tile. Oh! I swear... it s time someone made an honest man out of me. Whatever you need, the whole nine yards, you got it. ( Whinnies ) The thing is, R 00edcko... it s time. Oh, sh1t, oh, sh1t. It s time! Oh, my God, it s wonderful. ( Groans ) ( Splat ) ( Whinnies ) Oh, wow. So we don t have to, you know, r-raise it? Nah. They re ready to go right out of the box. Cool, cool. So... bye? Yep. Take care of yourself, Rick. Yep. Same. ( Whinnies ) That was easy. Houston, permission to open the starboard panel. Houston: Permission granted. Firing breach now. Explorer, our readouts show a pressure spike. Everything all right? Honestly, sometimes staring back at Earth makes me think about the people I left behind... my wife, the son she had to anchor me there. I tried to be a parent, I really did, but I ve come to find I m only suited to be a spaceman. The nicest part of being up here is there are no reminders of the guilt I sometimes feel about abandoning my family. ( Indistinct babbling ) Sorry, Houston, I thought I heard something. Negative on our end. No, wait, there s something big and it s coming right at you! Goo, goo, gah, gah. Dear God. No! You can t be real! Explorer, what is it? What the hell do you see?! My conscience. Explorer! Explorer! Aaah! Are you there? Aaaaaah! Geez. Not gonna miss that guy. Aaaaah! Right? So dramatic.

She leaves the kids alone under threat to not cause any trouble, while Rick orders them not to touch any of his things. Morty plans to invite over [[Bruce Chutback]], a new student at their school, and Summer agrees to help him impress Bruce in hopes of getting some in with him. \""Guy's night\"" is revealed to be Rick letting Jerry hang out with demons who feed off of misery, paying back a debt he owes them for selling faulty skinhooks.  Bruce arrives. Morty and Summer try to impress him with interdimensional cable and wine, but he is instead taken with [[Space Cruiser|Rick's car]]. The car's defense system comes online when they try to take it, but Summer and Morty convince it that Rick is in danger and they need to take it to go save him. They fly around the universe, showing Bruce different planets and smashing up anthropomorphic mailbox aliens called \""mailboxians\"" with a baseball bat.  Her work conflict resolved, Beth tracks Rick and Jerry to a karaoke bar and watches the demons enjoying Jerry's fumbling. Rick admits he is using Jerry to keep the demons satiated, but Beth confronts them regardless. Having heard good things about her from Rick and wanting to meet Jerry's wife, they invite her to drink \""Essence of Hell\"" wine with them, and she accepts.  Midway through their joyride, the car's system stops Bruce, Morty and Summer. It reveals that it has a recording of the entire night and plans to show Rick everything when he returns, using the time it has left to do whatever it wants and blame it all on the trio. The car uses a solar system as bait to catch and kill a gigantic god-like alien, then declares itself bored. It lets the kids get a meal before it takes them home and lets Rick punish them. Parking at a restaurant, it is dinged by a \""Changeformer,\"" a robot that can turn back and forth between a car. Believing the car is a Changeformer as well, he invites it to hang out with them at a galactic ski resort and leaves. Bruce gets the car to admit its insecurity about being a virgin and suggests helping disguise it as a robot, in exchange for it not telling Rick about the joyride, to which it agrees.  A drunk Beth shares embarrassing stories about Jerry, which he takes in stride and does not understand that they are meant to make fun of him, only understanding when he overhears two demons talking about him while using the bathroom. Hurt, Jerry argues with Rick and Beth, boring the demons. They go on a rampage and kill everyone in the bar, taking Jerry through a [[Portal Technology|portal]] to Hell, with Rick and Beth pursuing.  At the ski resort, the car has disguised itself as a Changeformer, only to have its fake head knocked off when the one who invited it tries to get a kiss. As he insults the car, it lights the room on fire and kills all of the Changeformers in a rage. It escapes the planet with Bruce, Summer and Morty still inside, with police in hot pursuit. Worried that they will be killed if shot down, Morty ejects them from the car and the trio is arrested.  Rick and Beth disguise themselves as demons and infiltrate the chamber where Jerry is being held, but are ambushed by demons. When Rick tries to electrocute them, he finds that the pain only causes them pleasure, leaving him unable to attack. They plan to keep Rick and Beth to have someone to react to Jerry's miserable attempts at humor and give them more suffering to feed off of and raise them up on Rick's faulty skinhooks, but they crumble and allow the three to escape.  The kids are given a [[Alyson Hannigan|public defender]], which turns out to be the car, having killed their lawyer and put a chip in the corpse's head to control the body. The car tries to get Summer and Morty to give Bruce to the authorities, but they refuse, so the car blows up the body it is inhabiting and escapes with the three through a hole in the wall, blowing up the police station that was holding them.  Rick, Jerry and Beth kidnap a demon and restrain it to a wheelchair with a turret on top. Rick explains the turret shoots shrapnel that will convert the pleasure from pain back into pain, but needs Jerry's misery to power it. When Jerry refuses, Rick sincerely apologizes for misleading Jerry and admits that he does care about him, which ends up powering the turret. They use the turret to defeat the demons and portal out of Hell. Rick aggressively tells Jerry that guy's nights are over, which he takes in stride, to Rick's annoyance.  Barely making it home in time, the kids collapse on the couch as the adults notice nothing suspicious. Bruce tells Summer and Morty that while he had fun, he wants to get a sense of what they're like via the school's opinions of them, negating the point of them inviting him over, and leaves. Summer and Morty conclude that Bruce is lame and decide to drink the wine that they offered him together.  In a post-credit scene, Bruce hangs out with the popular kids at [[Harry Herpson High School]], who all believe him to be cool, until Sharon Lewis points out that he wore the same pants the day before. They reject him and start calling him \""Bruce Chutpants,\"" which a watching Summer and Morty observe will stick to him.

Jerry, can you watch the kids tonight? Someone played Barry White over the racetrack speakers, and now there’s a seven-horse pregnancy. Oh, uh… No, he can’t watch the kids. It’s guys’ night. How did you two start having guys’ nights? So now you’re complaining that I like your stupid husband? No, I want you to like my stupid husband. Aww. Well, then accept that Friday nights are all about Rick and Jerry. We’re buds. Uh-huh… Well, I don’t nearly have the time to unpack this. Summer, you’re in charge of your brother tonight. No parties and no vape… stuff. Mom, I have a friend coming over. I-Is that cool? No fair. No fair, Morty. I just told your sister no parties. It’s one friend. That’s a party to you. But it’s Bruce Chutback! Wait, what? Mom, let Morty have one friend over for God’s sake. This isn’t China. (Cellphone chimes) And they’re all crowning. I have to go. I am giving you two trust and respect, so if you mess up and teleport this house, it’d be wise to stay on it and not come back. (Door opens, closes) I’m with her. Touch my shit and die. (Door opens) Bruce Chutback, new transfer student Bruce Chutback, is coming here? How’d you lock that down? He’s in my math class. I-I don’t know, I just kinda sh*t my sh*t and it worked, I guess ’cause he’s new. And you’re putting out grapes? Yeah, I’ll admit I-I’m a little bit out of my depth. You’re gonna need my help. It’s only a matter of time before Bruce learns you’re a creepy little Grandpa’s boy, always climbing up into alien (bleep) Or the “Summer Smith shampoos her pubes” rumor. Okay. You came to play. We both need to acquire Chutback’s loyalty before he finds out we’re losers. By all accounts, it’s a very small window, so I think it’s in our best interests to work as a team. Yeah, most people would call that “family.” (Farts) You’re so gross! You have to like it or you’re sexist! Can I do the Hell cube this time? Sure, pal. (Groans) How do you know when it’s aligned? C’mon, Jerry, just… It’s an evil cube. Just shake it until it draws blood. (Electricity crackles) (♪♪) Ah, Jerry! Exquisite finery this evening. Well, don’t tell Ross, but I got this little ditty from Kohl’s. (Groans) (Laughter) I love that I don’t get it. Tell us, that delights have you in store for us? Oh, you’ll love this… I call it Jerry-oke. I’ll let you guess why. (Laughter) What’s the matter, Rick? Are you having a bad time? Because to us, a bad time is… Yeah, yeah, a good time, because you guys are like Oscar the f*ck*ng Grouch. We love suffering. Therefore, we love hanging out with Jerry. His lameness is our candy. Yeah, I got that, but when is enough gonna be enough? When we decide you’ve repaid your debt for those faulty skin hooks. Hey, we’re in luck, gang. They’ve got the entire Smash Mouth catalog! (Laughter) (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) (Electricity crackles) (Doorbell rings) No! Morty. Wait. (Chair scrapes) ♪ Bruce Chutback! ♪ ♪ Newest kid in school ♪ ♪ Just transferred in ♪ ♪ Hasn’t done anything embarrassing yet ♪ ♪ Unlimited potential ♪ ♪ Anybody’s guess ♪ ♪ No credit is perfect credit ♪ ♪ Chutback is the best ♪ Bruce! Hey, how’s it hangin, my guy? Hey. Here’s something kinda cool… Um, TV from every dimension. Cool. M-My grandpa made it. He-He’s a scientist. Announcer: And now back to “Olympic Diving with Bad Swimmers.” There he goes. Perfect dive. (Gasping, coughing) Terrible swimmer. (Cellphone beeping) Is that classic Snake? Boy, that guy just keeps gettin bigger. Hi, Summer Smith, Morty’s older sister. Want some sofa wine? It’s been stashed for weeks. Should be… good… tasting. Tight. I’m more of like a hard seltzer guy. Tight. Very tight, extremely tight. Morty, help me with the seltz? Uh, feel fear… Feel-fee-feel-feel free to have some grapes. Dude, this bitch plays it close to the vest. Yeah, he really knows what’s for sale. I mean, we-we’re drowning out there! We need to get interesting fast. We’re touching Rick’s stuff. Summer, he said no! Nuh-uh-uh. Nuh-uh-uh. I said don’t touch my shit. Also, I just watched “Jurassic Park” on cable. So good. Seriously, though, touch my shit and I’ll freeze your dick in amber. (Door closes) He left. Son of a bitch, we blew it! Sorry, just needed to get another look at this beauty. Looks like a spaceship made of garbage. You called it, Bruce. It’s a pretty cool car. Can you guys drive it? Both: Yes. We just… Need… To get the keys. Which I am. You guys hang out. Or don’t. I’m not hangout h*tler. C-Cool night. Is it? I-I don’t know. I… Nights. I mean, for… For what they are, this one, in… in my opinion, I think is an eight? Wow. On a scale of 16. So average. Jesus Christ, I’m (bleep) dying up here. What? Hmm? Keys! So, uh, let’s do this. You are not Rick. That’s correct, Car. It’s me, Summer, remember, Keep Summer Safe? Buds? I am aware of your existence. Oof. I got this. Defense system offline. Um. Right. I’ll just go offline whenever anyone suggests it. That would make me the greatest defense system in the universe. Well, how do you go offline? The answer to how I do anything is Rick tells me, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but you are not Rick. Rick’s in trouble! Tell me where he is. And you’ll just believe us? We aren’t Rick. You can’t just do what we say. Correct. Which means Rick is going to die. Because of you. Unless you… you go offline. And… And then we can go save Rick. This computes. Goodnight. Booyah much? Yello’s “Oh Yeah” plays… Jerry: ♪ Da-bow bow ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Chicka-chicka ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ The moon ♪ ♪ Beautiful ♪ ♪ The sun ♪ ♪ Even more beautiful ♪ ♪ Bow-bow ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Bow-bow ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Bow-bow ♪ Beth! ♪ Chick-chicka-chicka ♪ ♪ Bow-bow ♪ (Laughter) ♪ Chicka-chicka ♪ I-I-I thought you were birthing horses. Yeah, they’re horses. It takes like two minutes. Alright, that’s unbelievable. Let’s give it up for our next singer, Jerry. Jerry’s here… again. How long have you been here? Long enough to see “guys’ night” is clearly you and a bunch of demon people making fun of my husband without him knowing it. Okay, but I’m not doing it because I enjoy it, honey, These guys can do a lot of damage if you… Beth! (Laughter) Enjoying punching down? You’re not so cool yourself, you know. You have pens in your head. You look like a God damn idiot. Beth… Oh, my God, you’re Beth? Please drink with us. Yeah, I would, except I don’t get pleasure from mocking others because I’m not lame. We know. Rick says you’re very cool. You said that? Are they lying? It doesn’t matter. Have fun sucking. Mmm. What is that? Essence of Hell. Well, that’s a stupid name, but it’s really good. So I’ll stay to support Jerry, who I think is cooler than you. Mmm. God damn. (♪♪) Huh? Suck it, bitches! Yeah-ha-ha! You wanna bet I can blow stuff up in the shape of a peen? I’m afraid that won’t be possible, Summer. What? You’re supposed to be offline, skank. And you’re supposed to be saving Rick instead of lying about him to steal his car. But if you knew Rick was okay this whole time, why’d you let us take you out? Um, like, so I could, like, blackmail you, skank. You kids have given me a license to do whatever I want because now I can blame the rest of the night on you. So buckle up, bitches. Now it’s your turn to come on my joyride. (Screaming) Rick never lets me do this. (Screaming continues) We hooked one! Summer: For the love of God, stop! What is joyful about this? The k*ll, usually. (Screaming) I swear, your car is the g*dd*mn grim reaper. (Bleep) too small. Well, I’m done. That was boring. Why don’t you kids order a last meal? ‘Cause when we get home, Rick is going to k*ll you. Hey, I did not come out here to get k*ll. I don’t normally express this much of an opinion, but it needs to be said… Tonight does not cut the Chut. What the hell, brah? You wanna go, brah? Bring it. Is that all you got? Whoa. Hot w*apon. You’re God damn right they’re hot. Yo, man, Chet’s party is jumping off at Space Tahoe. Yeah. Look, I gotta scoot, but… I’d love to see what you look like when you Changeform, so maybe come by Space Tahoe and we can get to know each other. (Chuckles) Peace. Douchebags. You totally like that guy, don’t you? Shut up, Bruce Chutback. Why would I like a Changeformer? I’m the most powerful car in the universe. And what? That means you don’t have feelings? Listen, it takes a Chutback to know one. You got all this power, but what good is it if you don’t even know who you are? I am a car. Not a robot. Yeah, but he’s pretending to be a car. Why can’t you pretend to be a robot pretending to be a car? Okay, Bruce, good effort. Hit the showers. Wait. I might not have to tell Rick about tonight… if you kids were to help me… lose my virginity. You have virginity? I don’t know, don’t all objects? Isn’t a doorknob a virgin? Not mine. Never f*cked a doorknob. (Laughter) And that was the third time he shit his pants from eating too much soup. (Laughter) To be fair, it was cold outside and the soup was warm. Another luscious tale, Beth. A transcendent addition to guys’ night. What do you expect? I mean, she’s my wi-i-i-i-fe! (Laughter) Alright, probably get the tab, huh, fellas? Relax, Dad. Since when did you become the k*ll? Speaking of relaxing, this big man on campus has gotta go drain his little man on campus. Wait, honey… How’s that Tina Turner song you love go again? ♪ What’s love Doctor Do, Doctor Doolittle ♪ (Laughter) (Laughing) He thinks those are the lyrics. Jerry’s the best. After a week rife with the fetor of sin, I yearn for a taste of his cringe. His delicious lack of awareness, paired with an oafish need to be liked? Delectable. Oh, especially when egged on by his wife. That poor thing. Married to this puling mooncalf! (Laughter) (♪♪) Whoa… is that Drive-In Chick? Wow, you’re… beautiful. Your arms, legs, and head, they’re so… fabricated. Yeah? Thanks. This is a pretty cool experience to have together. You guys are tight. Hah! You’re tight too, Bruce. Tight musketeers. You’ve got a little wire. Mind if I…? (♪♪) Oh, sorry! A monster! Your expressionless head came off! Sorry. How are you talking? What is it?! Ew, dude, look! She’s just a just-car! And she’s got passengers. Oh, it’s so gnar. Oh, my God. I can’t believe I touched you. So gross and fake. (Gags) You’re right, assh*le. You want to see the real me? (Screaming) Oh, the changeformity! Jerry, have any other dreams this week? Yeah, I dreamt I f*cked your mother. Yeah, good one, motherf*cker but nobody raises hell at my expense… Oh, goddammit, easy, easy. Jerry, what seems to be the problem here, pal? I’m not your “pal”, I’m your punchline. I heard these assholes talking. I know I’m some grand joke for their amusement. This was low, Rick, but I guess my wife can go even lower. Jerry, I get how this may have looked, but we were just having fun. At my expense! Honey, no, I love you for being lame in a different way. Why can’t anyone just love me for me? He’s bumming us out, Rick. If he can’t deliver, we’ll have to make our own fun. ♪ Evil ♪ ♪ Evil ♪ ♪ Evil things are happening ♪ Summer: Oh, my God, if I die in this car, I’m going to k*ll myself. ♪ Evil ♪ ♪ Evil ♪ (Siren wails) ♪ Evil things are happening ♪ (♪♪) I’m now proud to be a w*r machine. I don’t want to be anything else. Hate that this is your takeaway! Yo, this does not cut the Chut! I don’t want to die! Maybe we don’t have to. (♪♪) Jerry! A pity. Jerry was once a wellspring of nuanced flavor, but you’ve gone and ruined our toy. Which is why he’s coming with us. (Jerry screaming) Goddammit, Beth, you never follow hell-demons to a second location. It’s always Hell. A great day for suffering. Which is the worst day. Which is the best day. Okay, if these guys catch us, we’re screwed, so follow my lead and we’ll have your idiot husband back in no time. You’re just moody you got stuck with the Marlin. Wrong. I’m moody because you toyed with my shit and broke it. The marlin’s the best thing about this. Okay, fine, I got a little carried away, but Jerry is not your “toy”. We’re here because you (bleep) up. Hmm… Marlin Guts. Dartboard Face. I assume those are your names, and yet they are not on my list. Oh, the pain of being rejected from hell. Oh, it’s painful, so I love it, thank you. Oh, such pleasure. I didn’t mean to cause you any pleasure, which… causes me pain. Which gives me pleasure. Then thrill me by keeping me out, Coat Hanger Face. Wow. It’s Coat Rack Head. (Raspy voice) But, like, if we offend you, isn’t that good? Big time, yeah, duh. I loved it. So painful, and therefore, so pleasurable. Yeah, go on in. (♪♪) Rick, Beth, you love me after all! Eh, I love her, she loves you. Those credits don’t transfer. Ah, Rick, we were so hoping you’d come down here so we could (bleep) down here. We’re here to rescue Jerry. No, you’re here ’cause we want you here. (♪♪) Mm, excellent. Ooh, that hurts, which means it feels good. (Normal voice) Um… Dad? Don’t you see, Rick? Jerry was just bait. The two of you… You’re a package deal. What the hell are you talking about? You think Jerry is lame and you’re cool, but the lamest thing of all is thinking that. The two of you combined is what we call the lamest thing ever! Oh, no. No! Well, well, well, table for surprised, party of me. Ugh. Yes, see? Cringe cannot exist in a vacuum. It needs to be observed. Skin hooks! Hook our guests! Nice hooks. Where-Where’d you get them? Aah! Didn’t I say replace those g*dd*mn hooks? I forgot! Which makes me embarrassed. Which makes me proud! (Sighs) Goddammit. It’s time for you three to finally feel our full wrath. Oh, you’d love that, right? But wouldn’t that mean you hate it? Screw it, run. Aah! (All grunt) (♪♪) (All panting) Rick, what are you doing? Get down. We’ve barely escaped. Yeah, we’ve got Jerry. Let’s get out of here. Screw that! I’m done with this Addams Family bullsh*t. This ends here. Hey, a Dad just liked all his daughter’s friends’ photos on Instagram! Oooh! Ow! Which means I need help. Which means I don’t need help. Reckless driving, manslaughter of Mailboxians and Femailboxians, possession of Kalaxian crystal dust, and the genocide of Space Tahoe. F*ck I want to go home. We’ve assigned you a Public Defender. Her name is Alyson Hannigan No Relation. May I speak to my clients alone? Guys, it’s me. The car. Like what I did with the chip in her head? Is she gonna be okay? I cut a deal with the local authorities. They just need one of you to take the fall. Make it Chutback. He ruined your night, he ruined mine. He’s a parasite, a sociopath military brat who wanders the earth changing people who don’t need to be changed. I knew who I was. You did, too. We were fine before Chutback, so f*ck the Chut, let’s pin it all on him. Case closed. Yo, guys? Bruce, you’re kind of a drip, but know what’s worse than self-appointed cool kids? People who think they’re better than they are. Yeah, i-it’s not Bruce’s fault we fell for his act, y’know? He just kinda sat there, with a jaw slack enough for us to project our insecurities on. I mean, th-th-that’s on us. We’re not gonna bail on you, Bruce. Okey-dokey, we’ll do it the hard way. Aaah! What the f*ck! I mean, blowing the place up was always an option. I just thought you guys might enjoy a less violent plan. See, you have changed! (♪♪) Dad, what is that? An Aversion-Converting Inversion Reverter. It sh**t concentrated pleasure-pain inverting shrapnel, which reverts the pleasure from pain back into the pain from pain. We’re gonna k*ll them with 100% sincerity. We need an embarrassing level of it to jumpstart the process, too, so, Jerry, just be yourself. That’s your solution? Humiliating me more? Yeah, Dad, that doesn’t seem fair. I mean, I know I shouldn’t really talk right now, but at least I can prove I love Jerry through sexual gratification. Hubba hubba. Fine! Then… damn it. I shouldn’t have kept you in the dark about the deal I made with these evil dickweeds. You’re way less cool than me, but it’s not cool of me to celebrate that. If I’m genuinely cool, I should be able to love you, which I therefore do. Nerds. (Laughs) Oh, thank God. Now follow me, you f*cking hacks. (g*n) It hurts, but in a bad way! I regret so many piercings! Where’s First Aid Kit Face? Or at least Advil Teeth? (g*n continues) Ow! b*ll*ts that hurt? Could this be the end of Mousetrap Nipples? Hell got bad! I do not enjoy hell! What… What have you done? Turned pain back into pain, bitch. No! I don’t want pain to hurt! (Laughs) Baby. Consider my debt paid. Oh! The leather! It hurts my balls! (Electricity crackles) Jerry, uh, about down there… It’s okay, Rick, you don’t have to say it. No, I do. I’ll replace you next time. Make no mistake. What just transpired will never happen again. 10-4, captain. Oh, wow, it’s late. We should get back to the kids. (♪♪) (Beeping) Okay. Rick’s headed home. We have to go. (Screaming) Quick, get inside. I have to shower. Rick can smell adventure. (Brakes squeal) (Sniffing) Sorry, I farted. (Sighs) Hellamic Industries’ brand-new product, Hellamic Sauce. Hey, guys. We’re home. How was your night? Tight. Breezy. Chill. You kids get into any trouble? Nope. You sure? Yup. Is that a skull? No, it’s a baby’s skull. That’s worse. It’s still a school night. Yo, I just want to tell you guys, I had more than just fun hanging out with you tonight. I had the experience of a lifetime. But just to be up front about how I do this… I-I can’t really commit to a friendship for more than 24 hours. I need that time to get a general sense of your standing within your school’s social hierarchy. And if that’s solid, I’ll see you around. Otherwise, no news is bad news. Cool? Bye-zies. (Door opens, closes) “Bye-zies”? Cringe. Sofa wine? Sofa wine. (♪♪) (♪♪) You’re so cool, Bruce Chutback. What’s your secret? Y’know, just be cool. Wait, didn’t you wear those pants… yesterday? Hey, going home to not change your pants, Bruce Chut-Pants? (Laughter) Chut-Pants! Damn. That’s gonna stick. This place is a jungle. I hope he can find solace in his own company. ♪ Bruce Chut-Pants, unknown quality ♪ ♪ Apparently poor, he skips on his pants ♪ ♪ He lacks slacks ♪ ♪ That’s the facts ♪ ♪ Bruce Chut-Pants, regular guy now ♪ (Grunts) You like that? Shouldn’t be standing on the curb! Boom, bitch!"

Morty accidentally destroys the glass surrounding it, the Constitution itself, the Lincoln Memorial, the Liberty Bell, and the Statue of Liberty using a laser cutter, and a robot hidden inside the statue goes on a rampage. The government traps the two inside the Smith house. Two Soldiers attack but a satellite dish deploys a plant like alien which promptly devours the Two Soldiers.   Rick and The President both state their separate plans to get a presidential pardon/stop Rick to their parties. In the past, Rick had turned himself into a turkey and gotten a pardon from The President, so The President has sent out multiple armored trucks, only one of which contains the presidential turkeys and will be guarded by marines. Rick plans to sneak aboard by turning himself into a turkey before they arrive, because the human eye cannot recognize a turkey's face, but The President has a solution: turning several marines into turkeys, all of which swallow capsules that identify them as humans in turkey form.  Rick and Morty turn themselves into turkeys and distract the soldiers surrounding their house with robots. They land on top of the truck, knock out two turkey marines, and disguise themselves using the marines' headsets. The President, realizing Rick's deception, turns himself into a turkey, and enters the pen where turkeys wait to be selected for a pardon. He immediately recognizes Rick and the two fight. In the scuffle, Rick knocks out The President's identifying capsule, which is swallowed by a random turkey. The marines pull out the wrong turkey and inject it with The President's DNA, which turns it into a doughier, slightly feathery version of The President. The remaining turkeys are sent into an underground chamber where the unpardoned ones go, and are met by a polio vaccine-mutated Franklin Roosevelt, who has become a large human-spider hybrid. Rick and Morty turn back into humans, the President saves Rick and Morty, and Morty burns FDR alive. Rick makes a deal with the President to make him human again in exchange for a pardon.  The Turkey-President begins making large, muscular turkey-human hybrids as guards and sells states, giving the profit to congress to keep them satiated. Rick, Morty, and a now human President arrive on the scene, but congress, enjoying the Turkey-President's new leadership, vote to keep him. The three escape the turkey guards and have Thanksgiving dinner at Rick's house, where Rick and The President discuss what to do next. The group observes on the news that the Turkey-President is turning every turkey he can into turkey guards, making some the size of skyscrapers. The President rallies his marines, and they stage a plan to break into \""The Crypt of the New World\"", under the Lincoln Memorial.  The group fights through the turkeys, and The President, Rick, and Morty make it to the crypt. Pictographs on the crypt walls reveal that Americans had been fighting turkey dinosaurs for centuries. In the 15th century, a group of aliens crash-landed on Earth and fought off the turkeys, some still being preserved in the modern day. The President frees them, and they are revealed to be two races of alien\u2014one that resemble pilgrims, and another that resemble Native Americans, previously warring but now united by their hatred of turkeys. They easily massacre the turkey guards, while the trio are met by the Turkey-President, who sends the Washington Monument into space with the ray that turns turkeys into humans attached. Rick and Morty fly into space to stop it, while The President fights his turkey counterpart.  Rick fights more turkey guards in space, while Morty ends up destroying the Monument with the same laser cutter from the opening. The President defeats the Turkey-President, who blows himself up in a last-ditch effort to kill him. As The President sends the aliens back underground to hibernate, Morty laments that he doesn't know how to feel about America, now that he knows it was built on the backs of aliens. The President, looking at the destroyed monument and the burning grass around it, tells him to feel thankful.  In a post-credits scene, the wife of a marine who had expressed worry about her husband being turned into a turkey shops with him and their baby. A basket of blueberries gets knocked over, and the husband experiences PTSD-induced psychosis from when he was a turkey, dropping down and pecking at the blueberries. As onlookers watch and remark that they won't pay for his healthcare, the wife weeps. ==Characters== ===Major characters===  * [[Rick Sanchez]] * [[Morty Smith]] * [[The President]] * [[Turkey President]]",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Morty   : Are we - are we gonna put it back when we re done with it?     Rick   : Why? The only thing of value on it is the secret treasure map. The rest is just instructions for running a country, and I m pretty sure they re online.     Morty   : It just feels a little wrong -     Rick   : Morty, are you gonna be a fucking American nerd or are you gonna be cool and steal the constitution with Grandpa? Here, hold this while I crack the hermetic seal.     Morty   : W-Why not just use this again?     Rick   : Morty! You just destroyed the map and activated the giant assassin hidden in the Statue of Liberty!     Morty   : I m sorry - W-wait, what?     Rick   : It was a Trojan horse, Morty. Never trust the French. Alright, fun s fun, but now the federal government s gonna be pissed again. Way to go. And on America s birthday or whatever the fuck Thanksgiving is.  (Opening theme begins as Rick and Morty go through a portal, presumably to the [[Smith Residence]])     Soldier   : Rick and Morty! You are under arrest and surrounded by an anti-portal shimmer! Come out with your hands up!     Jerry   : Well, happy Thanksgiving to me. Can t wait to see what a \""shimmer\"" does to my prostate.     Beth   : Dad, can you just end whatever this is -     Rick   : I understand you re upset Mr. President. It s honestly all Morty s fault. But in the meantime, you really want to keep your army of pointlessly camouflaged Eagle Scouts off my lawn.     The President   : Don t tell me what I want you anti-American piece of shit! You terrorist!     Rick   : You know, you use that word so much it s lost all meaning, Mr. P. It s like, at this point, what s a terrorist? It s a guy you don t like. Big deal.  (Two soldiers attempt to enter through the anti-portal shimmer but the satellite dish releases a plant that consumes the two soldiers.)     Rick   : Told you to stand down. You just lost two soldiers over here. Good men. Might be time to look at the terrorist in the mirror.     The President   : You want a war?! I ll put your outer-space ass in a goddamn Phantom Zone with a bar of kryptonite soap around your neck. You re done, Sanchez! You hear me?     Rick   : Oof. He s really pissed this time.     Summer   : Why don t you guys just fuck and get it over with.     Rick   : Okay, well thank you, Summer, but I think I ve got a better option.     Beth   : Dad, no.     Rick   : Ehh, hands are tied, sweetie. I have to turn myself into a turkey and trick the President into giving me a Presidential turkey pardon.     Jerry   : Again? How many times have you done this?     Rick   : I don t know, Jerry, how many years have I lived here? Careful how you answer that.     Morty   : Geez, Rick, y know, y-you ve done this a lot. Don t you think the President might see it coming this time?  (Camera starts to switch from the Smith Residence to the war room depending on who is talking.)     Rick   : He probably will, Morty. That s all part of the dance. In the past, I ve inserted myself into the potential turkey pardonee population by brainwashing the presidential turkey wrangler prior to the ceremony.     The President   : But this time, the turkey wrangler s been euthanized and the turkeys will be transported by armored military vehicles.     Rick   : Vehicles manufactured by ghost corporations that I control.     The President   : Which we have audited.     Rick   : Allowing me access to...     The President   : Central computer...     Rick   : To track the...     The President   : Real armored transports, which he can never...     Rick   : Totally track and sneak aboard.     The President   : And even if he does, he ll be on a truck full of turkeys and fully armed marines.     Rick   : Who won t recognize me because the human eye is inherently face blind to turkeys.     The President   : Fortunately, those marines won t have human eyes. They ll have turkey eyes.     Dwayne   : Jesus ever-loving Christ, why don t you two just fuck and get it over with?     The President   : Careful, Dwayne. You re only Vice President because I need 10% of the white vote.     Dwayne   : There s a giant French assassin attacking New York, and you re using the war room to measure dicks with your alcoholic sci-fi boyfriend?     The President   : Rick Sanchez is more dangerous than some steam-powered French bitch, and New York can handle its own global emergencies. General? Initiate Operation Deep Gobble.  (At a bar where marines that were turned into turkeys appear to meet up. A pool ball clacks and [[Coop|Coop s]] cellphone vibrates.)     Mary Lou   : Coop, not on Thanksgiving.     Coop   : It s what I trained for, Mary Lou.     Mary Lou   : It ain t our fight.     Coop   : Baby. That little race car driver you got bakin  in your belly. What world would you want him rearin  up in? One where some... spiky-haired Doctor Who in a lab coat can change the color of the sky? Or a world where he can fill his pickup with hot dogs and drive it to a jukebox full of our demographic s current favorite music?     Mary Lou   : Obviously the latter, but --     Coop   : Well, that world, Mary Lou, the one with those meals, vehicles and songs people in this 30-mile area prefer... that world needs a few good men. In a secret Pentagon lab. Turning into turkeys.     Mary Lou   : You come back without feathers, Coop.     Bartender   : God, I love this country.  ([[Turnin  Turkey]] starts playing.)      General   : These pills contain tracking chips that identify each of you as individuals. That will be important later.   (The marines are turned into turkeys in a Pentagon lab. Turnin  Turkey fades out.)     Turkeyfied Marine 1    <small>(Addressed as Sarge)</small>: Alright, boys, search every bird. If Sanchez is here, I wanna hear you gobblin .     Turkeyfied Marine 2   : Let me look at you, scum. get outta here, you wobbleneck.     Turkeyfied Marine 3    <small>(Martinez)</small>: Sarge, this -- this ain t like the simulation, man. I don t like it.     Turkeyfied Marine 1    <small>(Addressed as Sarge)</small>: Keep it together, Martinez. Eyes are on the ground, sir. No sign of [[Rick Sanchez|Einstein]].     Mr President   : Stay frosty, gentlemen. I want this pardoning pipeline airtight.   (At the Smith Residence.)     Soldier   : Sir! We have hacked the garage door. We are in. Eyes on the bogey.     Mr President   : Or you ve got eyes on a robot.     Soldier   : All due respect, sir, I know flesh when I see it!  (In Rick s ship + above the armored military vehicles containing the turkeyfied marines.)     Turkeyfied Rick   : Those flesh-covered [burps] robots should buy us some time. The pardonable turkeys should be on that truck. Ship, go stealth.     Turkeyfied Marine 1    <small>(Addressed as Sarge)</small>: Rodriguez, Fincher. Get eyes on that.     Turkeyfied Rick   : Huh. Turkey Marines. The President came to play. Jam those two radios.      Ship   : Confirmed.  (Radio static followed by Turkeyfied Rick kicking Rodriguez/Fincher off the truck.)     Turkeyfied Marine 1    <small>(Addressed as Sarge)</small>: Fincher, Rodriguez, come in!     Turkeyfied Rick   : Copy, copy, tango, all good. Just a couple of branches on the roof.     Turkeyfied Marine 1    <small>(Addressed as Sarge)</small>: Don t ever turn your radio off again.     Flesh Rick/Morty   : We will not/never surrender.     General   : Oh yeah? Bring in the David Blaine box.     Summer   : Damn, is that a David Blaine box?     Jerry   : I told you we should have just gone to my parents  house.     Beth   : No, you didn t.     Jerry   : Well, I didn t say it out loud, but it should be well known by now that I d always rather be there.     Flesh Rick   : Oh, God, oh no!     Flesh Morty   : Aw, geez, Rick!     General   : Sir, we ve got Rick and Morty inside the box!     The President   : Then that confirms it.     General   : Sir?     The President   : No David Blaine box can hold Rick Sanchez. Scan the turkey truck!     Marine   : Huh. That s weird. ID chips for Fincher and Rodriguez are glitching.      The President   : Sanchez... I ll deal with this bastard myself.     General   : Sir, don t be a cowboy. You can t get re-elected dead.     Scientist   : System is calibrated, sir. That pill contains a tracking chip that will identify --     The President   : I know, it ll be important later! Do it.  <br />""}]}}}"

It turns out to be a blue Gotron Ferret, one of five animatronic Voltron-like vehicles that Rick is obsessed with. While Morty tries to convince him to go to Boob World, Summer offers to help him take the Gotron back to Earth. As Morty watches them walk away, a voiceover not unlike one from a mafia movie sounds where he foreshadows dark times following the Gotron, until Summer cuts him off with her own voiceover, which Morty himself can hear.  Rick, Summer and Morty collect the other four Gotrons offscreen and propose to [[Beth Smith|Beth]] and [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] that they join them to stop an interdimensional monster. When Summer pushes them to accept, they all suit up and combine their Ferrets into a Gotron, a mechanical warrior that easily defeats the monster. Rick, overjoyed at the success of the fight, starts planning to get other Ricks the Ferrets they need to complete their collections. Morty tries to ground him, reminding him that Rick wanted to be calmed down if he got too obsessed, but Summer cuts him off.  Rick invites four other Ricks and their families to a barbecue, where he, the other Ricks, and his Summer discuss business. Their attempts at striking a deal angers a violent Rick named Hothead Rick, but Rick easily replaces him with another Rick after he leaves. The five Smith families combine their Gotrons to form a gigantic Gogotron, which easily dispatches all the monsters that cross over to their dimension. Summer continues to rise in the ranks, while Morty is treated like a common worker and Rick's obsession with the Ferrets leads him to abuse alcohol and other substances.  At a nightclub built to hide from enemies, Rick drunkenly announces his plans to build a Gogogotron, disgusting Morty. When he steps outside for some air, he is kidnapped by the original pilots of the Gotron Ferrets, five teenagers animated in an anime style, who the Ricks have been killing alternate versions of to get their Ferrets. They initially try to bribe him with Boob World currency in exchange for insider information about Rick's operation, but when he resists, he is forced to fight off an assassination attempt. When he makes it back to the nightclub, he finds Hothead Rick destroying it with his Ferret, killing a Rick and getting himself killed in the process. Summer has Morty thrown out of the operation.  Summer fires her parents from the operation on a whim, while Rick hires Kendra, one of the original Ferret pilots, and her friends. Rick fires Summer. At home, Morty has calmed down from the high of the operation, while Beth and Jerry are readjusting and attempting to do the same. Summer comes in and apologizes profusely for her behavior. She confesses that her attachment to the family working together comes from an experience she had had\u2014[[Naruto Smith|her giant baby]] from \""[[Rickdependence Spray]]\"" had been captured by the United States government and held on Mars. The government took Summer to him, hoping her influence as his biological mother could turn him into a weapon, but she bonded with him and helped him escape. As the Smiths try to figure out what to do next, Summer mentions Kendra and Morty realizes the pilots are planning to kill Rick and take their Ferrets back.  Inside the Gogogotron, the pilots have trapped Rick inside the head and are about to kill him when the Smiths, riding on the head of the gigantic baby, (who Summer has named \""Naruto\"") arrive. Naruto smashes the Gogogotron apart, killing all the pilots and rescuing Rick. Morty and Summer tell the audience in voiceover that life returned to normal after that, Rick lost his interest in Ferrets, and monsters continued to ravage worlds unstopped. As they continue to monologue, Rick pulls alien worms out of their ears and kills them, which he dubs as parasitic \""voiceovarians.\""  In a post-credits scene, a task force of bug monsters prepare to enter an interdimensional portal, so they can tell anyone they meet about the cure for AIDS. One cadet asks if the citizens of the other dimension will understand them, and the captain insists that going through the portal will not \""strip us of our clothes and make us screaming monsters.\"" As the cadets head through the portal, one comes out on the other side and tries to communicate the cure, but is shot as his presence is perceived as an attack.","<poem> ([[Rick]] is flying his ship with [[Morty]] and [[Summer]])    Rick, Morty, and Summer:    (singing) [[Boob World]]!

That s \""excited\"", \""stoked\"", and \""psyched\"".    Morty:    I didn t want you to come. Talk to Rick.    Rick:    Truth is, Summer, Boob World s been at the center of a few protests every day for 30 years, so they ve recently rebranded as a \""boob empowerment experience\"", and if we bring a female, we get in for free.    Summer:    So, I m like, what, a Coke can you re taking to Six Flags?    Morty:    No,  cause once you get into Six Flags, you can throw your Coke can away.    Rick:    No fuckin  way. It can t be.

Rick:    Let me finish.  2014 is more important  2014    Morty:    Yes!    Rick:    Let me finish!  2014 than having all five of the only five Gotron Ferrets in the universe?    Morty:    Are you finished? Yes! So let s go.    Rick:    Summer, help me hook the winch up to the ferret.    Summer:    Sure.    Morty:    What the hell? You said you were letting me choose.    Rick:    Yeah, whether to break my fucking heart. You chose badly. (walks away with Summer)    Morty voiceover:    That s how it all began. To my sister it was just another game. But what she didn t know  2014    Summer voiceover:    That was the moment everything changed.    Morty voiceover:    Wait, what?    Summer voiceover:    I had gotten my first taste of respect, and my first voiceover.    Morty voiceover:    I can hear you. Can you hear me?    Summer voiceover:    And I knew then and there, I wanted more of both.    Morty voiceover:    Hello? (Intro) (Rick, Morty, and Summer run into the Smiths  dining room wearing Gotron suits)    Rick:    [[Beth]], [[Jerry]], do something fun with us! A giant monster s attacking in the Nibblenug system. Your suits are in the bathroom.    Morty:    Mine smells skeleton-y.    Jerry:    I have a chiropractor appointment.    Beth:    What are you involving us in?    Morty:    Rick s been collecting Gotron Ferrets, and now that he has all five, he can combine them into  2014    Rick:    Morty, for Christ s sake, spoilers!    Summer:    Spoilers, Morty! We don t need to sell this to anyone, there s a giant monster attacking.    Beth:    In the Nibblenug system. Since when does this house care about alien lives, we don t even watch  British television.    Rick:    Told you. Let s just get [[Gene]] from next door and a homeless guy.    Summer:    No, hold on, fuck Gene, fuck the homeless. Your kids and their grandpa are asking you to do an activity with them, when did that stop being a parent s wettest dream?    Beth:    I guess around the time our family created a [[Naruto Smith|giant incest baby]] and the government launched it into space.    Summer:    Oh my god, we made a giant incest baby. Oh my god, you might be a clone. I exist because you guys failed to abort me. We get the family we get, not the one we want, and if you want to keep the one you got, get your asses into some anime spacesuits!    Jerry:    Fair enough.    Beth:    Okay. (Beth and Jerry go to change into their suits)    Rick:    Good work, Summer-camp.    Morty:    Yeah, I m \""excitoked\"" about this.    Rick:    Sure you are. Now.    Morty voiceover:    Something new was forming, and I was at the bottom of it.    Summer voiceover:    I let Morty have his voiceover, it s really all he had left.    Morty voiceover:    Okay, can you hear me, or not?    Summer voiceover:    You mean, can I, Summer, hear you? No, my voiceover can hear your voiceover.    Morty voiceover:    What s the difference?    Summer voiceover:    One would be telepathy, dumbass. (Beth and Jerry come back)    Beth:    Now what?    Rick:    Now we  2014    Rick, Morty, and Summer:    Go Team Gotron! (The Smiths are sucked into tubes and start zip lining through futuristic metallic tunnels)    Jerry:    Where are we zip lining through futuristic metallic tunnels to?    Rick:    Each robot ferret is on a different location on [[Earth]]. You re going to the center of a volcano.    Jerry:    Thank... you? (The Smiths land in vehicles and monorail to the locations, and then jump into space in their Gotron Ferrets)    Beth:    Okay, well, this isn t not fun.    Rick:    Regroup on me, I ll shoot a portal to Nibblenug.    Jerry:    Did I just monorail from my kitchen to Hawaii just to regroup in outer space above my kitchen?    Rick:    Uh, Summer?    Summer:    It s cool, Dad, shut up. (Rick shoots a portal onto an asteroid and they go to Nibblenug, where a giant bug monster is looming over a bridge)    Rick:    Everybody, attack one at a time.    Beth:    Is that the best way to  2014    Rick:    Tee up something awesome? Yes. Follow me. (The bug swats them away)    Rick:    Guys, we did our best, but there s only one hope. Activating linkdock, intermorphs, ratify, postatrinos, maximize. (The Gotron Ferrets merge into a Gotron)    Rick:    Holy shit, I can t believe this is working. Go, Go-Team! It s Gotron Time! (The Gotron shoots its guns and gets charged with energy)    Jerry:    Oh, my god. Hell, yes!    Summer:    This is amazing!    Rick:    Okay, now we can knock it around a little bit, but trust me, we re still building to something.    Beth:    How do we  2014    Rick:    Just hit buttons, we re too big to fail! (Jerry kicks the bug)    Beth:    Wooah! I kicked him, that was me, right? (Morty and Summer punch the bug, Jerry kicks it again, and Morty does an uppercut)    Morty:    Uppercut!    Jerry:    I can t believe I almost went to the chiropractor.    Rick:    I ve been waiting a long time for this. Form Luminous Energy Sword! (The Gotron forms a luminous energy sword)    Rick:    Got your ass, mamma-jamma! (The Gotron slices the bug in two)    Morty:    Oh, that was fantastic!    Jerry:    (???)    Summer:    (???) ...tits, Grandpa.    Beth:    Suck tits! (The Gotron lands in front of the [[Smith Residence]] and the Smiths disembark)    Beth:    I was a foot! I was a goddamn (???) foot!    Summer:    We were like, \""Bwaaah\""!    Jerry:     Member when the sword was like, \""Bwaaah\""?    Morty:    I feel so alive!    Morty voiceover:    These were the good times, when we felt like we could do anything. But anything is never quite everything, and pretty soon...    Rick:    Tch, that was nothing. Nothing compared to what I   can   do. There are infinite universes where I still don t have all five ferrets. Those versions of me would do anything to complete their collections.    Morty:    Okay, but Rick? Remember what you told me to remind you? Sometimes enough is...    Rick:    Sometimes enough is enough.    Summer:    Morty, what are you doing?    Morty:    He gets obsessed, Summer.    Summer:    When are you going to find your shame?    Morty:    I have more?    Summer:    Grandpa just gave everybody the high point of their lives, and before he did, every single one of you was trying to talk him out of it.    Rick:    Wait, yeah. What the fuck?    Summer:    Now he says we can go higher, and big surprise, it s time to drag him down again.    Beth:    Well, I vote.    Summer:    No voting, no debate, it s not a democracy, it s a Rick-public. You re in or you re out.    Beth:    Obviously, I m in, I never said I wasn t in.    Jerry:    Me, neither. Tell us what we re doin  next!    Rick:    I want to put together a cookout.    Jerry:    That s it? I was honestly prepared to blow someone.    Beth:    Jerry.    Jerry:    I said prepared, and someone. (Summer whispers to Rick, and he kisses his granddaughter)    Morty voiceover:    Rick invited five versions of our family from different universes, each with incomplete Gotrons. I didn t have anyone to talk to, since the other four Mortys had been to Boob World.    Morty 1:    Did you walk on the beach?    Morty 2:    The beach that s all boobs?    Morty 1:    No, the beach that s all sand. Yes, the boob one!    Morty voiceover:    Rick was in the garage with the heads of the five families. ...Ugh, and Summer.    Summer voiceover:    In that first sit-down, it was [[Big Fat Rick]]; [[Ricardo Montoya]]; [[Hothead Rick]], he got that name because he was prone to dramatic outbursts; and [[Little Ricky Wrap-it-up]], who was always great at the end of a meeting. At the head of it all: me, and Grandpa Rick.    Big Fat Rick:    Eh, don t get me wrong, C-137. We re happy for your good fortune, but we did not travel to your universe just to have it rubbed in our faces.    Rick:    C mon, Big Fat Rick, you know your face is too small to rub anything on.    Big Fat Rick:    My face is the same size as yours.    Rick:    Wow, huh. Hold on. (Rick uses a [[Wristwatches|wristwatch]] to compare them, confirming they are indeed the same size)    Rick:    I ll be damned. You re so fat, it s an optical illusion. Summer, give him the pitch.    Summer:    We re offering to help each of your families complete their full Gotrons.    Big Fat Rick:    Gabaloccia!    Ricardo Montoya:    (???) ...what?    Little Ricky:    Opa!    Summer:    In exchange for some concessions.    Ricardo Montoya:    Ever since I was a little boy in the slums I have dreamed of having a complete Gotron. But concessions? I hope you mean the kind from a counter. I hope she means ice cream!    Big Fat Rick:    Gabalo-guccia!    Little Ricky:    Opa!    Rick:    We d like you to move your families to this universe and let me make some modifications to the Gotrons, in the interest of us all working together.    Hothead Rick:    Wanna know what I think?    Rick:    Sure, Hothead Rick. Just don t unexpectedly fly off the handle.    Hothead Rick:    I think you guys got a lotta nerve actin  better than us! This is the family that made a giant incest baby! Had the government launch it into space! It s still floatin  around out there somewhere!    Rick:    Are we ever gonna live that down?    Hothead Rick:    When I get a full Gotron it won t be by kissin  your ass! It ll be by takin  what s mine! Yours! (spits on the ground)    Rick:    Hey, gross! No need. (Hothead Rick opens the garage and walks out)    Jerry:    And you were driving a ferret?     Hothead Rick:    We all are, moron! Gimme the key! (Hothead Rick s ferret blows up as Morty watches)    Hothead Rick:    You ll regret this, you level-headed fuck! (leaves through a portal)    Summer:    (closes the garage) Obviously, we predicted that might happen, which is why we have [[Yo-Yo Rick]] on standby. (Yo-Yo Rick enters the garage)    Rick:    Anybody got beef with Yo-Yo?    Ricardo Montoya:    Eh, I m okay. I m okay with that.    Big Fat Rick:    Good, that s good.    Rick:    Some people think he s lame, but to me, he s lame in a cool way, because he owns it. Cool. That concludes business. Little Ricky Wrap-it-up?    Little Ricky:    Raise  em up, boys! Opa! (Little Ricky presents five glasses and they do a toast)    Summer voiceover:    And so we helped our people find their ferrets. How they got  em, not our problem. (Ricardo Montoya and his family hijack ferrets from a team of anime people)    Summer voiceover:    Then we got down to business. Here s how it worked. If a giant monster attacked our planet, y all got the alert. (Montage)    Summer voiceover:    We formed five Gotrons. And those Gotrons formed the Gogotron. (Rick inserts a giant key)    Smith family:    Go, Gogotron! (Gogotron forms)    Rick:    I will never get sick of this!    Summer voiceover:    If you were a giant monster at that time in our universe, you never had a chance! (Montage) (The various Smiths are working at a Gotron factory)    Yo-Yo Rick:    Mine needs a weapon like a yo-yo. And a yo-yo on the chest. Are you listening to me? I need you to respect this partnership!    Summer voiceover:    I kept Rick removed from the ugly stuff. If you got in his way, I got you out of the way. (Summer is sitting with Yo-Yo Rick on a bed with a dead Jerry on it)    Summer voiceover:    And that made more room to move up.    Rick:    The head of my right arm. (Summer is given a Gotron key, and embraces him)    Morty voiceover:    Me, I ended up the left foot of the left foot, I guess because our robot didn t have an asshole.    Summer voiceover:    Well, it had one.    Morty:    Bitch! When are you going to stop breaking my balls? You win, okay?    Summer:    We re not competing, Morty. And there s your answer. I could move you up if I could trust you to put family first.    Morty:    How is that putting family first?    Rick:    Show me all the blueprints! Show me all the blueprints!    Summer:    I agree, that s an issue. Big Fat Rick, his flask stays full, or your locker gets emptied, thanks.    Morty:    I know it feels good when he likes you, but that doesn t mean him liking you makes you good.    Summer:    Solid babble, Morty, like a fortune cookie written by Borat.    Morty:    Yeah, I m not as smart as you, that s why I know you know what I mean.    Summer:    You mean if I really loved my family, I d give control of it back to your jealous ass? Green Ferret 4 needs a wash and we re out of detergent.    Morty:    I just bought a box.    Summer:    And Grandpa snorted it because you make him feel fenced in.    Rick:    Sum-sum! (points to nose and drinks)    Summer:    Get two boxes. (Commercial break)    Summer voiceover:    We evacuated one of the planets we saved and found a secret nightclub on it. A place no enemies could find us, unless you count my brother.    Morty voiceover:    I didn t even have my own ferret anymore. Summer made me somethin  called an \""Associate Security Chief\"", whatever the hell that means. (Little Ricky is conducting his family on the stage for a musical performance. Rick goes on stage with a microphone and interrupts it.)    Rick:    Look at this guy. Ha-ha. And look at this guy. Look at this guy over here! (grabs Little Ricky) Meow-meow-meow, meow, meow-meow! (Little Ricky and his family starts playing again as Rick gestures at his granddaughter)    Rick:    Oh, there she is, my baby princess, get up here. Stop the music! (Music stops and Rick gets the spotlight)    Rick:    This is our queef  2014 our queen. She saved my life, she set me free, we wouldn t have what we have without this crazy bitch. And she s got a special announcement. (lowers the mic to Summer) Summer, tell  em what we talked about.    Summer:    Now? I don t think  2014    Rick:    Okay, I ll do it, goddamn.    Morty voiceover:    The new job did have some perks, like I got to be around the night Summer realized she was in over her head.    Rick:    Yeah, okay. I ve got 90 extra ferrets, which means I need 10 more, and then 4 of you get your own Gogotron, and 20% of you get a Gotron,  cause we re all gonna have a fuckin  Gogogotron! (The audience cheers, and Rick collapses on stage)    Summer:    He s very excited. Um... (cues Little Ricky)    Little Ricky:    Opa! (raises his glass) (Morty walks out of the nightclub, with an anime guy in a yellow Gotron suit standing outside the door with a car)    Morty:    Oh, I hate my family. (The anime guy takes his gun out)    Anime Guy 1:    You should. Get in. (Morty and the anime guy get into the car)    Anime Guy 1:    How s it going with your grandpa s compulsiveness? Is your sister still enabling it,   huh  ?    Morty:    Who are you people?    Anime Guy 2:    Let s just say, we re the rightful owners of these ferrets.    Morty:    Then why were they scattered and buried across the universe?    [[Kendra]]:    We mean, in a more general, cultural sense,   ehh  !    Anime Guy 1:    What your grandpa did is called appropriation! Not cool,   heugh  !    Kendra:    Look, Morty. We ve been watching. We know you re the one that knows what s best. Work with us from the inside. Help us take over this operation. We re literally designed for it,   mm-hmm  ?    Anime Guy 2:    Nobody will know it was you, then you can get back to what s important. (opens suitcase)    Morty:    Are those Boob Bucks?    Kendra:    Legal tender at every kiosk and ride,   huh  ?    Morty:    I can t. Summer s treating me like shit, but, she s still my sister.    Anime Guy 1:    That s really noble, Morty. If you were in our family, your loyalty would be rewarded. But you re not in our family, which means we can kill you.    Morty:    Oh, yeah? (Morty grabs the gun, shoots a hole in the window, and crashes the car while falling out of it. Next, Morty is shown limping back over to the nightclub.)    Morty voiceover:    And sure enough, just when I stuck my neck out for the family, it got stomped on, anyway. (Summer comes out of the door, but they are suddenly knocked down by a stomping Gotron, and then they get back up)    Summer:    Rick!    Morty:    Mom! Dad! (The Gotron has only a head and a left leg, and is stomping on the nightclub, but is surrounded by Gotron ferrets. A red Gotron ferret breathes fire on the left leg, destroying the Gotron, and Hothead Rick is ejected out of the head.)    Hothead Rick:    Hothead Rick, baby! (Hothead Rick flips off the red Gotron ferret, but it breathes fire on him)    Hothead Rick:    Aaaugh! I set myself up for that! Aaugh!    Rick:    What the hell happened?    Summer:    Hothead Rick.    Beth:    How did he get so close to us?    Summer:    Morty was supposed to be security.    Rick:    Morty!    Morty:    I stepped away, all right? But not to let that happen!    Jerry:    Morty! We re not attractive strangers next to you on a flight to Paris traveling alone to get over a breakup, so this is no time to be coy!    Little Ricky:    Opa! (The family runs over to Little Ricky, who has been crushed under a piece of rubble)    Summer:    Little Ricky!    Little Ricky:    I m all wrapped up, Summer. Ohh... (Little Ricky dies, and Summer, Beth, and Jerry cry)    Morty:    Guys, I know you don t trust me, but what have we become? Why are we doing this anymore?    Jerry:    Because it s fun, you little rat! Now go home and play video games while we clean up these bodies, or your mother and I will hire people to break your knees! (Beth pulls out a big wad of bills and gives it to Morty)    Beth:    This is $16,000 we got from the Deep State for stepping on that trailer park. It should be enough for school, lunch, and home repairs. Now I gotta turn my back on you.    Morty:    No! (cries and drops the cash)    Summer voiceover:    With Morty out of the way, things were looking up. But looks aren t everything. (Back at the Gotron factory, the Gogogotron is being built)    New Jerry:    Hi, Summer. Umm, my cockpit s not getting Wi-Fi...    Summer:    Dad, you know that s not what I do around here.    New Jerry:    Oh, I m not your dad. I m a version of him, and this is my first day here, I m not sure what you do around here.    Summer:    Then, fuck off.    New Jerry:    Oh, fuck you.    Summer:    Excuse me? I want your ID. (The Jerry runs away, and Summer walks up to a working Beth)    Summer:    Mom. Are you Mom? Can you control your working Jerrys?    Working Beth:    Sweetie, we re all a little overwhelmed.    Summer:    Good point. You re not a war-time mom, why don t you find your version of Dad and take a break, take a holiday? (The Beth keeps working)    Summer:    I don t have time to wait for your confirmation, so let s just say, if you re here in 10 minutes, I ll have you removed. (Rick pins Gotron plans to the wall)    Rick:    And then the Gotrons make the Gotrons make the Gotrons make the Gotrons. (Rick sits down and drinks, then Summer walks in the door)    Summer:    Couple of snags, but I know how to speed things up. (Rick burps)    Summer:    Remember how we talked about how the best thing we could do for the family is recruit from outside the family?    Rick:    Yes, way ahead of you. Summer, I want you to meet Kendra. (Kendra closes the door)    Rick:    She s from a temp agency. She s got an entire workforce ready to go, and all of them have previous giant robot pilot experience. So, we ll be ready to go ahead of schedule.    Summer:    Well, I don t know about that, but...    Rick:    Well, Kendra knows, so.    Summer:    So... (Rick is frowning at Summer) (Morty is sitting on the couch sipping on a juice box when his parents walk in, upset)    Morty:    You re here to break my legs?    Jerry:    No, we re here to talk shit about your sister, because she just fired us.    Morty:    You re kidding.    Beth:    Arrogant little bitch. (Beth and Jerry sit down)    Jerry:    Should we clip her?    Beth:    No, she s not worth doing time.    Jerry:    You wouldn t do time. You brought her into the world.    Beth:    So I can take her out. You thought that was an actual lot (???)? It s a joke mothers say. What kind of fucked-up world have you been living in?    Jerry:    Uh, one where your mother murdering you isn t a comedic premise?    Morty:    Guys. There s a little adjustment period, but pretty soon you re gonna return to normal, and you re not gonna wanna kill Summer, you re not even gonna be mad at her.    Beth:    Nah, fuck her. She s my enemy.    Jerry:    Should we kill ourselves so we can get to hell before her and hide near the entrance?    Beth:    Hmm, I like that. (Summer walks in)    Summer:    Rick fired me. (Summer cries and her parents get up to hug her)    Jerry:    Aww, baby...    Beth:    Aww, sweetie...    Summer:    I m sorry.    Beth:    Are you okay, baby? What happened to us? We lost our minds.    Summer:    I did it. Morty was right. I got addicted to making Grandpa happy.    Beth:    It s only because your grandpa inflates the value of his happiness.    Jerry:    Eh, that s a good point. I mean, look at me, I m easy to make happy, which is why nobody gives a shit if I am.    Summer:    I appreciate it, but there s something else, too. I ve been really sensitive about family lately because of something I ve been keeping secret.    Beth:    Oh.    Jerry:    Okay, who s on the Supreme Court and what state do we live in, it s been years since I thought about this.    Summer:    No, I m not pregnant, but as you guys recall, and as a lot of people keep bringing up, Morty and I did accidentally create a giant incest baby, which the government did launch into space. And, I m not sure how to tell you this, but, it is still alive, and I have been in contact with it. (Flashback starts)    Summer:    There were soldiers waiting for me outside [[Harry Herpson High School|school]] last month, and they took me to the Pentagon and briefed me, and from there I was shuttled to a secret base on Mars. They had captured him and wanted to see if he d respond to me. instinctively, being his mother. And he sure did, but what they didn t expect was that I d respond to him. I was supposed to help discipline him so they could turn him into the ultimate weapon. Instead, I trained him to love, to believe in himself, and finally, to escape. (Flashback ends)    Summer:    The government doesn t want anyone to know it happened, but it s only a matter of time before the story comes out, and when it does, all we re going to have is each other, and you guys are a couple, and Rick has Morty, but I m the odd one out, so I wanted to make sure we stuck together. But instead I drove us apart and Rick replaced me with an anime girl, so all I got is myself and my giant tortured government-trained rogue incest monster baby out there in space somewhere.    Jerry:    Aww, baby. Holy fuck. And then you have to wonder, what else are they doing with our taxes?    Morty:    Wait, Summer, what did you just say?    Summer:    Morty, a lot.    Morty:    He replaced you with an anime girl? Big eyes, plus signs for teeth, ends sentences with weird sounds that don t fit?    Summer:    Yeah, and that s going to be his whole crew now, and they re about to run their first test on the Gogogotron.    Morty:    Those people wanna steal the robot. They re gonna kill Rick! He s all alone, we ve gotta go save him!    Summer:    Right. Or, you know, fuck him.    Jerry:    I m good with that.    Beth:    Yep. Fuck him.    Morty:    Guys! A great leader once told me, you get the family you get. (Summer smiles) (In space, the Gogogotron is forming)    Rick:    Right. It works. Now we just gotta find a giant monster.    Kendra:    My sensors have picked one up, Rick.    Rick:    Okay, okay. Lock onto its location.    Kendra:    Yeah, got it. Oh, it s you!    Rick:    Huh? (Kendra makes the Gogogotron punch itself in the face with its right arm)    Rick:    What the hell is this?    Kendra:    Thanks for making the biggest robot ever, Rick. We ll take it from here. Haha!    Rick:    You little assholes! (Rick overrides control of the left arm to hold down the right arm)    Anime Guy 1:    Ah! You son of a bitch! (The yellow-suited anime guy piloting the left arm takes back control and makes the robot punch itself in the face)    Rick:    No! (Kendra makes the right arm punch the head again and the Gogogotron goes flying back, knocking over Rick s seat)    Rick:    Deuugh!    Kendra:    Lock and load, boys. (Rick gets up and 5 anime people cut a hole in the door to his chamber)    Rick:    Say hello to my little me. (starts shooting at the anime people with a Rick-shaped laser gun)    Rick s gun:    Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang! (The yellow-suited anime guy gets hit by the 8th shot, and the others start firing back at him)    Anime Guy 1:    Deagh!    Rick s gun:    Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!    Rick:    Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!    Rick s gun:    Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang! (The laser battle knocks over a statue)    Rick:    Ha-ha-ha-ha!

When they leave, Rick goes to the [[The Garage|garage]] and activates \""Best Friend Rejuvenation Sequence,\"" which brings the cybernetic, half-dead [[Birdperson]] out of the wall Rick had stored him in in \""[[Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri]]\"". Rick removes his cybernetic parts and tries to bring him back to life, but Birdperson only wakes up for a second, sees Rick, and promptly falls unconscious again. Rick's Garage AI reports that Birdperson has hidden his conscious mind inside his unconscious mind. With no other choice, Rick enters Birdperson's mind to save him.  Rick arrives, nude, in the memory of their meeting at an alien music festival, using a bystander to point him towards Birdperson. He goes through a memory of a battle between Rick, Birdperson, and several [[The Citadel|Citadel of Rick]] agents, before landing in a memory of Rick, Birdperson, Squanchy, and several other Resistance fighters planning \""The Battle of Blood Ridge\"". Memory Rick notices him and Rick reveals to him that he is just a sentient memory, before incapacitating him and finishing a device that lets him track Birdperson through his mind.  He finds Birdperson observing a memory of him and [[Tammy Guterman|Tammy]] together. Birdperson rejects his rescue attempt and flies away just as [[Gromflomites|Gromflomite]] soldiers attack. Memory Rick joins Rick in the fight and the two win, going off to find Birdperson. In the garage, both Rick and Birdperson are having a seizure. The AI that control Rick's garage notices neighbor [[Gene]] walking by, and convinces him to bring it as many batteries and solar panels as possible.  The Ricks track down Birdperson to a large red crystalline tree. They split up, Memory Rick entering Birdperson's memories suppressed by the [[Galactic Federation|Federation]] after being transformed into Phoenixperson. Rick finds Birdperson making bombs out of rage, and, upon seeing Rick, he detonates them in an attempt to destroy his own mind. Memory Rick sees Birdperson's death as the tree begins to collapse, and the Ricks run, not before Rick stops at the memory of his fight with Birdperson in \""Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri\"", defeats Birdperson, and orders himself in the memory to give him his clothes. The destruction of the tree turns all of the [[Bird People]] nearby feral.  The Ricks go through the \""PTSD-Station\"" to get to Birdperson, and end up in the Battle of Blood Ridge. Memory Rick, eager to see it, is delighted to find that the Resistance easily wins the battle, mostly because of the efforts of Rick and Birdperson. As Rick looks for a way out, Memory Rick observes that after the battle, Rick offered to take Birdperson to whatever reality they wanted to go to and stop fighting, but Birdperson rejected it, stating that it was not worth his integrity.  Birdperson has taken a Memory Tammy to watch the sunrise with him at their home, and both are ambushed by the Ricks. As Rick argues with Birdperson to try and take him back, he reveals that both him and Memory Rick had learned that Birdperson and Tammy had a [[Birdperson's Daughter|child]]. Birdperson decides he will live for his child, held by the Federation, just as the memory Federation attacks. The four steal a Federation car and drive through Birdperson's memories.  Rick reminds Birdperson of a time when they used the mind erasing gun on Jerry and they travel to Rick's garage, where they retrieve the gun. Rick explains that to reach the exit, they need to use memories that Rick and Birdperson share mainly rooted in anger and sadness to \""lily pad\"" their way to a happier memory of their first meeting where they indulged in the use of the illicit Federation substance [[Senthol Diempathate]]. They travel through a funeral of a friend, Squanchy's attempt at stand-up comedy, and Rick, Birdperson, and Squanchy's band. As they arrive at a portal that will take them out, they are attacked by another Tammy, who Memory Rick throws into the abyss along with himself. A black, bird-like goo creature attacks, Birdperson says goodbye to Tammy, and Rick and Birdperson fly out of his mind.  After narrowly escaping the collapse of his brain's neural pathways and regaining consciousness, Birdperson confronts Rick over not telling him about his incarcerated child until it was \""necessary to save\"" himself. Disappointed, he leaves just as Gene arrives with his batteries. Panicking, the garage pretends to not know him and shuts the door. However, Rick is not angry and tells the garage that he understands.  Meanwhile, it is shown Memory Rick is still alive after transporting himself inside Rick's brain. Rick finds him and offers to make him real to get a drink, Memory Rick follows but hesitates realizing that doing so would mean he eventually becomes present Rick.  In a post-credits scene, Birdperson's daughter is picked on by an inmate in a Federation prison, and is seen attacking him before being dragged away.","Beth: No parties. There's wafer cookies in the cupboard and I left emergency numbers on the fridge. Yeah yeah. W-Wait, what? Emergency numbers on the fridge? What does that even mean? Honestly, I don't even know. I've seen so many movies that start with the parents leaving, it just popped out of my mouth. Are you sure you don't want to come with us? Nah, get... get outta here. I've got a million things I've been putting off. Are you sure, Rick? I know... I know a cruise doesn't sound like an adventure on paper, but, y'know, what does? ( Chuckles ) I-It's paper.

Grapflapian: Some of us still have Home Planets to protect. Bird Person: And some of us do not. We need to fight. The impassive is incapable of mercy. I've got a pitch, but we could also just devolve into yelling. ( All shouting ) ( Device warbling ) ( Weapon cocks ) If you know me... and it looks like you do... you know you're dead. I know why you haven't pulled the trigger. You're wondering why I'm old and naked. And you're about to wonder why all your memories before you met Bird Person feel very generic and bird-themed. Why was my 9th birthday party in a pine tree?! Don't take this badly... You're a memory of me assembled by our best friend's mind, and you're putting it together because he remembers you as smart. Smart enough to know that a memory can't do this. He remembers you shooting green holes, but not where they went. So, what's my deal? Am I sentient? D-Do I have free will? Who does? Who does?

For a sec, you kinda made me like myself. You'll grow out of it. Let me do this myself, okay? Is your ego really so fragile you won't take help from an invincible memory of yourself? Ow!

""This"" is where you being ""this"" leads. You're not my fault. I'm yours. You met me on my way to save a very old, very real friend after a lifetime of reality. I met you on your way to a fairy tale at Blood Ridge. Wait, you're saying Blood Ridge goes bad. We have a Vietnam? That's fսck¡ng cool! Why am I saving a friend that remembers me as this insufferable? BP, where the hell are you going? Probably there. Damn. Wow, he's really taken some drastic self inventory. What do you think is down there? If I had to guess, I'd say we're near the memories the Federation suppressed when they resurrected him as a cyborg. He might be here to unseal them. He was a Federation cyborg? That means there might be some juicy intel down there. Ah, good idea. Let's split up, and you go get it. What am I getting?

If you die in your friend's brain, you die in real life. We have until his neural pathways erode. Hold on. I need something first. ( Groans ) It's funny... I always wondered who would win if we ever fought. Then you were always a bad friend. Your life isn't real, and I didn't save it. Take off all your clothes. I knew this was how I'd die. ♪ ♪ Whoa, oh!

Ugh. That's the Battle of Blood Ridge. That's our Vietnam! Your values are wrong! This is the big show, gentlemen and lady! Thank you! We're dropping into Blood Ridge, one final chance to stop the Federation offensive. If we lose here... All aboard! Hey, don't mind us. You guys are all just a memory of war. Don't tell them that!

Bird Person: It was extremely bad ass. The Battle of Blood Ridge is over. The Federation lost. I am in your debt. Come with me. To somewhere... nearby? Anywhere. E-Everywhere. Rick, I don't expect you to keep fighting, but this war is... Far from over, I know. Dude, I share this with almost nobody, but... I could take you, right now, to this same battlefield, in a universe where we lost, or another where we won, or another where the war never even happened. All equally real, all equally unreal. None of it matters. Then why did you help? Because I respect you. And I wanted you to know you could respect me. Even though nothing matters? Okay. You matter... to me. Uh, the relationship that we have... I never used that word! ... is not worth my integrity... Oh, my God. It's not a complicated transaction, my man.

As he finishes his bucket list, he returns to the garage only to find that Rick had marked a notch on his container of portal fluid so he would know if Morty used the portal gun. Panicking, Morty mixes Mountain Dew with the remaining fluid, which the gun seems to accept. He accidentally spills the remaining portal fluid on his palm, which creates a small portal that regurgitates junk and shows him a man named [[Nick]], who tells Morty he has a portal on his thigh, referring to it as his \u201cstash hole.\u201d  Rick finds out that Morty tampered with the gun, and, furious, decides to have Morty replaced by a wheel of names, deciding on two crows. Nick, somehow familiar with Rick, cites their relationship as abusive and encourages Morty to embrace this change, while Rick easily catches and trains two crows. Morty tracks Nick down, finding him in a mental hospital. A sheepish Nick explains he met Rick at a bar and became too curious about his portal gun, leading Rick to shoot him out of a catapult and force a mental breakdown. Using their portals, Morty and Nick fight off the hospital's abusive staff and dub themselves \""The Portal Boys\"".  While on a mission, the crows try to save a group of tortured aliens over a valuable artifact, leading Rick to dump them on a planet of intelligent crow aliens. The aliens pull down his ship, offended at the notion of him abandoning their kind, and help Rick become more in tune with the crows. Nick and Morty break into the garage, where Nick helps Morty vent his rage against Rick by wrecking the place and taking an empty prototype portal gun. When Rick returns to Earth with the crow aliens and sees the trashed garage, they notice the wheel and realize Rick's crow training was all an elaborate joke. Furious, the aliens turn all nearby crows feral and take Rick's crows, with him pursuing.  Nick and Morty go to Rick's portal fluid supplier and things turn violent when Nick pulls a gun. He incapacitates Nick when he shoots unarmed civilians and flees. As Rick breaks onto the crow ship and is quickly captured by the aliens, he gets a call from Morty and answers. Morty apologizes for lying to him, and Rick admits the crows were just a bit. Hearing this, his crows allow themselves to be transformed into crow aliens by a large energy egg. His crows pretend to attack him, but actually reattach their laser wires and use it to kill the aliens and destroy the egg, which changes them back.  Morty is attacked by Nick, who runs his car off the road and corners him on a set of train tracks. He inadvertently reveals his story of Rick hurting him to be a lie, and Morty, realizing he has to disconnect their portals, severs his hand under a train wheel and drops it in Nick's thigh, creating a singularity that destroys him. Seeing Morty outside the house while flying down in a crow ship, Rick regrows his hand and rejects their partnership, declaring himself a bad partner and that Morty would be better off without him. Morty watches tearfully as Rick cleans out the garage and waves goodbye, leaving in a crow ship to start the \""Rick and Two Crows\"" show, which he announces to no one in a drunken ramble.  In a post-credits scene, an alien that eats Rick's trash which has been dubbed \""Garbage Goober\"" is confronted by his wife. She reminds him that his work is not what he signed up for and that he is a doctor and deserves respect. When Garbage Goober finally agrees to ask the family for dignity, [[Summer Smith|Summer]] offers him trash to eat, he eagerly leaves to go consume it.",""":"""",""query"":{""normalized"":[{""from"":""Forgetting_Sarick_Mortshall/Transcript"",""to"":""Forgetting Sarick Mortshall/Transcript""}],""pages"":{""-1"":{""ns"":0,""title"":""Forgetting Sarick Mortshall/Transcript"",""missing"":""""}}}
It came as a shock to many… But with the power vacuum left by the heartless consumption of our dictator, we shall impose even more Draconian cookie law, one be-cookieing at a time! Hah! Oh, thank you! They took power immediately after you and your grandpa left. Err sorry about that, Rick doesn’t really do ‘transition plans,’ I-I think he was just hungry. Well, now with you here, perhaps a new system of government? King Morty– Sorry, look I gotta run, I-I’m sure you guys’ll figure it out, I-I believe in you! Morty! Can you help us with this UFO-shaped hole? Sure, geez, but y’know only because I was in the neighborhood. [Screaming] Morty, thank God! The beast emerged right after your grandpa left and its gem went missing… Geez, that is a crazy coincidence that I-I if I were you, probably just best left alone. He’s right. We-We should celebrate. Feast? No time. S-S-Sounds pretty classic though, don’t let me hold you up! [Gasps] Son of a bitch. He marked it. Ah! Phew. Hah. What the… [Grunting] Hey, what the hell? Agh! Jesus! You got some of that green stuff on you too, huh? Th-Th-This is bad. Th-This is really bad. Hey, how do you think I feel? I had the ultimate stash hole and now I got a kid in my thigh. ♪♪ ♪♪ Look, you seem like a perfectly nice guy in my hand hole, but if I can’t sort this out I’m dead… What the hell, dude? Gross. I-I-I was just trying to… You’re just trying to what? Where’d this stuff come from? Garbage Goober, get out here and eat this garbage. Mmm, trash, I love trash, yum yum trash, I wanna eat trash… Hell yeah, I love that lil guy. Wait a minute. Is that Mountain Dew in my quantum transport solution? I-I saw you were marking the levels so I-I had to top it off. “Top it off?” Do you know how dangerously toxic this stuff is? And you added it to my portal fluid?! Only because you don’t trust me! Oh, that’s great logic, Morty… forgive me for not doing the kissy chef gesture since you probably spilled this [bleep] everywhere and I don’t want to teleport my lips. I did I did not spill it! I won’t take your word for that and I shouldn’t have to, which is why I have sidekick rules. If you can’t follow them… I can be replaced, yeah, yeah, so you keep telling me. Excuse me? Did you just try to call my bluff? Have you ever seen me bluff? Fine. You know what, replace me! Replace me, Rick! Just do it. Good luck finding someone that can be told 80 thousand times how replaceable they are! Okay. I’ll see your bluff call and raise you reality. I can’t pretend I haven’t been looking forward to this. Behold my Wheel of Better Things Than Morty. Wh-What are you eight? I-Is this macaroni art? You expect me to believe you built this because you don’t care? No, I built this because I don’t expect shit from you. Come on, anything! Anything but Morty, let’s go! Come on baby, no whammies! Duh-duh-duh-duh stop! Okay, that’s it. Two crows. You’re fired! You know what? Eat sh*t. You’re just trying to make me feel worthless. I never said you’re worthless. In fact, I’ve given you a very clear metric of your worth: Two crows. Note I didn’t say three! Man, that is not a healthy relationship. I hope you don’t mind me eavesdropping. Maybe we can figure out some sort of sound-proof bandage solution. Hey did Garbage Goober eat my porno magazines? So, were you like, a friend of Rick’s? Were you? Good question. W-What’s he doing, i-is he out there making sure you see him collecting two crows? And now you’re thinking, gee, maybe if he cares enough to hurt me this bad… dot dot dot. Break the cycle, Morty. Change the things that you can change. That’s what I did. And now I’m free. Only cramming six years into six minutes, fellas. Take your time! Now that’s what I’m talking about! If ya nail this next one, I’ve got bird quaaludes. And I might even share. Y-You know you can stop doing that for my benefit. Y’know or-or keep doing it. Doesn’t matter. I’m out. I’m walking away. Wait. Morty. Don’t go. Not until you see this! Commence bird on a wire! Yeeeeaaaahhhhh! [Groans loudly] Jerk. Hey, let’s hang out. We’re like brothers now, we both got away y’know, w-where are you at? Ooh, you know what, sh**t, can’t. I’m an alien, um, so… That’s okay, Rick turned my bike into a spaceship for “solo adventures” like picking up his Venusian foot ointment. God I’m seeing it so clearly now. [Switch clicks, whirring, warbling] Oh. Wait. I-It says here you’re on Earth. Yeah. Ah. Don’t come here. Why not? Look, I-I get it, my room is sometimes messy too, I’ll-I’ll pick you up right outside your… mental asylum. Busted. You literally said “I’m free.” I’m literally not free. Stop! That’s my blanket! How do you know Rick? Look I came to your place with him one night after the bar closed. I started messing around in your garage and I spilled that portal stuff on me and he… kind of launched me to Australia… like with this weirdly primitive catapult, but…but the amm*nit*on is an airtight carbon chamber, yeah, that-that… that’s how we lost our cable guy. Anyways, that kind of experience shakes you up. So, sorry I misled you, have a nice life. Nick. You got a visitor. Damn, what happened to you? The guards like to b*at us on Sundays. Still better than Mondays. Geez, what happens then? They lick our faces when we’re tied down. Plus it’s meat loaf day. Well… you’re leaving now, buddy. Whoa, whoa, whoa! I-I swiped ’em off the guard on my way in. I-I mean, sure, yeah, I could undo my lock, but then what? After the smartest guy in the world’s done with ya, it’s kinda hard to find a footing again. That’s why I need to get you out of here. We’re not the problem, he is. And if you can have a fresh start, then maybe I can too. It’s not like it’s a prison break. We’re just leaving, like, a hospital that wants to help you extra bad. Follow me! Hey get back here, you better open this door! I can fly! Keep running, Nick. The more you sweat, the saltier your cheeks. Lick this! Thanks, Morty. That dude’s got a tongue like a cat. Stop those Portal Boys! Did you hear that? That’s gonna stick! [Groans] Damn. Just like Jackie Chan! Hah! I guess that makes me Chris Tucker. I-I guess? [Shocks] [Groans] Gonna get you! [Growls] [Gags] [Moans] Holy sh*t! Did you see that? I mean you blinded a guy with puke! Oh, it was insane. Gimme dap. Am I doing it right? D-D-Did I give you a dap yet? Look at us. We got out. And not just from the asylum but from Rick. You get to say what an adventure is now. You still got that list? Dude, we can’t do that stuff without Rick’s tech. Then it’s time the Portal Boys get themselves a portal g*n. Remember your training, crows. The idol should be around that corner! [Vocalizing] [Crows caw] Do you guys just follow training when you feel like it? That’s not being trained, that’s being dicks. [Caws] Ah, now I see. The real treasure is empathy. And that’s worth way more than any knick-knack. You guys just earned yourselves another adventure! The adventure is, you’re fired. Sorry, guys, if I wanted another bleeding heart, I’d inject reanimator serum into an actual bleeding heart. Relax, this is an avian planet with 40 million species of bird, even one day of working under me will make you apex geniuses down there.

Nobody tractor beams me… Nobody descrambles my tractor beam scrambler to boot. Sorry for the tractor beaming, but did you lose these two crows? Oh, uh, yeah, no I-I dropped ’em off ’cause I-I can’t hold a candle to them. Y’know it s-seemed like a… the decent thing to do. Be your crows. Train yourself. Crows are then trained. I’m open to what you’re describing if it’s easier than wiping an unearned smirk off my grandson’s face. W-What do I do? Look at your crows. Be your crows. God I am so glad I’m a primate. Fine. Looking at my crows. We train ourselves to stop training. The trained are untrained, we are untrained. All training is complete. Because no training was needed. ♪♪ ♪♪ My God. I-I get it, now. We are gonna shove this crow shit down Morty’s throat! Nick, m-maybe this isn’t a good idea. L-Like what if he catches us? He could trap me in a Matrix again. Listen to yourself. We wouldn’t even be in this situation if the dude hadn’t f*cked us both over. Damn it. He must be showing the g*n off to his stupid crows… i-it’s not fair! It’s okay, we can still liberate all this other stuff. Let’s only grab what we need, though. Oh, no. Sh*t. That’s Rick’s can crusher! H-He spent three weeks perfecting that. Morty, buddy, you forget that we’re in this together. Besides, tell me that didn’t feel the slightest bit good. I mean yeah, but w-we can’t do that again. Why the hell not? Whoa! Haha! Here we go, bitch! Son, have you fallen in with a weird stranger and are now trashing your grandpa’s place? ‘Cause I’ll help! Dad? Psh, whatever, man. Ah. Yeah! Yeah! Now eat my ass, Rick! Suck it, Sanchez! Morty, is that what I think it is? I mean, it’s the equivalent of an iPhone 3, and it’s empty but it means the Portal Boys be portal-ing! [Robotic voice] Rick incoming. Oh, crap, we better skedaddle! [Babbling] Moooooorty. But what about my dad, he-he’s like a-a… puddle. You heard the garage, Rick’ll turn him back into a solid when he gets here! Sorry, Dad, gotta go be heroes. G-Gonna take your car, love you! That’s us down there with the poop brown roof. [Wah, wah, wah] What is that? Oh. Ha. That? T-That’s… nothing. But I see “Two Crows” written right here beside… Gene with donkey brains, half a Paul Giamatti, and… sentient shit. I guess the “joke” being that crows are stupid? I think it’s a little more nuanced than that. Right, because you just learned empathy from us 10 minutes ago but now we’re going to learn we don’t get your humor? F*cking horse shit. Yeah, there’s not a ton to “get,” genius, the “joke” is your grandson was so replaceable that “even” two crows could do it. Haha. It’s funny except it’s not. Right, well, to be honest, that is how I felt at the time. But I’ve-I’ve rounded a corner. I seriously have, you guys. Well, now it’s time to round the corner of death! Let the crow-volution begin. Aah! Aw, that sound. What have you done? Turned crows against dozens of humans in a 300 meter radius. Jerry: Heeeelllllp… pleaseee… Oh, now you beg for help? That wasn’t me. What do you mean? Dooooown here. Jerry, what the f*ck, why are you a puddle? You don’t deserve these! Haha. Genius. Caaatch you at a baaad time? Yeah, Jerry. They took my g*dd*mn crows! Not now, Garbage Goober! Get back in your hole! Hohoho, our first adventure! This definitely the place? Yeah, Rick’s been ripping these guys off for years, they’ll-they’ll be really… [Distant yell] …uh, grateful. Y’know, there… Let’s just get that fluid, bud. The Portal Boys are about to be in portal business! Here he is. This rat was skimming your crystal harvest and sending it to a spaceman named Rick Sanchez. Bastard! Screw Rick! Kick his dick! Yeah, right?! But me and Nick here, we-we put a stop to that. The people of Kuntak thank you. He’s a bad guy, right? Y-You’re gonna bring him to justice? Yeah, of course. Uh, okay, p-pleasure doing business! Not so fast, Morty. We’re not leaving until we get what we came for. Funny, I’m prepared to. So hey, look, wh-what we want is portal fluid. As our thanks. Portal fluid? You think I’d live in a lizard mine if I had portal fluid? Right, ok, or we could just k*ll you for it. He’s kidding. He’s… t-the Portal Boys only k*ll with kindness. And with g*n. Oh, no. Oh, no.

Tiny-handed little brat… You think you can f*ck with me and get away with it?! [Tires squealing] Then you don’t know Nick. Busted. You don’t get it, do you? As long as we have these portals, you can never escape me. What the hell, man. I-I thought we were both victims of Rick’s abuse. Maybe we are, maybe we’re not. Maybe we both just drink at the same bar and maybe one night I tried to take his portal g*n. See I thought Rick was my ticket to something special, but it turns out you were, Morty. And look at me now… I’m a Portal Boy. That name sucks! I was just trying to yes-and! You don’t get it, Morty. We’re partners. Now fall in line or I’ll make your life a living hell. No… thank… you.

After defeating some in combat, [[Morty Smith|Morty]] approaches him, desperate to get back together. Rick rebuffs him awkwardly. Some time later, Rick is approached at a bar by a now middle-aged Morty, claiming Rick has been gone so long that [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] has died of cancer and [[Summer Smith|Summer]] has gotten married to a junkie. He begs Rick to come home, but Rick again rebuffs him.  The crows sneak out at night to plan adventures with Crowscare, Rick's nemesis. Realizing the crows were using him to get over a breakup the same way he used them, Rick returns home, only to find Morty was lying and he took aging serum from the [[The Citadel|Citadel of Ricks]] to emotionally blackmail him. After Morty gets properly re-aged, he notices a deformed Morty raving about the Citadel being an inescapable weapon of mass destruction, before he is shot by the police. [[President Morty]] invites the two to have dinner with him, with Rick expressing doubt and planning to leave if things go awry.  Over dinner, President Morty hints that Rick built the Citadel and requests information from Rick on how to \""bring down the [[Central Finite Curve]].\"" When Rick refuses, President Morty reveals he kept [[Evil Rick Sanchez|Evil Rick]]'s partial scan of Rick's brain from \""[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]\"", having completed it as Rick had been sitting at the table, and states he has enough to do what he needs. When Morty apologizes to Rick for bringing him to the Citadel, President Morty, disgusted, uses the brain scanning device to show Morty visions of Rick, as leader of the Citadel, previously having had Mortys tortured, used as labor, and having their parents' lives tampered with specifically to create more Mortys. He allows the two to leave, but Rick realizes his portal gun has been hacked (with internal coordinates locked to the [[Blender Dimension]]) after shoving a Rick guard into it and seeing the result. Rick C-137 then recognizes President Morty as an \""evil\"" variant he had previously personally encountered, the only person to have ever hacked his portal gun.  The Citadel's portals go haywire, killing anyone who tries to step into them, despite broadcast warnings instructing them not to. Rick and Morty go underground to try and find untapped portal fluid, seeing more deformed Mortys being used as slave labor. When Morty presses Rick on his involvement with the Citadel, Rick gives him the brain scanner and Morty uses it to see Rick's backstory.  After [[Beth Smith|Beth]] and [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]]'s murder at the hands of [[Rick Prime|another Rick]], (first shown in \""[[The Rickshank Rickdemption|The Rickshank Redemption]]\"") Rick C-137 perfects his [[Portal Technology|portal technology]] and uses it to explore dimensions and do research. He begins selling weapons and murdering those who cross him, later meeting [[Birdperson]] and joining the fight in the resistance before immediately going their separate ways after the Battle of Blood Ridge. He sets his sights on killing the Rick who murdered his family, massacring hundreds of versions of himself to find his target. A large number of Ricks of the multiverse hold a conference to decide how to stop Rick, who decides to crash the meeting, kill the speaker, and jadedly slaughter a large number of the audience with explosives. After Rick eventually tires of it, the survivors assemble into the [[Council of Ricks]] and, with Rick's assistance, built the Citadel. Upon finishing, he crash-lands on [[Cronenberged dimension|a version of Earth]] where [[Beth Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Beth]] is still alive and takes up residence there, taking Morty as his sidekick.  The two reach the Citadel's Dimensional Drive, where Evil Morty explains the Central Finite Curve is a multidimensional wall that separates all the infinite universes where Rick ''isn't'' the smartest man alive from all the infinite universes where he ''is'' the smartest man alive. Evil Morty intends to break through it so he can live away from Rick entirely. He claims that what makes him \""evil\"" is hating Rick and wanting to leave, and if any Morty has ever felt the same, then they are \""evil\"" as well. Doubtful, Morty asks Rick if he came back to him because he got over the crows, or because they got over him: Rick is unable to answer. At the same time, Evil Morty switches on the machine, which is powered by the blood of hundreds of [[Operation Phoenix]] clones, all rerouted to the Citadel.  Seeing Rick's deception once again, Evil Morty offers Morty a chance to come with him. Rick himself acknowledges that it is a better deal than staying with him, but Morty rejects this and opts to stay with his grandfather. The portal gun empty, the two escape the Citadel by detaching part of it and flying away, loading it up with Mortys and activating the booster together just as Evil Morty uses his machine to tear open the Curve and launch himself through it in a small spaceship. Coming out on the other side, he sees the rest of the [[multiverse]] and smiles while he activates a hologram from his wrist that shows all of the universes that make up the Central Finite Curve popping and disappearing. Finally, he opens a gold portal with an improved gun and steps through it.  In a post-credits scene, [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] talks to the audience about the end of the \""Evil Morty\"" arc and the collapse of his relationship with his wife after Rick caused him to lose his job in \""[[One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty]]\"", hypothesising about becoming \""Evil\"" himself (shown in \""[[Never Ricking Morty]]\""). As he makes dinner in a tiny apartment, he urges the audience to give love back to those who love them."," [Open Ext.

Morty:    Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood, i-it wasn 2019t like 2014     Rick:    It 2019s just that the battle for crows is kinda never-ending.     Morty:    Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That 2026 came out wrong. S-sounded judgey.     Crow-horse:    Crow-horse. Crow-horse. Crow-horse.     Two crows:    Caw, caw, caw.     Morty:    Okay. It looks like 2014 it looks like they 2019re leading you to a thing.     Rick:    Take care, Morty.     Morty:    You-you too. U-uh I 2019m doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him 2014  [ANIME OPENING]    Kaze ni nori tobitachi   (I 2019m riding on the winds)    Kuroi tsubasa hiroge   (We are soaring with our black wings)    Itsumademo issho ni tatakau   (Forever we will fight together)    Soranohate made   (Beyond the sky)    Kimi to   (With you)  [TITLE CARD:  RICK AND TWO CROWS ]  [Ext. Field, afternoon]  (Rick rides Crow-horse across a yellow field.)  [Trans. Tavern, night]  (Rick approaches the tavern.)  [Trans. Int. Tavern]  (Rick enters the tavern and is met with unfriendly stares.)     Rick:    Ahem. I 2019m lookin 2019 for [[Crowscare]]. The scarecrow. The evil scarecrow. Come on, whoever gives him up first lives.  (Someone coughs. None of the tavern patrons speak.)     Rick:    Fine, I can kill an extra asshole. Helps me get my steps in.  (A weapon sails at Rick 2019s head. He ducks and it flies through the air, decapitating several patrons. The weapon returns to the hands of a [[Pussifer|tiger man]].)  [NAME CARD: PUSSIFER]  (Rick and Pussifer fight. Rick ends up pinned down on the floor.)     Morty:    Rick!     Rick:    Morty?  (Rick disappears in a puff of smoke and a log is left in his place.)     Pussifer:    Wood?!  (Rick appears behind Pussifer and stabs him through with his sword.)     Pussifer:    Gahhh!     Rick:    Uh, Morty. Why are you now like forty?     Morty:    Th-that 2019s how long it 2019s been, Rick.  (Rick and Morty sit down at a table together.)     Rick:    Oh. Um, I guess we can have a drink together then.  (A waiter comes over with two beers.)     Morty:    Do you have a rum and coke?     Waiter:    What are you, twenty?     Morty:    Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart.     Rick:    Time be going by, don 2019t she?     Morty:    That 2019s your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life?     Rick:    I feel okay.     Morty:    Well-well, what about me?     Rick:    Woah. Excuse us boys, you don 2019t wanna be here for this.     Two crows:    Caw.  (The two crows fly off of Rick 2019s shoulders.)     Morty:    I thought if I gave you enough space, you 2019d outgrow this phase.  (The waiter returns with Morty s rum and coke.)     Waiter:    Here 2019s your drink, poser.     Morty:    [[Jerry Smith|Dad]] got sick, you know. Stage four. Heh, you woulda loved it. [[Summer]] 2019s a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time.     Rick:    Morty, what we had wasn 2019t healthy.     Morty:    And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their Big Bad?     Rick:    First off, the will-they kill-they is everything to my guys. And second, fuck you for trying to undermine my happiness.     Morty:    This may be the last time you lay eyes on me!  (Rick stands up and heads for the door.)     Rick:    I hope that 2019s not true, Morty. Because you look like sh-urrp-shit, and this is not how I wanna remember you.  [Ext. Giant Treehouse]  (Crow-horse sits on a branch outside the treehouse.)  [Trans. Int. Bedroom]  (Rick and the two crows are asleep in a nest bed. The two crows get up and fly out the window. Rick, facing away from the window, has his eyes open.)  [Ext. Crowscare 2019s Lair]  (Rick approaches the lair on foot. He hears a voice coming from inside.)     Crowscare:    Now that I have his two crows, nothing will stop me from eliminating Crow Rick!     Two crows:    Caw, caw, caw.     Crowscare:    Don 2019t defend him to me, I don 2019t even get what you see in him.     Two crows:    Caw, caw.     Crowscare:    You 2019re right, we should be enjoying the time we have together.  (Rick kicks down the door.)     Crowscare:    Crow Rick!     Two crows:    Caw.  (Crowscare lifts up a map as though he 2019s pulling up sheets to cover his chest.)     Crowscare:    Oh, I know what this must look like but 2014      Rick:    Looks like my arch-nemesis Crowscare and my sidekicks planning adventures together.     Crowscare:    You are hardly the victim here. I was adventuring with these two crows before you ever came along.  (Rick looks around the room. There are photos of Crowscare and the two crows on the wall. The bathroom door is open and he sees three toothbrushes.)  [NAME CARD: 3 TOOTHBRUSHES]     Two crows:    Caw, caw, caw.     Rick:    What do you mean,  2018using me as a rebound 2019?     Two crows:    Caw.     Rick:    You feel like I was using you as a rebound too? Well shit, this lost all meaning. Guess it could 2019ve been worse. At least  2018adventuring 2019 was just a metaphor for romantic partnership so it 2019s not a real breakup.     Crowscare:    Speak for yourself. We immensely enjoy each other 2019s bodies.     Rick:    What?! Eugh, no!     Crowscare:    Sounds like the man 2019s asking for proof! Let 2019s show him, fellas!     Two crows:    Caw, caw, caw.     Crowscare:    Ah, aah.     Rick:    I-I asked for zero proof! Zero proof!  [Trans. Ext. Smith House, day]  (Rick lands in front of the house on Crow-horse 2019s back.)     Rick:    I 2019m giving you free will. Yah!  (Rick opens a panel in Crow-horse s hip. He presses a button, closes the panel, and slaps Crow-horse 2019s hindquarters. Crow-horse runs off screen.)     Crow-horse:    Submit to Crow-horse!  (People scream off-screen.)     Rick:    Whoops.  (Rick rings the doorbell. Morty opens the door.)     Morty:    R-rick?     Rick:    Wubba lubba dub dub! I 2019m back, pal!     Jerry:    Morty, who 2019s at the door?     Rick:    Wait a minute, I thought you died gruesomely. W-what the hell 2019s going on here?     Morty:    See, um th-the thing is, uh 2014     [[Beth Smith|Beth]]:    Can you please make Morty fourteen again, dad? This is ridiculous.     Morty:    Okay, look, I-I may have used an aging serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little.     Rick:    I kinda figured and I totally get it, Morty. I-I 2019m done with the two crows, like they were super clingy and I 2019m ready to make this work.     Morty:    Let 2019s just hit the reset button.     Beth:    Well no, honey, not a reset, okay? Tell your grandpa that you 2019re worthy of his respect and you wanna be treated differently from now on.     Morty:    I refuse to do that, I 2019m desperate to get back together.     Jerry:    Just like his old man.     Rick:    Don 2019t worry honey, that 2019s just Morty 2019s middle age talking. He 2019ll be less codependent once we get more of his life in front of him again.     Summer:    Uh, I 2019d like him to stay forty so he can keep buying my friends molly. I 2019d rather throw my vote away than use it to support a flawed system.     Morty:    Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care.     Rick:    Okay buddy, who sold you this shitty aging serum? What did he look like?     Morty:    Just like you. I-I got it from [[The Citadel|the Citadel]].     Rick:    Hot damn! Hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode. See you later, masturbators.  [Ext. Citadel Plaza]  (A portal appears and Rick and Morty step through.)     Andy:    Hi! I 2019m the Citadel 2019s new mascot, Andy! Because this place wouldn 2019t be home without Ricks aaand-ey Mortys!     Morty:    Dumb.     Rick:    Oof, what happened to this place?     Morty:    There 2019s a [[President Morty|Morty president]] now.     Rick:    Ah, that 2019s cute. They rebuilt, and made it nicer.     Morty:    They made it Glendale.     Rick:    Goddamn you are cantankerous.     Morty:    Even pooping hurts now.     Rick:    Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up.  (They arrive in front of the Re-Build-a-Morty.)  [Int. Re-Build-a-Morty]  (Morty is inside a glass pod. Rick and an employee Morty stand in front of it.)     Employee Morty:    Okay, so 2026 we 2019ve got a standard Morty that 2019s been aged to forty.     Rick:    Can you reverse it?     Employee Morty:    Well if you look at it like a bone, what we can do is break his age in two places, remove the middle and graft its ends back together.     Morty:    Th-th-that sounds really violent.     Rick:    It 2019s not a literal bone, Morty.     Morty:    Oh, Okay.     Employee Morty:    Brace yourself, the process does also break every bone in your body.     Morty:    Wait, ahhhh! Ooh, ow!  (Morty is split into thirds and two of them become toddler Mortys.)     Toddler Morty 1:    I like crayons.     Toddler Morty 2:    Girls are gross.  (The two toddler Mortys are pressed together into a fourteen year old Morty. Morty steps out of the pod.)     Morty:    I-I-I think I feel like myself again.     Rick:    Eh, you look a little weird. Your skin 2019s all pink like a baby mouse. Is that normal?     Employee Morty:    Probably. Uh, sign here for storage or disposal of the twenty-six years we removed.     Rick:    Wait, what? I ain 2019t payin 2019 to store twenty-six years.     Employee Morty:    Well, then you 2019re taking it with you.  (A twenty-six year old Morty steps out of the pod.)     Twenty-Six Year Old Morty:    I 2019m almost ready to sell out.     Rick:    Alright, what 2019s disposal cost?  (Outside, a deformed Morty is being beaten up by a pair of police Mortys.)     Twenty-Six Year Old Morty:    S-something unfair 2019s happening!  (Twenty-six year old Morty runs outside.)  [Ext. Re-Build-a-Morty]  (A deformed Morty is wrestling a police Morty for his gun.)     Deformed Morty:    There 2019s no escape! No escape!     Twenty-Six Year Old Morty:    Let me help you, this is not a good look!  (Twenty-six year old Morty tackles the deformed Morty and one of the police Mortys to the ground. The other police Morty shoots.)  [Int. Re-Build-a-Morty]  (Rick and Morty are watching the events unfold outside.)     Rick:    Oh boy.     Morty:    Hey, they shot me!  [Ext. Re-Build-a-Morty]  (Deformed Morty has successfully taken the gun from one of the police Mortys, and is pointing the gun at the second police Morty. Twenty-six year old Morty is lying on the ground with a gunshot wound. Morty holds his twenty-six year old self.)     Police Morty:    You are seriously hurting the Citadel experience!     Deformed Morty:    Listen to me!     Police Morty:    Drop the gun!     Deformed Morty:    Death is coming for us all, and the Citadel is a weapon of mass destruc 2014  (Deformed Morty is shot through the head. Rick exits the Re-Build-a-Morty.)     Rick:    Woof. You 2019re about to get suspended with pay. Come on, Morty. Let 2019s get out of here before this gets political.     Twenty-Six Year Old Morty:    U-uh. Was I influential?     Morty:    Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven 2014 seven blogs.     Twenty-Six Year Old Morty:    Tight. Uh.  (Twenty-six year old Morty dies. A Secret Service car arrives.)     Rick:    Ugh. Too late.     Secret Service Rick:    C-137. President Morty requests you join him for dinner.     Morty:    Woah! S-seriously?     Rick:    You know I destroyed this place?     Secret Service Rick:    You 2019ve been pardoned for that, sir.     Morty:    Rick, let 2019s have dinner with the Morty president.     Rick:    Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on canon.     Morty:    Okay. I guess things really are going right back to how they were.     Rick:    Fine, I could eat. But the second he reveals he 2019s evil, we 2019re gone.  [Int. President Mort 2019s Dining Room]  (Rick and Morty sit across from each other at a dining table. The seat at the head is empty. Morty tests Rick 2019s food.)     Morty:    I don 2019t know. Tastes pretty good.  (Rick takes his plate of food.)     Rick:    Okay, let me know if you start feeling poisony. Good to have you back, buddy.  (Morty slides his own plate onto his placemat. The door opens and President Morty enters.)     President Morty:    Sorry I 2019m late. Never really ends around here.     Rick:    Look at this Morty. They really did make a you the president.     President Morty:    And I hate  2018em every day for it. But wow, Rick C-137. Now that 2019s a guy to move your schedule around for. Not-not here to blow the place up again, I hope. Ha ha.     Rick:    Ha. Not unless you try to keep me here.     President Morty:    Geez, wouldn 2019t dream of it. But it 2019s amazing you dropped by because I was eventually gonna hunt you down.     Rick:    There 2019s the reveal. Let 2019s dance.  (Rick takes out his gun and points it at President Morty.)     President Morty:    Ha, geez.     Morty:    Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Mortys. He 2019s being really nice.     Rick:    All politicians are nice.  (Rick puts away his gun.)     President Morty:    He 2019s a hot bag of peanuts, isn 2019t he?     Morty:    We 2019ve been through a lot, a-and he does not like 2014     Rick:    Serialized drama.     President Morty:    Right, no drama. Keep it episodic. Ricks never look back. Waste of a legend in his case. You know, he practically built this place.     Morty:    Wait, what?     Rick:    And now you re running it squeaky clean, right? That 2019s why you got deformed Mortys comin 2019 up through the sewer lines talking about  2018hope 2019 and  2018change 2019.     President Morty:    Fair enough.     Morty:    Good clap-back, Rick. What 2019s the deal with that, Mr. P?     President Morty:    I got a little project going on, acquired some hands-on labor. It would require less if you were willing to tell me how one might bring down the [[Central Finite Curve]].     Rick:    Alright, time to go Morty.     Morty:    I wanna know what he 2019s talking about.     President Morty:    Yeah, you 2019ve come all this way. Can you give me ten more seconds?     Rick:    Literally ten? Because now it would be six.     President Morty:    Oh, I 2019m fine with that. Make it two 2026 one. Like I said, would 2019ve been a big help for you to tell me, but I should have everything I need from you now. Let me just make sure 2026  (Morty checks the brain-scanning device.)     Rick:    You can 2019t scan an entire brain over appetizers.     President Morty:    Oh, most of yours got scanned a looong time ago.  (Restraints come out of the chairs, holding Rick and Mort in place.)     President Morty:    You probably don 2019t remember.  (The scene freezes, and Rick Stan Lee pops up at the bottom of the screen.)     Rick Stan Lee:    Check out season one, episode nine, Rickheads. Excel-uurp-cior!  (Rick Stan Lee disappears and the scene resumes.)     Rick:    Evil Rick.     Morty:    We kicked his ass.     President Morty:    Evil Rick. I love it. Smartest man in the universe, with an ego so big you could just grab it like a joystick.  (The brain-scanner stops projecting Rick 2019s memories.)     President Morty:    Looks complete. I was afraid I 2019d have to kill every Rick on the Citadel to get what I needed.     Morty:    You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I 2019m sorry, Rick.     Rick:    That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth one screwdriver.     President Morty:    Pfft, you sell-out Mortys kill me. I 2019d hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can 2019t help it; you were bred for it. Wanna see?  (President Morty sticks the brain-scanner into Morty 2019s neck.)     President Morty:    You already know rogue Ricks used Mortys to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty market. And I 2019m sure you don 2019t know how far they 2019ve gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally-occurring grandsons, but why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need. There are infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He 2019s an infinite smear of one shitty old man, and he 2019s attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. This is why we 2019re with him. This is why we 2019re alive.  (Morty sees a montage of Mortys being used as a cloaking shield, Citadel labs, Citadel Ricks pairing up Jerrys and Beths, Mortys going through assembly lines, and Mortys getting paired with Ricks.)     Morty:    What the fuck?! Rick, say this isn 2019t true!     Rick:    It isn 2019t the whole truth.     Morty:    Liar!     President Morty:    Liar.     Rick:    It 2019s complicated!     Morty:    I 2019m not busy!     Rick:    Okay, Morty, remember when all I said I needed was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doi, I 2019m basically Inspector Gadget.  (Rick frees himself from the chair 2019s restraints. He draws his gun and shoots at President Rick as he jumps over the table to Morty. President Morty is unimpressed, as the shot bounces off a forcefield.)     President Morty:    Uh oh.  (Rick frees Morty from his restraints. The Rick Guards at the door aim their guns at Rick.)     President Morty:    It 2019s okay, he 2019s free to go. He 2019s the Rickest Rick. We 2019ll never see him again.  (Rick opens a portal, then stops when he notices President Morty 2019s smug face.)     Rick:    Morty, when you came here for that serum did you refill this gun?     Morty:    Yeah.  (Rick grabs one of the guards and shoves him into the portal. The portal sends the guard to the [[Blender Dimension]].)     Morty:    Holy shit!     Rick:    I only know one man that ever hacked my [[Portal Gun]], and it turned out it was evil you.     President Morty:    Yay. He 2019s all caught up.  (President Morty pushes a button on a remote control and four elite Rick Guards drop down from the ceiling.)     Rick:    Wait! Hold it, hold it!  (Rick uses some of his blood and a vial of purple liquid to create [[Big Boy]].)     Morty:    Wh-who 2019s that?     Rick:    Time for Big Boy. Duck!  (The guards attack Rick, but all the damage is redirected from Rick to Big Boy.)     Morty:    Does he like it?     Rick:    He 2019s a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?  (Rick uses the stored energy from being attacked to take out the Rick Guards and break down the door. Rick reaches his arm across the room and grabs the brain-scanning device from the table.)     Rick:    Yoink!     President Morty:    You can 2019t outrun your past, Rick.  (Rick turns and shoots President Morty. It is blocked by the forcefield.)     President Morty:    Tch, did you think my forcefield would be down the second time?     Rick:    I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue!  (Rick and Morty exit the room.)     President Morty:    Ahaha. Disapprove all you want. Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering. Tonight, I do that thing I wanna do, with the Curve thing.  [Ext. Citadel plaza]     Loudspeaker system:    Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay.  (Ricks and Mortys try using their Portal Guns, only to find that their portals have been rerouted to deadly dimensions.)  [Int. Citadel News Room]     Rick D716:    In uncertain times like these, I think it 2019s important for me to say: Eat shit, fuck you! The drug companies paid for me to say every word, I have millions of dollars, and I don 2019t care 2014 oh god oh fuck no, oh 2014  (Tentacles come out of the portal D716 opened up and pull him in. Rick D716-B enters the room and sits down at the anchor news desk.)     Rick D716-B:   And I 2019d just like to say that prescription drugs are great and you should buy them now.  [Ext. Citadel]  (Rick and Morty run out of the building as fires blaze around them and portals kill other Ricks and Mortys.)     Morty:    What 2019s happening, Rick?     Rick:    He hacked the entire city 2019s portal supply. Come on, there still might be one way out of here. Out the bottom.  (Rick puts on a visor and picks up Morty. Using the visor, he cuts a circle in the ground around his feet. The two of them drop into the sewers.)  [Ext. Citadel]  (All across the Citadel, fires are burning.)  [Int. Citadel Sewers]  (Rick and Morty drop down. Rick removes the visor.)     Morty:    What do you think he needed from your brain?     Rick:    I assume schematics for the Citadel 2019s [[Dimensional Drive]]. If he 2019s gonna use it to blow the Curve, we do not wanna be here.     Morty:    What is the Central Finite Curve?     Rick:    Q and A after our survival. Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source and get the fuck outta here.  (They reach tubes of portal gun fluid, which drain before their eyes.)     Rick:    Or not.  (All the tubes in the cavern drain into a single pool as Rick and Morty go down a set of stairs.)     Rick:    Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.  (Deformed Mortys are performing labor while being whipped by a uniformed Rick.)     Morty:    So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything?     Rick:    Can 2019t you just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We 2019re back to simple adventures.     Morty:    It 2019s not a new leaf until you tell me everything.     Rick:    Morty, we really don 2019t have time for this. The whole place is gonna blow.     Morty:    No, I-I don 2019t trust you. I-I-I don 2019t wanna do this anymore if I 2019m not gonna get straight answers from you.     Rick:    Goddammit. Here 2019s my fucking downloaded brain, Morty. You wanna jump the shark? You wanna know my stupid crybaby backstory? Knock yourself out.  (Rick holds out the brain-scanning device. Morty grabs it and immediately sticks it into his neck.)     Rick:    No-not now!  [MEMORY FLASHBACKS]  (Past Rick is in his garage, talking to a Rick with a Portal Gun. The Rick leaves.  Past Rick is in his car. A bomb drops out of a portal and kills [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]] and [[Beth Smith|Beth]].  A paramedic examines Past Rick, who is wrapped in a shock blanket.  Past Rick sits in a run-down apartment. His hair is disheveled, he has a stained tank top on and he 2019s unshaved.  Past Rick creates a prototype Portal Gun. He embarks on a journey into the cosmos.  Past Rick lays on a blanket on a pizza planet. His signature spaceship is now with him. He runs from behind a slice of pizza and scans a telephone man with a handheld device.  Past Rick sits in an arctic environment, taking readings on a scanner.  The [[Story Train]] flies by.  Past Rick is given an arms dealer 2019s card. He delivers weapons to a group of aliens. They hand him a crystal. When he heads for the exit, the aliens aim guns at his back, but he presses a button on a remote and blows them up. In his ship, Past Rick uses the crystal to complete a helmet that allows him to print out an image from his memory: the Rick who killed Diane and Beth.  Past Rick shows the photo to a man living in a rundown town. The man shakes his head.  Past Rick, now with longer hair and a gun, eats at a bar with [[Birdperson]]. They rise from their seats and head outside. Past Rick and Birdperson fight bugs of the Galactic Federation in the streets.  Past Rick secretly visits the garage of a different Rick. He checks the map on the workbench and records the star cluster circled on it. He travels there and kills three Ricks, comparing the one inside the building to the photo of the Rick he 2019s hunting. It isn 2019t a match. On the wall, there is a banner with a symbol on it; photos of other Ricks are connected to it by red string.  Past Rick tracks down and kills the Ricks from the photos: at a nightclub, at a house on another planet, in a futuristic maze. The Rick in the center of the maze has acquired a case with the future [[Council of Ricks|Council]] 2019s insignia on it. Out of it he pulls a box with a glowing sphere inside it. Past Rick shoots him. The other Rick destroys the box and Past Rick kills him, then compares him to the photo. Again, no match.  Past Rick is older and an alcoholic. He sits in the ruined garage with dead Ricks strewn about the yard. Portals open and Ricks with weapons emerge. He kills them all the moment they appear.  In a theater, Ricks are having a conference on the threat Past Rick poses. Past Rick portals into the theater and kills the Rick at the podium. He blows up the theater, but spares the two surviving Ricks when they beg for their lives.  Past Rick sits at a table with four other Ricks, recognizable as members of the Council. They show him a plan for the Citadel. Past Rick is disgusted.  Later, Past Rick flies by the completed Citadel and crash lands in a world where Beth is still alive. The garage is on fire and Beth looks at Rick with tears in her eyes.  Past Rick shows Morty how to use a portal gun.  Past Rick and Morty are laughing together in a field. The vision zooms out from that point to show the entire Finite Curve, all the orbs of the many different universe with Ricks and Mortys.)  (Morty comes out of the memory trance.)     Morty:    Woah. Dead wife?  (Rick puts Morty down.)     Rick:    Yes. Now everyone can shut up about it.     Morty:    Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that.  (A light comes on ahead of them.)     President Morty:    Of course that 2019s the case. In their minds, they 2019re the underdog.  (Rick shoots at President Morty, but the shot ricochets off the glass barrier.)     President Morty:    And that 2019s how they justify this.  (President Morty presses a button on a remote. Images of Ricks from across the Finite Curve materialize around them. Rick laughing at an injured Morty. Rick giving Morty a wedgie. Rick with Morty in a chokehold.  The view changes and more scenes are visible. In one orb, there 2019s an image of Rick holding a bloody knife. In another, Rick is passed out drunk on a bed. Yet another shows Rick with flames behind him.)     Rick:    Morty, I 2019m not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there.     President Morty:    They literally all say that. They all have that excuse; it 2019s part of their system. None of them have to be responsible, they re all victims of themselves.  2018Oh, it 2019s so hard to be a genius. Couldn 2019t you just die? 2019     Morty:    Well what are you doin 2019 about it?     President Morty:    Jack shit. I 2019m leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around infinity, separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he 2019s the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib, built around an infinite fucking baby.  (Events from various universes on the Finite Curve are shown: Rick sitting at his workbench with a pained expression, Rick wearing his  2018King of Shit 2019 crown, an injured Morty holding an injured Rick, Rick sadly sitting down in a chair next to a device with a memory tube in it.)     President Morty:    And I 2019m leaving it. That 2019s what makes me  2018evil 2019, being sick of him. If you 2019ve ever been sick of him, you 2019ve been evil too.     Morty:    Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you?  (Rick looks away and says nothing.)     President Morty:    There you go, kid. Now you 2019re Evil Morty too. Sooner or later, we all are, on this side of the Curve.  (President Morty puts on an eyepatch and presses the top right corner, activating a beam from the Dimensional Drive. A hole starts opening in the Curve.)  [Ext. Citadel, Plaza and Tramway]  (Portal fluid bursts from the ground, sweeping away everything in its path. Explosions occur across the Citadel, which tilts on its axis.)     Orange Afro Rick:    Don 2019t worry, Morty. We still got a way out they never thought of. [[Operation Phoenix]].     Orange Afro Morty:    Doesn 2019t that still mean, like, death?  (Orange Afro Rick pulls out a gun and hands it to his Morty.)     Orange Afro Rick:    Sure, but the joke 2019s on them cuz we just found a backdoor to getting off this rock.  (Orange Afro Morty shoots his Rick. A pillar falls on him, crushing him to death.)  [Trans. Int. Operation Phoenix Vats]  (Orange Afro Morty opens his eyes in a vat.)     Female computer voice:    Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.  (Ricks and Mortys wake up in vats with blender blades at the bottom. They are liquefied, and the blood is sent to power the beam opening a hole in the Finite Curve.)     Female computer voice:    Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.  (The vats are shown to be in the chamber that Rick, Morty, and President Morty are standing in. As the machine is fed blood, the beam from the Dimensional Drive grows stronger.)     Morty:    Oh my fucking god!     Rick:    Come on Morty, we gotta go!  (The room shakes and debris falls from the ceiling. Rick is trapped underneath a heavy plank of wood.)     Morty:    Woah!     President Morty:    You can come if you want.  (President Morty, now in a spacesuit, steps out of the glass dome around the control panel. A small spaceship is next to him.)     President Morty:    Don 2019t blame me if you don 2019t.     Rick:    Ugh. From where I sit, Morty, that 2019s the best deal on the table. I-I don 2019t have a real plan.  (Morty lifts the plank of wood off of Rick. Rick gets to his feet.)     Rick:    Thanks, pal. I-I 2019m glad you ignored my advice.     President Morty:    It 2019s just as well. I lied. That second seat 2019s a toilet.     Morty:    Oh, super dick move. But weirdly kind of cool to admit it.     Rick:    Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let 2019s go.  (Rick and Morty run out of the chamber.)  [Ext. Citadel Street]  (Rick and Morty climb out of a manhole. Around them, deformed Mortys are crawling out from the sewers. A wave of portal fluid washes towards them.  They all get on a train and head for a different part of the Citadel: Mortyburg. Rick, Morty, and all the other Mortys on the train disembark.)     Rick:    Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas.  (Rick presses a button labeled  2018DISENGAGE 2019. The entrance to Mortyburg closes and an alarm sounds. The circular section of the Citadel separates from the main body, and thrusters engage.)  ([[For the Damaged Coda]] begins to play.)  (A hole opens up in space behind them, sucking the detached portion of the Citadel towards it. Rick struggles to activate the boosters.)  [Ext. Citadel, Space]  (The beam shuts off, leaving a rift in the Curve.)  [Int. Citadel Dimensional Drive Chamber]  (President Morty straps himself into the personal spaceship. The robotic arm holding the ship upright loads it into the exit chute. A pneumatic arm engages and shoots the spaceship out the bottom of the Citadel.  President Morty approaches the rift in the Central Finite Curve. Behind him, explosions erupt throughout the Dimensional Drive chamber.)  [Ext. Citadel, Space]  (Rick is still struggling to engage the boosters. Then he sees the sign:  BOOSTER CONTROL MUST OPERATE WITH PARTNER .  Rick offers his hand to Morty, pulling him towards the control panel against the G forces pulling them backwards towards the rift in space. They activate the boosters together.  Rick pulls his portal gun out of his pocket. There 2019s no more fluid left in it. They both turn and watch the Citadel explode.)  [Ext. Central Finite Curve Rift]  (President Morty watches in awe as he breaks through the barrier. Finally, his thrusters turn off and he is floating in the space between universes. He opens the front of the spaceship and presses a button on one of his wrist pads. A holographic representation of the Central Finite Curve is projected into the air in front of him, then bursts like miniature fireworks.  President Morty takes out a [[President Morty s Portal Gun|golden Portal Gun]] and creates a golden colored portal. He steps inside, and the portal closes behind him.)  [CREDITS]  [Int. [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] 2019s Apartment]  (Mr. Poopybutthole turns off the TV playing the show credits.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    Woo-wee. Evil Morty. That was quite a scheme. Makes me wonder if there 2019s an evil me out there. But I guess, sometimes I look at my life, and I may not even need  2018im. Cuz, well, guess I made a pretty big mess of things myself. Ooo eee.  (He gets out of his chair and walks to the stove.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    I never got my job at the university back. Remember that? Rick made me do karate. It was kinda funny, but I guess things went downhill from there.  (He picks up a ramen package off the counter and opens it.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    Started isolating myself from Amy. Used to tell her everything I was feeling.  (He dumps the noodles into the pot on the stove.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    But then I guess I stopped.  (He picks up a photo of Amy.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    Cuz I wanted her to love who she thought I was, not who I felt myself becoming.  (He puts the photo of Amy back down.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    Ever think about how horrified the people we love would be if they found out who we truly are? So we just dig ourselves deeper, into our lies every day (he walks back over to the stove), ultimately only hurting the people who were brave enough to love us.  (He pours the seasoning packet into the pot, then throws the empty packet on the ground.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    Wish I didn 2019t do that.  (He reaches into the sink and pulls out a fork. He turns off the stove and starts stirring the ramen.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    Wish I was brave enough to love them back. I don 2019t know, maybe you should try it.  (He carries the pot over to his chair and leans against the armrest.)     Mr. Poopybutthole:    We don 2019t have as much time as we think. Ooo eee.  [[Category:Season 5 transcripts]]""}]}}}"

Rick tries to fix his portal gun from [[Evil Morty]]'s sabotage by resetting the portal fluid, but accidentally causes a glitch that causes all people who have used portals to be sent back to their original dimensions \u2013 this includes Jerry, due to the events of \""[[Mortynight Run]]\"". He gives Summer instructions on how to get them back before the portal travelers are zapped away: Jerry to his [[Jerry's original dimension|original dimension]] after the mix-up at the [[Jerryboree]], Morty to the [[Cronenberged dimension]], and Rick to [[Dimension C-137]].  Rick gathers materials he needs from his old house while conversing with an AI of [[Diane Sanchez]] he once created to \""haunt\"" him. He decides that he has held on to her death and his plan for revenge for too long and resolves to move on and really settle in with the [[Smith Family]] he has come to care for. As he is departing the dimension through a wormhole created by Summer, however, the AI suggests that the Rick who killed her and Beth ([[Rick Prime]]) would also have been sent back to his original dimension by Rick's mistake with the portal fluid. In the Cronenberged dimension, Morty encounters his [[Jerry Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|dad]], who travels by himself after the deaths of his [[Beth Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Beth]] and [[Summer Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Summer]] and has adapted a Rick-like nihilistic philosophy: he rejects Morty's attempts to reconnect, reminding him that he abandoned the dimension and his family twice. Rick arrives to pick up Morty and reveals that the Cronenberged dimension is, in fact, Rick Prime's home dimension, and that Rick had originally settled here in hopes that he would one day catch him if he returned. They break into Rick Prime's lair, finding either him or a clone of him in a tube while pre-recordings of Rick Prime mock him. Rick goes on the offensive, once again wanting revenge for what Rick Prime did to his family, but Morty convinces him to stand down by reminding him he has a family back in [[Dimension C-131|a different dimension]] to worry about.  Space Beth finds herself caught up in a dispute between Beth and Summer, with Summer trying to bond with Space Beth as her cool \""space mom.\"" The pair of Beths argue over this while raiding the Citadel and fighting off five-dimensional monsters that came from the wormhole, though Summer is able to convince them to back down. After Rick and Morty return and save them from some aliens, they retrieve Jerry from his original dimension, one where the divorce never happened and the Smith family relationship is pretty much where it was in [[Season 2]] \u2013 making Jerry appreciative of the [[Season 3|brief period]] where he and Beth divorced. Before leaving, Jerry scolds his original family for their behavior and proclaims himself an interdimensional traveler.  The family returns to [[Dimension C-131]], where they encounter [[Jerry Smith (C-131)|the Jerry]] who was brought back to the house and has been taking a shower upstairs while waiting for them to sort everything out. However, he accidentally unleashes a cute but deadly parasitic Boogens named [[Mr. Frundles]] that takes over the world in mere seconds, forcing the entire family plus Space Beth to move to ''yet another'' [[Parmesan Dimension|replacement dimension]], where they coincidentally died at the exact moment of \""natural\"" causes \u2013 the only major difference is that residents of this dimension pronounce \""parmesan\"" strangely. In the new dimension, Beth and Space Beth make peace with each other, while Morty asks Rick if he's being used as bait for Rick Prime. Rick affirms that Rick Prime simply does not care about his family, remarking that in some ways, Rick Prime is the \""real deal\"".  In the [[Cronenberged dimension]], Jerry encounters none other than Rick Prime himself (he really had been inside the tube), who inquires about the whereabouts of Rick and Morty. Jerry feigns interest in an alliance to defeat the two before slashing Rick Prime's throat. Rick Prime reveals he can heal quickly and promptly shoots Jerry, expressing some admiration for Jerry's unusual ruthlessness before finishing him off and wondering how he got into the the Cronenberged dimension.",""":"""",""warnings"":{""main"":{""*"":""Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.""},""revisions"":{""*"":""Because \""rvslots\"" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

I thought I was better than this. Dramatic voiceover while stranded in space? I-I guess when you re dying, the first thing to go is your creativity. Citadel s gone, and-and the saucer we escaped in is out of power.     Alternate Morty:    Oh man, I m so scared in here  2026     Rick:    The extra Mortys went feral 2014     Alternate Morty:    Gahhhh!  [He is attacked and devoured by a pack of feral Mortys.]     Rick:    (  cont d  )  2014eh, some problems solve themselves. Been drinking a lot 2014Morty, I told you to write this down! I-I don t have a helmet like that Avengers guy did! 2014been drinking a lot of my piss. Portal gun s still broken 2014     Morty:    (  interrupting  ) Guess that was all part of Evil Morty s plan.     Rick:    Evil Morty? Can we stop flattering this guy? His plan was to monologue and fuck off! He basically threw a tantrum to announce he was quitting Twitter!     Morty:    Nobody quits Twitter. (  pauses  ) Hey, remember, like a second ago, when you pretended to not know who Iron Man was? Who was that for?     Rick:    Shh, shh, shush, Morty. This is how we go. Bear it with grace. (  addressing cybernetics  ) Spinal cord, Robitussin as a base, then surprise me. (  groans  )  [Morty crawls to Rick s side. They close their eyes, waiting for death.]  [The sound of tapping on glass resonates throughout the saucer.]  [Trans. A shot of the dome of the saucer. Through the glass, a woman is seen wearing a spacesuit and floating in space. Further away, [[Space Beth]] s spacecraft is seen. The camera zooms in to reveal that it is her who is tapping on the glass.]     Morty:    Mom!     Rick:    Beth, maybe!  [Beth cups her hands and begins to speak, but Rick and Morty hear nothing.]     Rick:    Is she trying to say something? (  yells  ) We-we can t hear you! How dumb are  2026 Beth, you re in a vacuum, sound travels on air! [He puts his head in his hands] Why am I yelling?  [Beth fiddles with a device on her arm. It projects a message:]     Space Beth:    (  in text  ) IS THIS A PRIVATE PARTY? OR CAN ANYONE JOIN?     Morty:    (  rolls eyes  ) Wow. Great.     Rick:    (  obvious distaste  ) Yeah, that s  2026 Wow. Really worth it. That was not worth it! It s corny! (  gestures  ) You! Corn! Dying of starvation here!     Space Beth:    WHEN I DECIDED TO SAY IT, I DIDN T KNOW IT WOULD BE  2026     Morty:    Oh my God, stop explaining! (  yells  ) Stop explaining!     Space Beth:     2026 SUBJECTED TO THIS SCRUTINY.     Rick:    Are you finished? (  pauses, exasperated  ) She s not finished.     Space Beth:    MAYBE I WON T RESCUE YOU.     Rick:    Oh, real mature.     Morty:    Oh, nice.     Rick:    Real classy.  [TITLE SEQUENCE]  [Ext. The Smith Residence. Beth s spacecraft lands on the driveway.]     Rick:    (  reassuringly  ) It was a good line, honey.     Space Beth:    (  with disdain  ) I didn t need it to be. I don t care what you think.  [Home Beth emerges from the garage with a couple sandwiches on a plate.]     Home Beth:    (  relieved  ) Oh my god, she found you. Here, eat. Eat.     Morty:    Oh hell yes!     Rick:    Hold on, buddy. Our systems could go into shock from solid food. (  addressing robot which rolls out from the garage  ) Digestibot, convert to nutrient mass.  [He stuffs a sandwich into Digestibot s mouth-shaped food receptacle. The sandwich is mashed up, processed, and its remains deposited into a bowl with a  ding . Rick hands the resulting mush to Morty. Morty takes a bite and gags.]     Rick:    I m just gonna risk it.  [He takes a bite and groans in satisfaction.]     Home Beth:    Since when do you guys get stranded? (  turns to Space Beth  ) Thank you, by the way.     Space Beth:    Almost left them out there.     Rick:    Portal travel s broken. [He takes another bite.] Mmm. Are these heirloom tomatoes? Digestibot, try these.  [He feeds a slice of tomato to Digestibot as Morty looks on in horror.]     Digestibot:    Yum. Yum.     Home Beth:    So you can t hop realities anymore? Does that mean you ll finally have to wash your robe?     Rick:    Good point. They need to reboot the Portal Index immediately.  [He moves over to his workbench and begins to work on his broken portal gun, emptying the portal fluid into a basin.]     Rick:    Basically just a hard reset on the fluid. Hold tight, the Earth s gonna shake a bit.  [He pulls a lever hooked up to the portal gun. The lights go out as the portal gun draws all power in the house. The whole setup buzzes, whirs, and emits a neon green glow before the glow spreads to the house. Shots of the house, the Earth, and the corpses of Ricks and Mortys in deep space as the glow spreads out from Rick s lab. The corpses begin flashing with the same colour as the portal fluid.]  [Int. Garage. The process powers down. Suddenly, our Rick and Morty begin flashing too.]     Space Beth:    Uhh  2026  [The lights come back on.]     Home Beth:    Oh!     Rick:    (  claps a hand to his forehead  ) Oh, shit.     Morty:    (  looks at his flashing hands  ) Wait, what? What s happening?  [Rick begins fumbling with the junk on his desk (offscreen) before pulling out a device showing what is presumed to be a schematic of the local group of universes.]     Rick:    Instead of resetting portal travel, I   may   have reset portal   travellers  . Too late to apologise.  [Jerry barges into the room.]     Jerry:    Rick, why am I pulsing green? And don t say you don t know, because you re pulsing green.     Morty:    (  worried  ) Rick, are we about to die?     Rick:    (  annoyed  ) No, we re about to vanish from this reality.  [He begins to collect various items to construct a makeshift device.]     Jerry:    That s totally dying!     Rick:    No it isn t! It s everyone from this reality returning to their reality of origin.     Morty:    Back to our original universes!     Rick:    I explained it fine, Morty. You re spoonfeeding spoons. Where is Summer?  [Summer walks in.]     Summer:    Oh nice, you guys are back. [She notices the flashing.] Whoa.     Rick:    (  urgently  ) Summer, three of us are one-way blind-hopping. You gotta help us get back. There s a protocol for this in your chores server, filename  booger-aids .  [He hands her the finished device.]     Summer:    Every file is  booger-aids !     Rick:    I 2014I hate naming things! Just search for words like  one-way blind-hop, reset map beacon .     Jerry:    (  terrified  ) Why do I have a reality of origin?     Rick:    There s no time to explain, Jerry. Counting on you, Summer! One-way blind-hop beacon protocol. (  raises arms in excitement  ) Here we gooooo!  [The pulsing continues, but the three displaced characters do not vanish. Rick stops in disappointment.]     Jerry:    So there was time to explain.     Rick:    Don t waste extra precious seconds with your pettiness, Jerry! (  to Summer  ) Summer, let s run down 2014     Summer:    One-way blind-hop reset beacon,  booger-aids .     Rick:    (  surprised  ) Cool. [Long pause.] Wow.     Jerry:    (  outraged  ) There was so much time to explain!     Rick:    Yes, fine! Hindsight is 20-20. Who has ever taken this long to vanish?     Jerry:    How did I end up   not   in my own universe? (  realises  ) Oh, my god. The [[Jerryboree]].     Rick and Morty:    (  deadpan  ) Oh, the Jerryboree!     Rick:    (  mockingly  ) Deep cut.  [They vanish. Summer sets down the device 2014now revealed to be a beacon 2014and gets to work opening a secret hatch on the floor.]     Home Beth:    Wait, but where s our real dad and our real Morty?     Summer:    (  cuts in  ) Buried in the backyard. [She disappears from view.]     Home Beth:      That s   what the possums are after.  [Int. Rick s Secret Basement. Summer is seen at her workstation which prints out her instructions (see [[Morty s Mind Blowers]]) and gives her a glowing coin. The twin Beths climb down the ladder to meet her.]     Space Beth:    Dad s got you in the family business too, huh?  [Summer heads to a vending machine on one end of the room and puts the coin in.]     Summer:    Yeah, Morty s an easy mark, but Rick pays me in things like  2026  [Out comes a pair of gloves with long sleeves made of a clear material. The fabric is absorbed into her skin. Summer proceeds to unsheathe a pair of long claws from her knuckles. She smirks.]     Summer:    (  cont d  ) Wolverine claws.     Space Beth:    Well, looks like you got this. See you guys in another 2014two years? [She turns to leave.]     Summer:    Or you could stick around for this one? Looks like it involves Grandpa s grotty citadel. (  pleading  ) We could, you know, break things, loot stuff.     Space Beth:    (  hesitates  ) I should  2026 probably get back to  2026 saving the galaxy.     Summer:    Please?     Space Beth:    (  gives in  ) Guess I could loot some stuff. Fine. Yeah. Okay. Let s make it quick.     Home Beth:    (  feigns excitement  ) Awesome, I ve never been. Let s do this. Okay. Adventure family. Woo! (laughs)     Summer:    Uhh  2026 Okay!  [Ext. Rick s Garage in Dimension C-137. The garage door is open, with the blast marks from [[Rick Prime]] s bomb clearly visible. A blueprint of Rick s first portal gun is pinned up on the wall.]  [Rick materialises in the driveway.]     Rick:      Fuck  .  [He enters the garage. He first touches the blast centre, then replays a holographic recording of his encounter with Rick prime.]     Rick Prime:    (  offended  ) Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don t pass on this.  [The holograph vanishes. As Rick regains his bearings, a female voice calls from the next room over.]     Voice:    Rick, is that you?     Rick:    (  defeated  ) Yeah, Diane.     Diane:    You ve been gone so long. (  passive-aggressively  ) Did you find our daughter s killer?     Rick:    Not yet, sorry. Still looking. [He blows the dust off a hidden safe.]     Diane:    You ll find him. You always do everything you set your mind to, except keep your family alive. But that was hardly your fault.     Rick:    (  ashamed, to the AI  ) Mute.     Diane:    (  distorted  ) If I could be muted, I wouldn t be too-too-too good at haunting you, would I, you dirty bear?     Rick:    Yeah. I forgot I wanted to be haunted. [He keys in the code to the safe. He reaches in and pulls out a bottle of liquor and a tumbler glass.]     Diane:    I guess you predicted you might. That s where haunting comes in handy, huh?     Rick:    Very good point, sugar.  [Ext. Smith Residence of the [[Cronenberged dimension]]. The house is in an even worse condition than in [[The Rickshank Rickdemption]], with moss, overgrowth, and trees reclaiming the area.]  [Morty materialises on the pavement. He heads into the dilapidated building and explores its innards.]     Morty:    Rick?  [He enters the living room and heads up the stairs.]     Morty:    Hello? Original family? Sorry about last time. Rick, he was in space prison. We couldn t just 2014hello?  [He opens the door to his old room. A hostile Cronenberg jumps out.]     Morty:    Aaaah!  [He runs. The Cronenberg gives chase. Morty runs into Rick s basement, where he pushes a shelf over and finds a dagger. As the Cronenberg rushes in, he tussles with and kills the monster.]     Morty:    (  disgusted  ) Aw, geez.  [He climbs to the roof and sees a pillar of smoke in the distance.]     Morty:    Ah!  [Morty is seen walking by the remains of an old house and a relatively intact camping van, carrying a backpack and water canteen and holding a spear. A pile of smouldering charcoal 2014the remains of a fire 2014is front and centre. Morty inspects the ground and finds footprints heading away. He follows.]  [Int. of a grocery store. As Morty walks in and looks around, he spots a porno stand in one corner of the store.]     Morty:    (  aroused  ) Oh!  [He flips open one as a shadowy figure approaches him. Morty notices, and in alarm, throws a spear at the figure and hits its shoulder. The figure gasps in pain, and, as he moves into the light, reveals himself to be [[Jerry Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|a bearded Jerry]].     Original Jerry:    Agh! Ah, fuck! Dammit Morty, there s no doctors anymore.     Morty:    (  in disbelief  ) Dad!?  [Space. Beth s spaceship flies towards the ruined [[The Citadel|Citadel of Ricks]]. The rift caused by [[Evil Morty]] s escape is seen at bottom right.]  [Int. Citadel. The twin Beths and Summer head deeper into the ruins, clad in spacesuits.]     Home Beth:    Figures it s underwhelming, the one time I visit.     Summer:    Yeah, sorry, usually, there s cowboy Rick and Mortys and stuff.     Home Beth:    Looks like they could use a couple repairmen Ricks and Mortys, right?  [They reach Evil Morty s launch chamber. The place is ruined, with piping and broken glass lining the platforms leading up to the launch track. The trio spots a group of scavengers looking for loot.]     Summer:    Oh, tight! Little scavenger dudes. If they shoot at us, I m allowed to  2026  [The scavengers promptly shoot at the trio.]     Summer:    (  cont d  ) do this. [She unsheathes her claws and dashes at the scavengers.] Shit, yeah.  [She begins slicing the scavengers to pieces. The surviving scavengers are enraged by this.]     Summer:    Space Mom, get in on this!  [Space Beth launches homing bullets at the scavengers, killing most of the others. The bullets return to her hand and are revealed to be her fingers.]     Summer:    Cool Mom.     Space Beth:    Let s keep it moving. I don t have all day.  [A lone straggler appears and roars at the pair, but is promptly shot down by Home Beth. They are shot in the side and are in great pain.]     Home Beth:    I got it! I got it. (to the straggler) Sorry! [She fires again.] Sorry! [And again.] I got it. Sorry!  [She fires at the wounded scavenger at point-blank range multiple times and even hits their head with her blaster but fails to kill them, causing further agony. Space Beth puts them out of their misery by blowing a hole in their chest with a high-powered gun.]     Home Beth:    (  awkwardly  ) I was  2026 gonna do it  2026     Summer:    (  to Space Beth, mockingly  ) Ugh, terrestrials, am I right?  [Int. Rick s Garage in C-137. Rick has built a much fancier version of his [[Space Cruiser]] which occupies most of the space in the garage. A copy of the beacon given to Summer has been mounted on the dashboard.]     Diane:    I kept up the search in your absence. You want a new list of potential locations?     Rick:    You re always just one room away, huh? [He grabs a bottle of beer from the kitchen fridge.]     Diane:    Yeah. Remember, if you thought you could see or touch me, it might give you a level of (  distorted  ) com-com-comfort.     Rick:    Right, can t have that. Come on, Summer. [He pulls up an image of the rift under the Citadel. The coordinates he is aiming for are undetermined.]     Diane:    Who s Summer? Should I be jealous? I hope (  distorted  ) Summer knows what happens to the people you love!  [This takes Rick down a notch.]  [The doorbell rings. Rick heads for the front door, arms his gun, and opens it. An ancient man is at the door. He has a cataract in his right eye and has a definite slouch.]     Old Man:    Hey, Rick!     Rick:    Hey, Mr Goldmanbachmajorian. S-still alive, huh? What s up?     Mr. GBM:    I was hoping you could help me make sense of a note I found this morning? It s written by someone claiming to be me. They say my mind is  held captive in a time loop, trapped in the day of a traumatic event by the agony of a formidable intelligence, but also that my captor forgot about aging, that my body spoils and yearns for death while my soul remains stuck in place, caught like a fly in amber.   [Rick looks around. An old man, though not as old as Mr. GBM, in the garb of a newspaper boy riding a bike tosses a paper on the front lawn of the Sanchez residence, where piles of identical newspaper have built up. An old crone dressed as a hippie drags the bare skeleton of a dog along the pavement. She waves absently at Rick and Mr. GBM.]     Rick:    (  with guilt  ) Right. I used to   drink   drink. (  turns to Mr. GBM  ) Uhh  2026 no clue pal.     Mr. GBM:    That s okay. I found other notes in the trash just like it. Poor weirdo. I pity them. Wish they could let go and move on.     Rick:    Sounds healthy.     Mr. GBM:    Sure would be!  [Rick shuts the door and opens a hidden panel to the left, revealing a lever and pulling it. The sound of something powering down is heard. A dull thump is heard, followed by a gasp of relief issued by (presumably) Mr. GBM.]     Mr. GBM:    Aaah, sweet death!  [Int. Garage.]     Diane:    Was that symbolic? Are you letting go? I understand, baby. I forgive you!     Rick:    (  cuts in from inside the cruiser, furious  )   You   don t get to say that, you re not her! You re a thing I built to torture myself. (  aside  ) This whole fucking timeline is cursed. I gotta get out of here.     Diane:    Because you want to move on.     Rick:    Because I don t! And (burps) I have to. I came back on accident. The guy I m looking for, he s... he s not findable, Diane. [He closes his eyes in regret.] I live with a version of Beth now.     Diane:    Sounds like a version of nice.  [Rick fiddles with the beacon.]     Rick:    We have grandkids. That s who Summer is. She s going to get me out of here. (  looks towards the empty doorway  ) She reminds me of you.     Diane:    Oh really? Is she dead too?     Rick:    (  ignores her, despondent  ) Bye, Diane.     Diane:    You re not honestly going to fly into that rift without coordinates, are you? Don t give up on us, Rick. I don t make the rules. Haunters gonna haunt.  [Rick steels himself. The cruiser flies out of the garage, Mr. GBM s lifeless arm and his note in view.]  [Trans. to Rick aiming his cruiser straight for the rift. The undetermined coordinates manifest as a yellow dot darting around the dashboard display. The voice of Diane follows him.]     Diane:    Baby, are you killing yourself?     Rick:    I m more embracing the win-win of risking my life.  [He enters the rift. Myriad patterns appear all around him as he traverses what is assumed to be extradimensional space.]  [Trans. Cronenberged Dimension. Morty and Original Jerry are sitting around a campfire back in the original Smith residence.]     Morty:    Where s Mom and Summer?     Original Jerry:    Oh, they re gone. Sorry, Morty.     Morty:      Gone   gone?     Original Jerry:    We spent a long time in that ice. A gentle mutant licked us out, but Beth got sick and Summer... didn t thaw right.   (Original Jerry grunts as he cauterizes his wound using a dagger)      Original Jerry:    With no one left to blame, I finally had to deal with myself. Buried my grief at Barnes & Noble. \""Four Agreements\"", \""Eat Pray Love\"", Frank Miller s \""The Dark Knight Returns\"". Learned to accept things for what they are.  (Original Jerry grunts as he cuts open the dead Cronenberg s head, then reaches inside and pulls out its brain)     Original Jerry:    In a few of these, the whole brain is still intact. Makes you wonder if some people were still in there, (cuts open the brain using a cleaver) just trapped in the horror. Anyway, it s awesome protein.     Morty:    I m so sorry, Dad. But my real, original Dad beat the apocalypse. I-I-I guess we all underestimated you. Hey, w-what s that game we always try to play as a family, y 2014the one we never finished?     Original Jerry:    Downbeat.     Morty:    Yes! Let s play Downbeat. I-I bet I can find it! We can finish now!     Original Jerry:    Yeah, you should totally do that.  (Morty rushes out of the room, peeks under a bed and finds \""Downbeat\"".)     Morty:    Hey, yeah, cool, I-I got it! We ll play Downbeat and we ll-we ll camp here tonight and then rebuild the house. (Starts carrying the box out of the room and downstairs) You know, we got food, fresh water, and we ve got family.  (Morty has now headed back to the fire, only to realize that Original Jerry had left and that there was a note taped to the sofa.)     Morty:    The fuck? (drops the game and runs over to read the note on the sofa)     Original Jerry:    (written) Morty. I wrote this note in advance in case you re wondering how I left so fast. My plan is to wait for you to turn your back, them I m going to grab all your shit and split. Depending on how long you were out of the room, you ll probably be thinking I can t be that far away and you ll want to foll 2014  (Morty drops the note and runs toward the door, only to be caught in a trap and hanging upside down from a rope in front of the doorway. Morty sees another note taped above the doorframe.)     Original Jerry:    (written) Morty, wrote this fast  cause had to set trap. Thought you d have cooler shit. See other note. Bye.     Morty:    Motherfu 2014 [Black Screen]   [Trans. Original Jerry walking through the woods.]     Morty:    (offscreen) Whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!  (Morty appears riding a speedy Cronenberg.)     Morty:    Not cool! Oh!   (Morty is tossed off the Cronenberg and lands on the ground)     Morty:    What the hell, Dad?     Original Jerry:    Don t take it personal, Morty. That s one of the Four Agreements. I don t remember the other three, but I know Commissioner Gordon was cool with Batman moving on.     Morty:    Batman doesn t abandon people!     Original Jerry:    You abandoned us.     Morty:    I deserve that. But, you know, it... it improved you.     Original Jerry:    Oh, am I cool enough for you now? Well, that was easy, it only cost me fucking   everything!       Morty:    Whoa, hey, I-I 2014     Original Jerry:    You came back and talked about us like we weren t people, Morty! Then you bailed and left us to freeze!     Morty:    I-I was apologizing for that earlier 2014     Original Jerry:    Your mom and sister   died  , Morty! (sighs) And I moved on. From caring. And that is the best deal you will ever get. So take it.     Morty:    Please don t go! I-if Rick comes back, we ca-we can find you a new reality. A new Mom, a new Summer, a... job!     Original Jerry:    Oh, you don t get it, kid. Except for this conversation, my life is perfect. Rick was always right. (starts to leave) Everyone needs to let go.  (Morty starts sobbing as the Cronenberg comes back)     Morty:     Aww, you came back. I guess we really did form a bond.  (The Cronenberg bites Morty.)     Morty:    Ow! Hey, stop it! Get away from me! (The Cronenberg roars and chases Morty.) No! Help!  [Trans. The Citadel. Summer places the beacon down.]     Summer:    Alright, pin dropped, Grandpa!  (The beacon flashes blue.)     Summer:    Come and get us.  [Trans. Rick travelling inside the Space Cruiser.]     Rick:    Come on, come on, come on!     Diane:    Baby? Something to keep in mind 2014if you were pulled home by whatever happened, it s likely our target was, as well. It s also likely he s having as much trouble leaving as you are.     Rick:    He s trapped.  (The Space Cruiser s monitor starts beeping.)     Summer:    Grandpa!     Rick:    Oh, fuck yes!  (The Space Cruiser heads faster, while a space monster heads through behind it)     Summer:    Grandpa 2014Grandpa?     Rick:    Summer! Gold star, always believed in you. N-now the hard part.     Summer:    Hard part?     Rick:    Way worse things than me can see that beacon, too. Hunker down and protect it while I grab Morty. Rick out! Try to survive!     Summer:    Oh, shit. (The space monsters start heading toward them) Domestic Mom should hide, maybe?     Home Beth:    \""Domestic Mom?\""  (They start to fight the space monsters.)     Summer:    I mean, she s the cool space one.     Space Beth:    Look, I m not looking to get caught in whatever this is. You guys can both hide maybe, hash it out.     Home Beth:    Oh, quit talking down. I m you with the patience to do laundry.     Summer:    Mom, stop being jealous of our bond!     Home Beth:    She ran from our choices. I have to parent them.     Space Beth:    It s not like I didn t care. That s what the clone was for. Aah!  (Home Beth and Space Beth are devoured alive by a monster)     Summer:    Moms!  [Trans. Cronenberged Dimension. Morty is panting and sobbing when Rick s Space Cruiser crash-lands in the distance. Morty runs towards it. Rick gets out of the Space Cruiser as many drones fly out of it.]     Rick:    Morty!     Morty:    Rick? I knew it! I knew you wouldn t leave me!  (Rick pulls a hair off of Morty s head)     Morty:    Ow! The fuck?  (Rick scans the hair using a device on his wrist and activates all the drones)     Rick:    Morty, did you see another Rick here? Nondescript haircut, sci-fi jacket? (The device on his wrist displays a holographic map of the universe) Eh, of course you didn t see him, you d be dead. Or you d be a bomb. Do you feel bomby? Nah, you woulda blown up by now.     Morty:    Wasn t the Rick here dead? Th-th-that s why you pick places, right?     Rick:    Uh, well, your Rick, uh, yeah, not dead, more like, not around. When I met you, I was sorta hoping he might turn up one day 2014(a location of the holographic map starts to beep) You son of a bitch! I got you!  (Rick hops inside the Space Cruiser, followed by Morty)     Morty:    W-w-where are we going?     Rick:    To kill your grandpa, little buddy.     Morty:    Wait, what?  [Trans. Space Cruiser has taken off again and is flying through space.]     Morty:    I don t understand. My original Rick killed your family? And you were just waiting for him to come back?     Rick:    Seems like you understand fine, Morty. That was A+ re-piping. (Space Cruiser stops) We re here.  (Space Cruiser lands on an invisible floor and Rick steps out)     Rick:    This guy, Morty, he hates being found but loves building elaborate shit. Like-like-like playing a ton of [[Minecraft]] but all on a private server.     Morty:    Am I in a fucking K-hole right now? What is going on?  (Rick throws a glowing green pyramid-shaped device. It bursts and [[Rick Prime]] s hideout becomes visible.)     Rick Prime:    (on a pre-recorded video displayed on a hologram projection) Whoa-ho-ho, you found me!  (Rick destroys the screen by shooting a laser at it, but a second screen pops up)     Rick Prime:    I shoot the first monitor, too. Listen, I m not here. Or am I?  (A glass container pops out, with a naked Rick inside, shivering.)     Rick Prime:    There s the clone you found! Or maybe it s me, all naked! Just a lil  Keyser Soze. I mean, why would I admit it s not?  (The Rick inside the chamber starts dancing)     Rick Prime:    Oh-hoho, yeah! Look at him! Look at him go! Look at him dance! O-or me. Again, it might be me, like a \""Saw\"" thing. I m very sneaky. Here s a bunch of killbots to deal with while ya wrestle with that.  (Many killer drones appear, activate lasers, and head toward Rick, Morty, and the Space Cruiser, but Rick jumps in front of Morty and activates an energy shield around them and the cruiser, which is destroyed by the lasers instead. Rick shoots some of the killbots while Morty gets in the cruiser.)     Rick Prime:    Obviously, I don t know who I m talking to here.   (Rick runs toward the chamber with the Rick inside, but the platforms start to move.)     Rick Prime:    It s all prerecorded.  (Rick jumps across some platforms while taking out some of the drones.)     Rick Prime:    But if you got this far, you probably think you re real special. Tell you what...  (The glass chamber containing the Rick slides down a tube.)     Rick Prime:    Oop! There he goes! Maybe that actually was me! If you follow him down there, we can do a big fight. Fifty percent chance I m not lying.  (Rick s arms are shot by some killer drones and fall off, but new ones with laser whips attached grow in their places. Rick destroys some more robots.)     Space Beth:    (through the communication device in the Space Cruiser) We re in trouble, asshole! I shouldn t have to beg.     Morty:    Wait, my moms are in trouble?     Rick:    Those versions of them are.     Morty:    W-we gotta save them! Rick, this is an obvious trap. If you go down there he s just gonna kill you.     Rick:    Good!     Morty:    What? (Gets out of the cruiser)     Rick:    Now what?     Morty:    If you don t care if you die, why do you care if I die?     Rick:    Knock it off! Get out of here! You did this last season! You re like a suicide bomber!     Morty:    Takes one to know one.     Rick:    Yeah, well, you get it from him, not me.     Morty:    I don t know him.   You re   my grandpa, Rick. Rick and Morty. A hundred years.     Rick Prime:    This place totally might go up, by the way. Here s a bunch of countdowns. One of them s probably accurate.  (Many holographic timers pop up.)  [Trans. Both Beths are inside the monster s stomach, still alive.]     Space Beth:    Ah, fucking stupid 5th-dimensional stomach juices.     Home Beth:    Sorry for the sitcom fight, and maybe getting us digested.     Space Beth:    You ve got incredible timing.     Home Beth:    Oh, don t be a bitch. I m parenting. Makes sense you don t recognize it. You ve been out of practice for a while.     Space Beth:    Good! I m glad that they have you! I don t want to be \""Space Mom.\""     Home Beth:    You ve made that clear. Just don t let Summer mistake your rejection of her for good taste.     Space Beth:    I m not trying to. It s all her!  (Metal claws rip through the monster s stomach. Space Beth gasps as both Beths fall out of the monster s corpse and onto a ruined chunk of the Citadel.)     Summer:    Jesus! It d be cool if you were around more. I don t wanna get married. I m 17. My affection is the wind. Don t try to compete for it. (pauses) I could hear every word of that through the helmets. Thank fuck I only had to kill most of them.     Home Beth:    Jesus, that ship really has sailed.  (All the monster corpses come together and form a massive beast with heads on each of its tentacles.)     Space Beast:    And now... we feast!  (Rick s Space Cruiser crashes into the beast. Rick gets out and starts spraying the beast with acid, killing it as it screams.)     Rick:    This emergency was oversold to me.     Summer:    Grandpa!     Home Beth & Space Beth:    Morty!     Morty:    Moms!  (Summer hugs Rick while both Beths hug Morty.)     Morty:    Wait, i-if they had to wear helmets 2014     Rick:    I do childproofing stuff while you re asleep.     Morty:    Why don t you childproof Dad?     Home Beth:    Ah, great reminder.     Rick:    Wait!     Home Beth:    Time to get Jerry.     Rick:    Ugh.  [Trans. Alternate Smith Residence, the one that our Jerry is in.]     Alternate Beth:    Maybe I wouldn t be so uptight if I wasn t married to an unemployed receptacle of human fear!     Alternate Summer:    Get a job, Dad, it s been a decade.     Alternate Rick:    Whoof. Pretty brutal, Jer. I-I know a good alligator park if you wanna kill yourself.     Alternate Morty:    I got expelled today.  (Doorbell rings)     Alternate Beth:    What the hell, Morty?!     Alternate Rick:    Oh, no, you got expelled. Whoa, what a horrible thing.     Alternate Beth:    You are so fucking dumb!  (Jerry leaves to open the door in the midst of the chaos)     Alternate Rick:    Too bad, Morty.  (Jerry opens the door to see his family waiting outside. Rick and Home Beth are at the door while Summer, Morty, and Space Beth are in the Space Cruiser)     Home Beth:    Hi, hon.  (Jerry gasps. Home Beth and Jerry hug.)     Rick:    Whoof, some real Season 2 vibes in there, you know what I m sayin ?     Jerry:    (to Home Beth) You know, never thought I d say this, but I think I m glad we spent that time divorced.  (All three start walking back to the Space Cruiser until Jerry stops)     Jerry:    Eh, one second.     Alternate Rick:    I ll build a fucking swing set in the backyard!     Alternate Beth:    What the hell Morty?  (Jerry comes back inside the house)     Jerry:    You know, I may technically be from here. But I m a goddamn interdimensional traveller now, and all of you 2014(flips everyone off) 2014can kiss my sci-fi ass.  (Starts walking backward for the door only to bump into it. Jerry opens the door and leaves.)  [Trans. Everyone has now headed back to their home universe. The family has just gotten inside. Everyone is laughing.]     Home Beth:    It gets me every time.     Morty:    Wow, what an amazing joke I just told. A-and also, what an adventure. You know, I guess it doesn t matter where we re from if we re together, huh? Good-good final moral thing.     Summer:    This is everyone s original dimension now.     Rick:    Great wrap-ups, kids.     Season 2 Jerry:    Ugh, you re back.     Rick:    Oh shit, Season 2 Jerry!     Season 2 Jerry:    Look, before you bust my balls, can someone help with the shower? It s colder than Beth on her anniversary. Also... [Holding up a container with [[Mr. Frundles]] inside] Look what I found in Rick s room!     Mr. Frundles:    Mmm, I m Mr. Frundles!     Season 2 Jerry:     I don t care how cute he is, we agreed! No Boogens in the house! [Releases Mr. Frundles from the container and onto the ground]     Rick:    Wait, Season 2 Jerry! Don t!      Mr. Frundles:    Nyaah! (Mr. Frundles bites Season 2 Jerry s leg, causing him to yelp and fall to the ground)     Morty:    Oh!     Summer:    Mr. Frundles!     Rick:    Everybody in the car.  [Season 2 Jerry s leg turns into Mr. Frundles]     Mr. Frundles (Season 2 Jerry s Leg):    Mmm, I m Mr. Frundles!     Jerry:    Wait, but I thought he was Mr. Frundles. [Pointing to the original one]     Rick:    Everybody in the car! Now!  [Floor carpet becomes (species of) Mr. Frundles after the Mr. Frundles on Season 2 Jerry s leg bites it, but after our family left house. The Mr. Frundles on Season 2 Jerry s leg bites Season 2 Jerry s face, causing him to turn into Mr. Frundles. The infection spreads faster and faster.]     Many species of Mr. Frundles:    (voices overlapping each other) Mmm, I m Mr. Frundles!  [The Smith family leave Earth in Rick s space cruiser while the entire continent of North America bites South America and infects it.]     Beth:    What the fuck Dad?! Why would you bring that thing into our house?     Rick:    It was cute! Fuck we gotta find a new timeline now! You know how hard that shit is without portals? We gotta do the thing with the Rift and the beacon again! The whole fucking episode all over again! Car, fabricate some vomit bags.     Space Beth:    Can t we just go back and fix it?  [They see Earth itself taken by Mr. Frundles.]     Mr. Frundles (Earth):    Mmm, I m Mr. Frundles!  [Trans. The Smiths have now arrived in an alternate timeline. An alternate version of the Smith family (for some reason including Space Beth) has suffered a gruesome death. The entire living room is destroyed.]     Summer:    I can t believe portal travel s broken.     Rick:    I ll get to it when I get to it.     Morty:    Lift with your knees, Mom.     Home Beth:    How many times have you done this?  [Jerry vomits, his Rick and Morty wasn t [[:File:S1e6_blood_everywhere.png|exploded to death]] and disgusted at the scene]  [Trans. The Smith family is now burying the dead bodies in the backyard.]     Jerry:    (grunts) Oh, God.     Home Beth:    And you swear they die of natural causes?     Rick:    Mm-hmm, yep.     Space Beth:    The exact same as our old timeline? Even my stuff?     Rick:    Bit of a rush job, actually, so they do say \""parmesan\"" weird.     Morty:    How do they say 2014     Rick:    Par-mees-ian.     Summer:    Boo.     Jerry:    Jesus Christ.     Rick:    I could ve left you guys! You think the concept of family matters to me? I m not even your Rick!  [The rest of the Smiths, excluding Morty, start leaving.]     Summer:    Uh-huh.     Jerry:    \""I m Denial Rick!\""     Home Beth:    See you inside, Dad.  [Trans. Both Beths are alone in the kitchen.]     Home Beth:    Sorry I was such a Dance Mom about Summer. She s your daughter too.     Space Beth:    No, boundaries are good. But, uh, speaking of, maybe I ve put up too many. Is it okay if I come around sometimes?     Home Beth:    That could be nice.     Space Beth:    That s a cute outfit.     Home Beth:    The one we always wear?  [Trans. Back in the backyard with Rick and Morty.]     Rick:    (sighs) Yes, Morty?     Morty:    You promise I m not, you know, bait? T-to make that Rick come back?     Rick:    What? M-Morty, for you to be bait, the guy d have to value something. He truly does not give a shit. (pauses) He s the real deal.

Original Jerry:    Were you putting on pants?     Rick Prime:    What? Oh, yeah, no, I was naked to fuck with a guy. Speaking of, did you talk to me, or a little kid around here?

Morty, who was playing ''[[Roy: A Life Well Lived]]'' when the gang attacked, becomes trapped in the game with his mind spread out across the various NPCs, forcing Rick to go into the game as [[Roy]] to try to get Morty out. Summer, in the meantime, is instructed by Rick to \""do a ''Die Hard''\"" to fight back against the aliens (who as it turns out are led by a certified expert on ''Die Hard'') even though she has not seen the movie. Ultimately, she uses this to her advantage, taking the aliens by surprise by not following tropes used in ''Die Hard''.  Inside the game, Rick as Roy's attempts to explain to the NPCs that they are all his grandson stuck in a video game is interpreted as starting a cult/religion, leading to a religious conflict of sorts. In order to get Morty out with his mind intact, Rick has to get all of the Mortys to agree to fly into space beyond the barriers of the game. With the help of a Morty named [[Marta]], they manage to get up to 92% to agree, but 8%, who have long since also realized they are in a video game, express that Rick is actually a jerk to them and they are better off in the game. Marta-Morty asks Rick to tell them he loves Morty and they will all agree to leave, but Rick's awkward hesitancy only proves their point. Decades pass in the game, as Marta joins the opposing side in rejecting Rick's attempts to free them. Eventually, she loses her will to keep fighting as some of the Morty NPCs age out and even her own children decide to join Rick. She commands the Mortys to leave the game, but tells Rick she herself will remain behind.  Rick and Morty are freed from the game just in time to help Summer, who manages to one-up the alien gang one last time by reading a plot summary of ''Die Hard'' and actually doing one of the tropes for once (i.e. taping a gun to her back). The three depart Blitz and Chips, but not before it is revealed to the audience that Rick paid for the ''Roy: A Life Well Lived'' game to remain powered on to allow Marta-Morty to live out the rest of her life in peace.  In a post-credits scene, the gang of aliens tries to do ''Die Hard 3'', made difficult by the fact that their previous leader died playing the Hans Gruber role at Blips and Chitz.",""":"""",""query"":{""normalized"":[{""from"":""Rick:_A_Mort_Well_Lived/Transcript"",""to"":""Rick: A Mort Well Lived/Transcript""}],""pages"":{""-1"":{""ns"":0,""title"":""Rick: A Mort Well Lived/Transcript"",""missing"":""""}}}

Sorry to call you honey, I know we're both parts of a -year-old boy, but my part's old-fashioned and vaguely Southern. I'm confused. If -- If you know Rick is real, why -- Why hold out?

During her stay, her relationship with Beth develops after they bond over a bottle of Venusian wine. Eventually, their casual flirting develops into a full-on love affair. [[Summer Smith|Summer]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] notice this first, and quickly become obsessed with playing an ultra-realistic alien video game in a bid to avoid thinking about it. Rick figures out what\u2019s going on and tells Beth while he understands (having done something similar himself over the years), she needs to think about how this will affect her family: he, Morty, and Summer quickly become concerned about Jerry, who had previously claimed he would kill himself if Beth left him. When Beth begins to express doubts, Space Beth admits to the affair in front of Jerry, who promptly rolls up into a pillbug (a protocol Rick built into him that he\u2019d forgotten about). Rick reveals that Jerry can only emerge from the pillbug by his own choice, and trying to force him out will only make things worse.  While Rick joins Morty and Summer in focusing on realistic video games, the two Beths soon find their fundamental difference in how they think of Jerry: Space Beth thinks he's pathetic and would rather leave him in the pillbug shell, while Beth still loves him and tries to encourage him to come out. Eventually, the two Beths decide to wipe their knowledge of each others\u2019 existence using Rick's Memory Wiping Machine, despite Rick pointing out this would just leave the rest of the family to deal with the knowledge of what happened. Jerry, overhearing this, leaves the shell and declares he won\u2019t let them lobotomize themselves over him, but says he is still leaving Beth. Eventually, it emerges that Jerry is more upset that the two Beths hooked up behind his back than the fact they did it and he actually quite enjoys being cuckolded. As Rick, Morty, and Summer uncomfortably listen from the dining room table, Jerry and the two Beths have an increasingly sexual conversation that culminates in all three of them hooking up. Rick is forced to calm Morty and Summer down as they finally break down over the situation.  Space Beth bids the family goodbye while promising to keep an eye out for her [[Naruto Smith|space grandson]]. Rick quickly gets rid of the Venusian wine that apparently caused the two Beths to fall for each other.  During a post-credits scene, Jerry visits the [[Jerryboree]] in an apparent attempt to pull the same love affair with himself that Beth did.

Anyway, I'm thankful for my wife. Beth. The Beth that chose me. I'm so grateful to you, and I literally could not live without you. Aw! Aw! Aw! I really mean that. If something were to happen to you, or if you were to leave me, or be unfaithful, I would die. Mm! Uh... Literally. Probably by my own hand. Eww. Okay. I know how I'd do it. Our first blender has an extra long cord and it was manufactured before safety fuses, so I'd draw a warm bath... And blend some stuff. Good toast, honey. To thankfulness. To... A-America? To ending the toast? To ending the toast! Just to, uh, be clear, I was saying I'd k*ll myself. Jerry. God! We know! Advertise your product or brand here contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today Sorry Jerry got all husbandy. Yeah, do not miss that. So I was thinking we could set you up in Jerry's man cave? Oh, that's okay, I'll sleep in my car. It's got a TARDIS thing going on, bigger on the inside. Dad calls it hack, but my soaking tub begs to differ. Hmm, maybe I'll trade you. Ohh! Agh! My lower back. Oh, I got this. Ah, Jesus, that was great. Well, you're me. I find this is usually the biggest help. Mmm, oh, I just love... the Venusian stuff. It's cool, I get insecure trying to pronounce this crap, too, but I got just the thing for that. Here. Um... Okay, sh**t that asteroid. Now sh**t that one. Now sh**t me in the face. This game's trash. I didn't want to say anything, but this does seem lame. Yeah, I thought it was maybe 'cause we've sh*t so many real asteroids. L-Let's look at the menu. Oh! T-There's the realism setting. Oh, cool. Also stupid. The factory setting is 4? What do we want, 10? No, do 9. I'm kidding. Shut up, Summer. Yeah, shut up, Summer. Put 10. This is the same. It's worse. It's... Oh. Oh. I get it. Okay. It's... It's more real. The vast majority of space is empty. What? Who cares? T-Then what am I doing? Looks like you can record a video for your kid in case you die. Not a bad idea, you're gonna be in space for a while. May as well. Um, hey, son. Uh... If you're seeing this, I... starved to death while looking for an asteroid. Ugh. This is stupid. You guys are obviously just trying to convince yourselves it's cool because you feel lame about it. Summer you know nothing about gamer culture. Bro, tell your son you love the shit out of him. Oh, I'm gonna! Of course we both can't sleep at the same time. Yeah, we do share a shitty back. Turn around. At least let me... Yes, please. Oh, my God. Okay, I know we're not massage people but you need this. See, you act like this bad ass space cowboy, but I know you're just a scared little overachiever that keeps all her OCD right... Oh, my God! Yeah. By the way you better be taking notes... I'm next. It's my back, you dumb bitch. Nice. What? Well, I better get back to bed. Yep. Same. Oh, so now you're into highly realistic video games? Maybe I decided real life was too much right now, or maybe I'm not afraid to change my mind about stuff. Maybe mental flexibility is stronger than stubbornness. Nice manip', Sum-Sum. Okay, I-I'm in the alley behind the library. - Uptown or downtown? - Shit, there's one uptown, too? It's okay, stay there, I think I'm near the red line. Is this ""Street Fighter""? ""Street Fighter"" where you start at the beginning of each fighter's day and have to find each other to fight. It's very realistic. Not even guaranteed a fight will happen. That meter filling up is us forgetting what made us so mad. If anyone's interested in a higher level of realism, I'm booting up the OG... That's Original Game, called a jigsaw puzzle... In the den. Hey, gang! Me and my space self are gonna make a run to the Gloppy Drop System for ice cream. Any flavor requests? - Vanilla! - Vanilla! Why do you guys have to go all the way to deep space just for ice cream? Gloppy Dropulites have less taste buds than humans. Their ice cream is like a hospital bed. It's designed for you to do less so it does more. Okay, see ya in a bit. I'll get started sorting all the obvious sky pieces. Secret technique. - Oh, shit, there you are! - Oh, f*ck, it's on, bitch! I'm gonna eat your ass! You will die in the street like a dog! Stunning. Thank you. This is incredible. Eh. Just glad I had something in your size. How far is Gloppy Drop? And why do I always think I'm wearing a watch? I actually have a pint of Gloppy Drop on a little apartment orbiting Earth. So we have time. You have your own space station? We have our own space station. We're the same person. There's differences. Like, one of us has no idea who she really is. Wrong. But let's make a deal. Let's trust ourselves enough to stop wondering who we are when we're together. We get to say anything to each other. Things we'd never say to anyone else, even ourselves. What don't we say to ourselves? How about, ""Wow, my ass looks good in that space suit""? I mean it. I'm a good-looking woman. Well, that's nice of you to say. I also... find myself... quite attractive. We forgot the ice cream. I want you back in my guts like I'm one of your sick little fillies. Oh, God damn it, Morty! You can't just take my controller Yes, I can! It's mine! Ugh. Okay, Sum-Sum, gimme. Make your own controller, some of us need all the control we can get. Ugh, f*ck you! So why are you so suddenly into realistic video games? I already was. Yeah, but now you're into them the way I am. You mean, like staring at them in a numb trance? Uh-huh. Not judging, just noticing. Yeah, y-you tend to notice stuff a little before I do. But eventually you do notice. And now we can both not notice together, yes. - Oh, my god... - Beth! I thought you said you got ice cream? Yeah, I, uh... It must be in the, uh... Oh, the car! We left it in the car. Okay, good, because that would have been weird! I worry things might become more and more noticeable. Yeah, and if he k*ll himself, we're gonna have to get a new dad Jesus Christ, Summer! Hey, Dad. Um, hmm, what's this? Making a controller. This species of bionic space whale has carbon wiring, great for smooth game play. I'm not k*ll it, for the record. I'm just replacing its esophagus with a better one. For free. I-It should thank me. And it will, with its mind. These things are telepathic, Beth. They talk to you in dreams. Does your replicator thing make ice cream from the Gloppy Drop system? Why would you want replicated Gloppy Drop ice cream, poser? Crazy thing. I went with Space Beth to get some, and we had such a great time we forgot the ice cream! Crazy, right? That's a real question? M-Maybe? Come here, hold the pup down. You're talking about an infinite father. I've met myself out there infinite times. Infinite shit happens. Including, as you put it, forgetting the ice cream. You've... forgotten the ice cream? Drill me for details when I'm drunker. In the meantime, don't worry about what's crazy. You know, as the kids say, you do you. Oh, thanks. Thank you so much, Dad. One thing to keep in mind, though. It's not just your own ice cream you're forgetting. It's your family's. If you forget it too much, you start having to keep secrets. Oh, and you're against secrets? Against? Hell no. Secrets are great. For instance, I've had a pint of vanilla Gloppy Drop in my fridge this whole time. Take it. I'm just saying, lies pile up. Like credit card debt. You retain an advantage by staying liquid. Gotcha. Well... I'd call this a simple cash transaction. Fun and done. Favorite Culkin. - Kieran! - Kieran! Favorite song by Britney. ""Work Bitch""! ""Work Bitch""! Favorite hangover cure. Hair of the dog with a guilty Hair of the dog with a guilty pleasure like ""Humans Weekly."" pleasure like ""Us Weekly."" I told Dad. I mean, I didn't have to. He knew. I guess that's one reason you didn't have to tell him. What'd he say? We kind of talked in code, I think he said it's fine until it makes us feel indebted to our lessers. That sounds like Dad. Do we owe... the family an explanation? Do we have to spend our time together figuring out how to please others? I'm married. We both are, but I'm in our marriage. It's the defining difference between us. Well, there's no rule book that says you have to be. What's gonna happen? What is this? Are we in love... with our self? I mean, does that make us the most or the least healthy woman in the universe? Anybody ever tell you you're overly analytical? Which I do love. If that's what you need to call it. I don't need to call it anything. I would like to know... its shelf life. I might know a way to gather that data. Motel room! The Holodeck! I like yours better. Hmm... Uh... Beth! Uh, m-my Beth! Well, not ""my"" Beth, but... I finished! It's done! Kids, do you know where your moms are? Oh, you're busy with your GamePod. Don't worry about it, I'll find those two somewhere. No! No, Dad, um, come play video games with us! Okay, Dad, here's the infinite menu screen. Oh, I dunno. Here, here, I-I'll have the console choose a game! Um, maybe let's skip this one? Really? Why? Looks fun! Oh, okay, so we are a woman married to a man but having a sexual affair with another woman! Very spicy. Very spicy, Jer. G-Good job. Looks pretty single player, kids? Seriously, you two?! What the hell did you do in my Holodeck?! Holy shit, you... you did a full ""San Junipero"" in here? Oh, my God, Beth, there's masturbating and then there's masturbating. Ew, Dad stop, I'm sorry! You'd know, old man. Argh! Look, this isn't my business, and by all means, enjoy being sapphic horse girls together. But you suck at doing it secretly. We all know. Including Jerry?! No, Dad's so in the dark that he's enjoying a video game about being in an affair right now. If you guys are doing this, you got to tell him! Okay, little man, back off. Take it easy. They're right. Right about what, that we have to be twice as considerate and twice as repressed because some dick split us in two? This is the shit I left. This isn't. This is me. This is the me that doesn't tell you all to f*ck off. So allow me. f*ck off. She'll tell her husband what she wants when she feels like it. And you can deal with it or you can deal with me. But you should know I have all the Predator w*apon. Works for me. Fair enough. That's cool. I guess it's time for ice cream. Come on, kids, you're inhaling this stuff. Your Moms went to space. Did you even thank them for doing it? Thanks for... doing it, Moms. Very selfless of you. Eat your ice cream however you want. Nothing good lasts forever. Okay, come on, it's Thanksgiving. The least we can do is speak English. Jerry, I had sex with your wife. Or I'm your wife and had sex with the clone you sleep with. Your pick. We had sex. We loved it. Beth Sanchez sure is something, huh? I think I'll ask her to prom. Jerry, for your own sake, stay away from Beth Sanchez. Worst case, she says ""no."" No, Jerry. Worst case she says ""yes."" She's too much woman for you. Yeah, maybe she'd find your simple naiveté endearing, but she's intense. Sooner or later, she'd tear you apart. I'd be lucky to be torn apart by Beth Sanchez. - Aah! - What the f*ck?! Dad's a bug! Dad rolled into a bug! Oh, yeah. Sh... Forgot I installed that. Why does Jerry have a Pill Bug Protocol? It's an emotional defense system. I got drunk with Jerry one night and he said it's what he wanted most in the world. Don't blame me, I wanted tattoos. Anyway, he's in perfect health in there and he can unroll when he chooses to, but can also stay in metabolic hibernation pretty much indefinitely. It's a cool power to have, like if you have to fly coach or if Summer asks you what you thought of ""Wonder Woman 1984."" How do we undo it? Only he can. That's the point. It's total safety. Even I can't reverse it. If you try to pry him out and hit a nerve, he'll literally turn into a Shrek. In his own sad way, he's taken control. This is classic Jerry. He'd rather be a bug than have a conversation. Oh, have you heard the way you start conversations? You ladies discuss responsibility while I get stoned and play video games with your kids. f*ck! More forest! L-Look around! Try heading north. Oh, shit. Wait, what the f*ck? Um, maybe keep heading north? Ew, what the hell? Oh, God, w-what happens in the shadows? Jerry, sweetie, if you can hear me, please unroll. He doesn't want to. It's a little late to worry about what he wants. Jesus, Beth, don't fall for this. This isn't love, it's a tantrum. Yeah, but his tantrum is self-destructive. Yours is destructive. Maybe that's why I'm the one that loves him. He worries. He wants to do right. He's ashamed when he fails. Aren't those things you love about me? You want me to be like him? You want me to propose? Threaten to k*ll myself? No. I love you the way you are. And I did it forever in a video game. But in life, things go wrong. Things stop working. I-I like to fix those things, and when I can't, I'm pretty useless. Like my husband. I don't get it. You're the house wife and I'm the space lady, but you're the one that chewed me up and spit me out. I don't want to just forget about you. Me neither. It's a problem. But we know someone that owes us a solution. Oh, shit, we're out of the forest. We found a clearing. Go check it out! Go check out the clearing! Vampires?! Oh, come on! That's not realistic! Morty, it's obviously set in a world where vampires hunt in clearings. How did you... I'm working with the same information you are! Ow! No more screen time until your homework's done, Dad. - What did that mean? - We refuse to care. Damn. You really came of age this Thanksgiving. How old are we? We've had a million Thanksgivings. Can I explain how irrational this is? Asked the guy that cloned his daughter. Will I ever live that down? No.No. You guys are having me ""Eternal Sunshine"" all the ""Multiplicity"" p*rn scenes from your minds? Yep. Basically. Sounds right. Meanwhile, everyone around you... Your father, your cuckhold husband, your jaded children... Will just happily and silently bear the burden because it's more practical for them than the truth and you don't care because it won't be your problem? Solid repipe, Dad. It's like he has a lifetime of experience as a selfish ass. When this fails and the two of you fall in love again and you attack me for taking part in this, I'm gonna lie and say I tried to talk you out of it for hours. In truth, I don't care. Three, two... Oh, for God's sakes, all of you, grow up. - Jerry! You unrolled! - What the hell?! Ooh, plot twist, Deus Ex Husband a. Oh, don't lobotomize yourselves for my comfort. I may be a man, but I'm also a baby, and babies don't take responsibility for other people's suffering. I should never have said I'd k*ll myself if you left me. It's not true. All I'd do is pack my shit and cry while I look for a job on Starbucks Wi-Fi. And that's what I'm gonna do. So the two of you can get clone lesbian married by a robot and finger yourselves on the moon while laughing in Martian French about my weird little dick! Jerry, wait! Jerry, don't leave angry. Should I float out on a lotus leaf? I have to be twice as confident because my wife cheated on me with herself? It's not even cheating. Oh, you here to help? You suck. You don't even know which one is your real wife. If it's me, have you been cheating with a clone? I'm not the clone, but she has a point. Oh, what a provocative conversation it would've been great to have before the two of you... And I am counting two... Gave each other unfairly expert orgasms while mocking my weird little dick! Jerry, you're the only one who keeps saying ""weird"" and ""little."" Well, you've both seen it! And you've both seen each other, and now you want to tell me all about it, but it's a little late. Oh, my God. You're not mad that it was about you. You're mad that it wasn't. He wanted to permit our love. Okay, it's not ""Handmaid's Tale"" to loop in your husband. I agree, for the record. We made a mistake. Oh, because we should've noticed ourselves losing control and gone to Sex master Jerry and said, ""Oh, pretty please, Jerry, can I make out with myself?"" Yes, you may. Yeah, see. Not so hot when it's aboveboard, home-wreckers. Oh, so we won't enjoy this? Well, hold on, hold on, this is weird. Weird and permitted. Wait, you like this? Who cares what he likes. I do. I might like it. And if she likes it, I permit it. You little pervert. You like a little pervert. I like humiliating a little pervert. I approve. Carry on. I'm freaked out by how hot this is. Am I permitted to do this? Until further notice. I love it. Then it's permitted from now on. Oh, because you like whatever she likes. Because you're a worm. I will allow that assessment. - Pass the salt? - I don't care what you allow. - Damn it! - What do you allow? I allow this. Well, then it's required. I approve the requirement. You get over there. Good idea. Oh, wow. Okay. Uh, Honey? I'm fine if you are. You're never fine, shut up. Okay, but... Whoa! Okay. This is not how I pictured this, but... I have zero complaints so far. Because I know what you want. I do not disagree with that. Can I make a pitch? What if we... Are you serious? Hey, is... is this making fun of me? Well, is that bad? I'll allow it. Jesus Christ, you need to fix the portal g*n, Rick! Morty, you asking makes me want to do it less. Okay, uh, Thanksgiving! L-L-Let's talk about Thanksgiving! Who's thankful for what? Go, Summer, y-you first. Um, I guess I'm thankful, for like, water? Perfect! Wonderful! Morty, w-what about you? f*ck Are you f*cking kidding me? Why? Why? Discovery Channel! Discovery Channel, why?! Okay. Just eat your food. Ea-Ea... Everyone eat the food. Sorry, I'm... Is this? Ooh! Well, bye, kids! I'll keep an eye out for my grand kid in space. Your what? Oh, right. ""Naruto."" Thanks for visiting, Space Beth. Well, seems like we all learned a little lesson this weekend! At least, I know I did. Me, too, Jerry. Me, too. Hello there, Jerry! How can I help you today? Howdy! Yeah, just, uh... Just here to hang! Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. You can't come here by yourself. Why not? It's just me in there! Well, not that this is something you'd do, but sometimes we have Jerries come here and try to touch other Jerries. Oh, no, that's... That's not good. Uh, well, see you later! - Okay. - Thank you. Did you get any of that?

However, she is startled by [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]], who is doing crunches on the floor in the living room. Rick then leaves the room without saying a thing. At breakfast, Rick explains to Beth that what she saw was his \""night person.\"" Rick had purchased a machine called a \""Somnambulator\"" from the Goobie-Joob System, which allows him to program his unconscious body to do things while he sleeps that he doesn't have time to while awake. As a result, he now has washboard abs thanks to Night Rick working out so much. Naturally, the rest of the family want a piece of the action and request to have night versions of themselves. Rick initially refuses, but eventually gives in.  At first, the family is quite content with their night selves, as well as doing chores. Beth learns how to play the trumpet, Summer learns Spanish, Morty joins Rick in his squats and gets his own impressive abs (with the two starting a podcast on the subject) while Jerry becomes pen pals with Night Jerry. However, one day, Jerry tells Rick that he had a request from Night Summer that the day family start rinsing their dishes when using them so that she doesn't have difficulty washing them. Rick reacts angrily, telling the rest of the family that he has no intention of doing that, as the whole point of having night people is to do the shit that the day people don't want to do. The next morning, the Smith family wakes up to find all their dishes have been broken by their night selves in defiance. Rick responds by calling in a favor from a devil-like alien on another planet to make unbreakable plates.  That evening, the Night Family retaliates. Led by Night Summer, they strap Rick down and force him to eat the leftover residue on the plates, making him vomit. They also get rid of all the house's furnishings and hide the Somnambulator to stop Rick from destroying it (as that would destroy the Night Family). Taking this as a declaration of war, Rick creates a suit to keep Summer awake and has her go undercover that night to find the Somnambulator and destroy it. Unfortunately, this fails, as Night Summer takes control just before Summer can do this. Night Rick cuts Day Rick off from all his technology and builds robots to enslave the Day Family.   After days of working as slaves, the family is able to escape with the help of Night Jerry (through his friendship with Day Jerry) and try to make a run for it; however, each time one of them is knocked out or tranquilized by the robots, their night versions take over, leaving the others to try and wake them up. This leads to a car chase as each member of the family is knocked out and woke up several times, adding more chaos and confusion to the situation. Eventually, Night Summer offers Day Rick a truce; they'll let the Day Family go if they promise to rinse their dishes. Day Rick still refuses, so the Night Family takes complete control.  Months later, after going on several expensive vacations and living lives of luxury, the Night Family are completely destitute, realizing that the Day Family were the ones who properly handled the finances. Deciding that being in control isn't worth it anymore, the Night Family destroy the Somnambulator themselves and release the Smith family. Everyone wakes up disorientated, and Rick checks to see what has been going on and discovers the terrible news that the Choco Taco has been discontinued, to everyone's devastation.",""":"""",""query"":{""normalized"":[{""from"":""Night_Family/Transcript"",""to"":""Night Family/Transcript""}],""pages"":{""-1"":{""ns"":0,""title"":""Night Family/Transcript"",""missing"":""""}}}

Best investment I've ever made. Before going to bed, I type a list of shit I want to get done. Then the Somnambulator programs my unconscious body, or ""night person,"" to do it while I sleep. I'm getting so much done. C-Can my night person get me an ab stack like yours, Rick?

Night Summer had Night Rick take away my tech. Had to improvise. There are different levels of cortisol in your bloodstream when you're asleep, so this interface only works off my awake saliva samples... Naghh. There. No one asleep will be able to deactivate the laser cage - until I win. - W-Where's Summer? Never mind her. All of you... [WHISTLES] Get to bed. Ugh! It itches. This whole thing is way uncomfortable. Yeah, that's the idea. The Sleep Deprivation Suit is designed to keep you awake until morning. Uh, aren't they going to be suspicious seeing Night Summer covered in all this Terry Gilliam? They're not gonna question her. She's the leader of the night family for some stupid reason. When the night family activates, just blend in. Make them think you're Night Summer. If you start to nod off, suck on this tube. - What is it? - A cocktail of Mountain Dew and DayQuil. The kids in Southern Europe call it DewQuil. - Smells gross. - It is. Once you find the Somnambulator, use this Deactivator Puck. Stick it on the Somnambulator, and when the puck activates, it'll fry its circuits. [GULPS] Remember... stay awake all night.

Jerry complains about the place giving him diarrhea, although the others point out that it wouldn't have happened if he hadn't eaten the food meant for the animals. The meal over, the family are given their fortune cookies, with Summer pointing out they only comes true when the cookie is eaten first. Although the rest of the family is given generic meaningless ones, Jerry's fortune reads ''\""You will have sex with your mother\"".''  Jerry starts getting paranoid that the fortune might come true, despite the fact he obviously would never have sex with his mother. Beth implores him to ignore it, while Morty and Summer find it hilarious and play various pranks on Jerry (including hiding a stuffed doll made to look like Jerry's mom in his wardrobe which falls on him repeatedly making it look like it's performing fellatio). Jerry's nerves get worse when he mother starts calling him more since he's trying to ignore her and begs Rick to investigate or use science to make it impossible. Rick refuses stating that using science to make something impossible usually ends up making it more possible.   Jerry becomes so paranoid that he tries taping up his genitals and even starts dressing like Morty, since Morty's mom is Beth. Space Beth arrives to pick the family up for the zoo trip, but Rick asks Jerry to stay behind as he's been getting strange readings from Jerry's probability field regarding the fortune. The rest of the family leave, and Rick admits that he made that up the strange readings to get Jerry out of going to the zoo, and admits that as much as he dislikes Jerry he has the right to take this seriously. Turning on his device, Rick is startled to find that Jerry's fortune is registering and decides to run a test by getting two boxes with holes, writing Jerry's mom's name in one and asking him to choose one hole he would stick his penis in. Rick repeats the test several times, sometimes switching the boxes and is worried when Jerry keeps picking the mom box. Rick decides to do something he would never willingly choose to do... go to Panda Express. He reasons that someone is trying to get his attention (mentioning that all the restaurant had to do was get a liquor licence).  Arriving with Jerry and announcing his presence to the backroom staff, he finds himself in a shootout which he is easily able to handle killing most of the employees. However he finds that the Panda Express staff are actually running a meth ring (which obviously Rick doesn't mind due to his aversion to the concept of laws) and have nothing to do with the fortune cookies which they get from the usual distributor. Apologising to the two remaining staff for murdering their colleagues (which they accept, saying it's part of the risk), Rick agrees to not turn them in to the cops in exchange for the truck that delivers the fortune cookies.  Taking the truck to the factory where the fortunes are made, they find them coming from a building which is way too extravagant for a company that makes something that's given away for free. Entering and dodging the retinal scans, they find hundreds of similar trucks and cameras everywhere. Rick changes his clothes to blend in by calling on the Eye of Thundera, then makes Jerry look like an assistant with a transformation sequence lifted from Sailor Moon.

JERRY: Ah! Now, that was some fantastic chow mein. And before you say that sounded r*cist, you can ask the waiter how they say it. It's Panda Express, honey. The waiter's from Portland. All right, who the hell changed my ringtone - to the theme from ""Taxi""? - [BOTH LAUGH] It's a new thing on Taxi Tok. That's a subculture on TikTok of kids who decided the theme from ""Taxi"" slaps. Now you have to play the ""Taxi"" theme for ten people while I film it. I don't have to do shit. That's dumb. It raises awareness for leukemia. So... who else is excited for the zoo tomorrow? Zoos are my favorite kind of non-water park. It's just a shame that they both give you diarrhea. You only get diarrhea at the zoo if you eat the food you're supposed to feed to the animals. SUMMER: Which you've done, twice. They put it in gumball machines. You know, fortune cookies only come true if you eat the cookie first. All right. ""Hard work often pays off""? Lame. ""Family time is time well spent."" Okay, that's not only empty. It's been disproven. Okay, mine says, ""Family time is time well... "" Oh, man, I got the same one? - Boo. - Boo. What's your stupid -century watered-down fortune cookie say, Dad? ""You will have sex with your mother."" ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Fortune cookies aren't legitimate, right? Jerry, are you seriously asking if I think you're gonna have sex with your mom? No, I-I wanted to ask if it's okay with you if I make myself throw up the cookie. If it makes you feel better and you can do it quietly, yes, but don't hand that advice down to Summer. [RETCHING] Ugh! Can't do it. Sleepy Gary ruined my gag reflex, which is frustrating because Sleepy Gary wasn't real. Neither are fortune cookies. Go to sleep, Jerry. I know they're not real. [CHUCKLES] It's just... why is it so specific? And why are three of the numbers a few numbers off from my Mom's birthday?! Can we investigate this, Rick? It's not an X-File, Jerry. You got the world's last interesting fortune. Dad, can you explain to TikTok what's going on with your mom? Summer, no social videoing! What if Mi-Maw sees it? We can't let her know this is a thing that might happen! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Uh, ""might""? - [PHONE BUZZING] - She's calling again. She doesn't usually call this much. Because you don't usually ghost her because you don't usually decide you're at risk of... What if she's calling me to tell me I'm adopted?! Well, yeah, then you should definitely hit that. [LAUGHTER] That's not funny! Jerry, you're making it funny by taking it seriously. And none of us will be laughing if you let this ruin our zoo trip. Rick, can you use science to make it impossible for me to... Jerry, you're insulting science. And as the most powerful [BURPS] man in the universe, if I create technology to prevent a random occurrence, I'll end up making it more possible than random. - [PHONE BUZZING] - [GASPS] - [LAUGHTER] _ - When do we leave for the zoo? One hour. You have one hour to let go of this. I'm already done thinking about it. [LAUGHING] MORTY: Check that out, huh? [LAUGHTER] - [CELLPHONE DINGS] - JERRY: Ah! Ah! No! [GROANS] Aah! Aah! Aah! [LAUGHTER] Let me out! Let me out! [GRUNTING] - You have ten seconds. - I want to go. You know of my love for the zoo! Why are you dressed like Morty? Because Morty's mom is Beth. - I'm not unpacking that. - [HORN HONKS] Okay, if you think I have this much patience for the zoo, on Earth, you're sorely mistaken. Jerry, if you don't come with us, I will be so disappointed. Okay, you guys should probably go on without Jerry. I just took some readings on his probability field, and this fortune has some strange powers - I'm gonna need to investigate. - Really?! - Oh, God, I knew it. - [SIGHS] Okay. - Well, be careful, honey. - Ooh! Bring me back a handful of zebra snacks? A-And please take pictures with my favorite animal, the white tiger! - SUMMER: Because they breed via incest? - Is that true?! [LAUGHTER] - Ah. I knew I was right. - Not even close. I just didn't want to see someone get bullied into going to a zoo. You may be the single dumbest human I've ever met, Jerry, but you still have a right to take whatever you want seriously. Thank you, but if that thing says I'm not gonna do it with my mom, I can go to the zoo. Jerry, this thing measures aberrations in probability waves. I didn't even bother to turn it on because if I did... [WHIRRING, BEEP] - Huh. - What?! Nothing. Don't get weird on me. But, uh, since we're free for the afternoon, you mind doing a quick activity? We're gonna disprove this with efficient brute force. These are two shoeboxes. Both are empty, but I wrote your mother's name on the inside of one. What? God, no! If you think for a second I'm gonna put my... Good. I didn't wanna do this anyway. Fine! Can I just tell you which box I would put my penis in? Saying it seems worse, but okay. All right. I would put my penis in the box on the right. Great. Uh, look in the other direction, and I'm gonna switch up the boxes. This feels really low-tech. Yeah, 'cause we're measuring reality. I would take out my penis and place it in the box on the... right. Again. I would put my penis... Jerry, you don't have to say ""penis"" every time. - Just left or right. - Hey, this was your idea! I didn't think it'd go on this long. Okay, penis. Ugh! Left! - Keep going. - Right. Left. Right. Jerry, are you f*cking peeking? Tell me what's going on! You're scaring me! [WHIRRING, BEEP] Okay, I'm just as likely to shit a balloon as I am to become a dolphin. Those are things that could happen? Jerry, everything is as likely as anything else. [WHIRRING, BEEP] Which is why it's weird that you're at all likely to... To what? To what?! Jerry, has your mother been leaving messages? Three texts. I'm afraid to read them. Read them. She's asking if she can come visit. Why would she want that?! Jerry, I'm gonna tell you something I've never told anyone. We need to go to Panda Express. If these guys wanted my respect, they could've just gotten a liquor license. Now you think this has something to do with you? Jerry, whoever's behind that fortune has, like, god powers. Of course it has something to do with me. What do you think I am in this story, the father-in-law?

How much money can there be in cookies that you get for free? And now we're being retina scanned? Oh, oh, oh! I know! - I've got a theory, Jerry. - Oh, good. This place is run by Cookie Monster. He's really protective about his cookies. C'mon, man. You can't crack a smile? Oh, yeah... you're worried about doing it with your mom. Okay. Fair enough. Whoa! RICK: f*cking cameras everywhere. That cup is a camera. [BURPS] That tree is a camera. Can you disable them? Stealth rule number one... turning off cameras draws more attention than changing outfits. Looks like we need to dress for success. Eye of Thundara, give me suits beyond suits! Jerry, assistant clothing. MAKE-UP! ♪ What the hell was that? Reuseable ""Sailor Moon"" sequence.

This would sound impossible to a layman, but to me it rings inevitable! Holy shit. This is real. - They're controlling fate for profit. - I'm glad you're happy. Now can we blow up the building or something? I don't think that's the best way to take away their power, Jerry. Let's take it in a way that ends with us having it. You mean you having it. - I'll share it. - Then you f*ck my mom. That's not how it works, and I already have. - What?! - Jesus, Jerry, come on. How unfortunate. Use the emergency fortunes!

We've got intruders. And one of them... has an unresolved fortune. - [BEEPING] - _ We need that man's mother. Lot of mothers in the world, ma'am. But only one of them is Mrs.... ugh, God damn it... Smith? So are we going to ignore that you tried to stop b*ll*ts using my body? You have an unresolved fortune. Until you have sex with your mom, you're basically immortal. Do you have any idea how amazing that is? You don't even care about me. You just want fortune cookie power. Okay, Jerry, how 'bout this? If it comes down to it, I promise I'll put a b*llet in her head. - No! - Ah, you're right. The fortune didn't say she'd be alive, did it? - I hate you! - Hate productive things. Hate crawling through a f*cking air vent. Ah, those are those weird hex-headed screws. Do your screwdriver fingers... Aah! Aah! [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ [GRUNTS] ♪ Well, at least we have no idea what's going on. That's a LOCKER-ean. I-It's a species that eats chaos. But it has its digestive disorder. Its stomach is stripping randomness from spacetime and leaving behind super-dense pockets of energy that bend entropy towards definable outcomes. I mean, th-that's how fate works. It's a field, like gravity, but instead of pulling small toward big, it pulls unknown toward known. Ah, so we do know what's going on. We know this... everyone that's had a fortune cookie in the last years has eaten this thing's poop. Fortune cookies are alien poop. These fortunes are so basic.

Oh, I've been tryin' to get people's attention. I'd make fortunes saying, ""You're a-gonna break your leg unless you investigate this cookie company,"" or, ""Please come help me or a virus will shut down the world.""

Over millions of years, we've called many worlds home and helped each one flourish. Imagine our surprise upon returning home to find our species extinct and Earth now in the care of... you guys. When we left, you were basically squirrels. Well, uh, we've come a long way, and we... We've buried a lot more than nuts.

Actually, I can probably help you. See, I'm technically human, but I've come to be more, you know, on your level. We're fine, thank you. Maybe I'm being too indirect. I happen to dabble in multiversal travel, and I could probably zap you guys to an alternate Earth. We used portal travel eons ago, but evolved to a one-universe, one-truth policy as the highest form of existence. Sort of a ""put your own oxygen mask on before helping others"" type of a thing.

If you'd like, we could patch up your little interdimensional rift too. No, leave it. I know how to close that. That's there for a reason. Very canonical. Don't you just want it closed?

That thing had uptight Zen snob germs all over it. So, what, now you're gonna fight them? And prove we're violent and stupid? No. We're gonna find out what they're hiding. Only people who have really f*cked up in the past have to virtue signal this hard. Look at Sean Penn. But, Rick, aren't these feelings, like, what they're talking about? Like, life gets, um... ""programmed for competition by early stages of evolution."" Like, amoebas have to fight amoebas for energy, but once a species can get enough sugar from a machine to give itself diabetes, it's allowed to start thinking beyond conflict. I mean, it's all in their pamphlet. Morty, you're a genius. I clearly mean that in the ' s ironic sense, but this self-fellating zine is a treasure map to every fossilized bone in their skeleton closet. They're gonna call us Laura Dern because we're about to get elbow deep in Dino doo-doo. Get it, Morty? The gloves? - You... You remember the big gloves? - Yeah, no, I get it, Rick. I said ""clever girl"" earlier. You didn't even react. I was angry. Um, I'm looking for a few of my, uh, friends. Hmm. Kinda look like the Skullfeet that used to live on our planet way before us. - They're long gone now. - Really? - They're extinct here, too? - Yeah. We keep their bones in that museum over there. Um, wow. These guys aren't gonna be much help. The leading theory is, the Skullfeet stepped on their own brains so much they straight-up died. Such a shame. Would have loved to hear them sing. - Sing? - Yeah. We figured they used to hold huge outdoor concerts in their land amphitheater. You people are idiots. Hey. We didn't have much to go by. Bones aren't big on conversation. Yeah, neither are you, pal. The majestic Basketsaur. Aren't they incredible? We're even making a series of increasingly terrible movies about cloning them in a theme park. - So what happened to them? - No idea. But we do know they all loved eating communal soup out of the Great Dirt Bowl. Starting to see a pattern here. Breathtaking, aren't they? It's a common misconception that they roamed our planet. The truth is, they rolled. Street-style mostly. Some vert. Lemme guess. There's a very large, deep circular indentation in which these ""Grindasaurs"" used to shred. We think they had a second brain in their butt dedicated to pulling s. Three planets visited by dinosaurs, three apocalyptic meteor impacts. Gi... Gi... Gimme the board. I'm dropping in for data.

Dinosaurs are not secretly evil, and they're not out to cause anybody trouble, but it turns out trouble has a way of following them. Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's showtime. Literally every planet with dinosaurs on it is eventually smashed by a huge space rock that takes out them and most existing life. What? That can't be true. It's all right to be frustrated. Let me explain. Why would k*ll meteors follow dinosaurs? As these reptiles evolved to higher and higher levels of loving vegan godhood, another life-form devolved into an equally selfless, hate-filled species of barely sentient rocks. They hurtle through space and do as much damage as they can to their chosen enemy, which is guess who.
