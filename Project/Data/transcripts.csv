0,1,1,Pilot,"Morty, you got to... come on. You got to come with me. Rick, what's going on? I got a surprise for you, Morty. It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about? I got a surprise for you. Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard. I got a surprise for you, Morty. What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage. Yeah, Rick, it's great. Is this the surprise? Morty, I had to... I had to... I had to... I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb. What?! A bomb?! We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start. T-t-that's absolutely crazy! Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica. Jessica? From my math class? When I drop the bomb... you know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam. And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and so that's the surprise, Morty. No, you can't! Jessica doesn't even know I exist. But but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity. I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not you don't you don't got to worry about me... trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm I'm not that kind of guy, Morty. What are you talking about, Rick? You you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She she she she... she's all for you, Morty. I don't care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You're right. Let's forget the girl all together. She she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways. Arming neutrino bomb. That's it that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel. Get off of me, Morty! I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy. What's gotten into you? I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... What are you, crazy? ...person and just let you blow up the whole world. All right, all right. I'll I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden. We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the road here. Oh, thank God. You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive. It was? Sure. Why not? I don't know. You you know what, mo- Neutrino bomb armed. Um... I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer? Oh, my God. His head is in his food. I'm going to puke. Morty, are you getting sick? I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow. The dog sleeps on it. I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something. Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick. What?! Dad? What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time? Damn it! Jerry! Beth! Oh, my God. My parents are so loud. I want to die. Mm, there is no God, summer. You got to rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later. Okay, with all due respect, Rick... What am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole? Listen, Jerry, I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar. But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue. This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them. Oh, dad. What? For real? All right, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows! Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It's called math. And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in. Two plus two. Jessica. Five plus five. Tenssica. Okay, good. It's time for the quiz. Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room. There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00. Hi, Morty. Whoa! Hi, Jessica. Can I show these to you? Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you. You know what I named these? My little morties. Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird. Do you know what I want you to do with them? Rename them? Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers. Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shit. Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me? Uh, I-I'm just doing my best. Morty! What are you doing to me?! Jessica. Morty! Jessica. Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad. Je-Jessica. Jessica. Not my fault this is happening. Well, well, well. Uh, morning, Frank. ""Morning""? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family's poor? Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it. You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty. And now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich. There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands. Oh, geez, Rick. What'd you do to Frank? It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. It's important. Come on, Morty. I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again. Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on! Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go. Oh, my God. I'm about to walk past Frank Palicky. This is the story we'll be telling our children. Hi, Frank. Aah! Scalpel. Scalpel. Knock, knock. Jerry? My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, ""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"" We're losing him. Okay, he's back. Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason. Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia. Losing him. Stabilized. Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery. Well, yeah, on horses. Excuse me? Okay. Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way. Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home. We're losing him. Hey, Tom. We know when we're losing him. We can hear the beeps! There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go. Oh, geez. Okay. Oh, man, Rick. What is this place? It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about mega seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty. Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing. All right. All right. Calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be holy crap, Morty, run! I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty! Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline. All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now? Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? Look at it just lumbering around. It defies all logic that thing. Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this? You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there? The mega trees? That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them. And that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school. All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an Under underfoot figure. Just take these shoes, Morty. They're special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together. Aah! You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on! I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's secret? I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son. Everything cool in here, Beth? It's fine, Davin. Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse. Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies. Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but... Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having... is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend. Well, maybe you're right. Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon? Horse heart surgeon. Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon? Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now. You know, you got to turn the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze. I'm in a lot of pain, Rick. Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty? Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like hitler, but but even hitler cared about Germany or something. Okay, hold on just a second, Morty. Ooh. Ohh. Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you. Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy? Sure thing, Rick. Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is... I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine... that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. The stuff was all over the place, Morty. Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick. There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left. What?! It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty. Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home? There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid. Uh-oh. When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty. In my butt? Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit. Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that. Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty. And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your a**l cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt. In my butt? Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty. Oh, man. The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months. What? Why didn't you notify us? I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather? Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating? Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school. Summer? What kind of God lets this happen? We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death. And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won't let them. The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only. So, I told him, ""give me the blimfarx,"" you know? This this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency. It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like, that's what we eat on girvonesk. The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only. I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt. That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them. It's gonna be great, Morty. All kinds of science. Okay, next through. Except you. You go over there. Why does he have to go over there? Random check. He's got to go through the new machine. What new machine? It's a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt. Run, Morty! Run! Aah! Red alert! Ohhhhh! Hey! Ohhhhhh. Aah! Don't think about it! Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher. Whoooooo! Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg. You know me I'm just trying to- Aah! I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me. Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to sh**t nobody. They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to sh**t them! They're robots! Aah! My leg is shit off! Glenn's bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children! They're not robots, Rick! It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep sh**ting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here! Holy crap! This is insane! Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here! Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal? Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my my Ferrari's in the shop. Just kidding. You're Morty, right? Yeah. You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass. Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche. What? I'm an angry father, not an improvisor. Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior. No? No takers? You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning. You're beyond our reasoning! Takes one to know one. Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. What what are you guys doing with my stuff? We're moving you... to a nursing home. A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun. Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS... and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas. What does that mean? It's personal. Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all. Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own. What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something? Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes. I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific? Oh, for crying out he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say? I do? Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but... we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard. Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once. Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi. Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't. The square root of pi, Morty. Go! 1.77245385. Whoa! What the hell? Holy crap. He's right. Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics. ""The increment in the internal energy of a system is... equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."" Wow! I'm so smart! But I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me. Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop. No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school. Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be 100% honesty and open, clear communication. Frank Palicky was frozen to death today! No idea what you're talking about. Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family. And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you. You know what? Okay. Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter. Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity. Aw, man. Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor kill, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty. Starting right about now. Ohh, man. Oh, geez! Ohh. I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. 100 years, Rick and Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times."
1,1,2,Lawnmowner Dog,"Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby. ...beautiful putt right there good birdie. That's only the... eighth birdie of the day. What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? Outside? Are you kidding me?! Come on! Oh, my God. What's wrong? Your idiot dog! Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy. Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad! Morty, come on. I need your help tonight. Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you? I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty. Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or... Morty's grounded! Ha-ha! Aw, man! Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry. All right, ruffles... What's his name? Snuffles. Snuffles, shake. Roll over. Go to the bathroom. Holy crap! No way. Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty. That was fantastic, Rick! Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one. W-w-w-what is it? It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about. You talking about ""Inception""? That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make sense. ""Inception"" made sense. You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time. Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework? Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it. Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me. You don't know me! Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice. Next week on ""The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes""... You don't know me! Then let me get to know yo, damn it! Uh-oh! Spoilers! I'm a full season behind. Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird. It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty. Wheat thins. Wheat thins. I'll take two. Oh, I think you've had enough, sir. You don't know me. All right, Morty, time to make our move. Make it bounce. No, you didn't. Oh, jiggle it now. You better stop with that. Allahu akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math! Hey! I said nobody move, buddy! The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you! Take cover, Morty! Ooh! Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math. I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty. But we can't get kill. If you get kill in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty. What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh! Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shit in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine! Now bring me my slippers. Now, be my footstool, snuffles. This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog. Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine. You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what. Oh, my God. He's trying to tell us something. That is so awesome. Aw, he's saying ""I love lasagna"". He's saying ""I love Obama"". So cute! I'm posting this online, like, right now. I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing? Hmm? Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk! Why would I negotiate with you? Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield. Mrs. Pancakes! Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking. Run! Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on! Hey, you don't know me! Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall into a giant vat of lava! Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out! You don't know m- All right, let's go. Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird. Don't judge, Morty. Okay. All right, well... Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up. Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch. Ooh, hey! Ooh, oh! Oh, man. Come and join us. I'm sorry. No, no. Ooh, come here! No, thanks! Ooh, wow! Come over here, baby! No, I'm okay. Whoa! Summer?! Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things? Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of kill the vibe in here. It's Summer! Aw, geez. Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister. Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake! This is disgusting! I'm gonna puke! I can't take it, Rick! Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! Off with their heads! Time to go another dream deep, Morty! What the hell? Why would Mr. goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick? Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me? Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! Oh, here we go! Holy crap! Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives. I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there? Snuffles fix. Make better. Humans understand snuffles now? That... is... awesome! Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood. Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over. Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away. Why not? I don't know. It's Indian giving. A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect kill machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and kill. It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy. Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV. ""A,"" ""b"" his name is scary Terry ""C,"" ""d"" he's very scary Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! ""E,"" ""f"" he'll design your death The little girl! Huh? ""J,"" ""k,"" he'll really ruin your day Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty. Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good. Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch! Ohhhh! Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed! Where are my testicles, Summer? Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone? Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, snuffles. Do not call me that! ""Snuffles"" was my slave name. You shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white. Okay, snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me. Scaring you? Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund? Uhhh... Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here? Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again? No! No, we were... uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to... uh... Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks! Yeah. Totally. Let's go. You will walk when it is time to walk. What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math? Oh, yeah. Buckle up, bitch! Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot! You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding. But that's the opposite of what- Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything? Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick. Worst-case scenario we're back to running. Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking. Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while. You can run... But you can't hide! Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move. Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding. Dad, he wants to be called snowball. Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous. You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery. You think you can control me with a haircut? Hi, honey. You're home early. How was your day? I don't want to talk about it! Oh, of course. You never want to talk about it. Get off my back, bitch! Out there. Not in here. Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa. I love you, too, Terry. Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him. Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare. Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know... scare scary Terry. Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants! Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch? Oh... um... ""Bitch."" Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? Hey, leave him alone! Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants? Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this. You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is. Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants... dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool. Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say. You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg. You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip. Oh, hey, it's you guys! I haven't seen him this relaxed in years. If you guys ever need anything, just say the word. As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with. ""Q,"" ""r,"" you won't get very far I always hated that song! These halves don't belong together, bitch! Sex is sacred! This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch! Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure... I'm giving Morty an ""A"" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought. What the hell? Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty? Oh, man, what's going on? Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty. I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart. This is why I choose to get C's. Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer. Dad! Rick! Oh, thank God, Morty. Oh, you're welcome. All right, let's get out of here. If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it. It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right? Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time. See that? I'm peeing all over your special gun. That means I own them. Bad person. Bad. Ooh, great plan, Jerry. Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side. Th-thanks, snuffles. Begin phase two. Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard. It appears clear at this time... that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end. Please! Please don't kill me! What's she saying, bill? I think she's saying, ""I love lasagna."" Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead! No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon. What? It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream. But I-it's been like a whole year! It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants. No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth. Aw, man, geez! Seriously? Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these. Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down. What?! It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg. It's pretty bad, emperor snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation. Anything. Anything for my precious Morty. Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. You could lose your kingdom. To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness. Do you think they would have done this for us? We are not them! We are not... them. Assemble the troops. I've made a decision. Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory. I'm gonna miss you, snowball. You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much. Jerry? I'm sorry. It's just like the end of ""Old Yeller."" Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it. Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick. I think it will be great, Morty. You know... it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven. You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick. What do you know, Morty? What do you know? Hi, guys. I'm your new teacher for scary class. My name is scary Mr. Johnson. Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear. Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here's what I say... you can't learn anything until you learn... how to chill. Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch."
2,1,3,Anatomy Park,"Mmm. Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham. Um, merry Christmas. Hello? My parents are coming over for the first time in years. Can we stow the gadgets and look alive? Alive? For your parents? Mm, good one. Hey, man! You ""hey, man!"" This holiday is about humanity. You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something. Whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking now. Dad, I'm not giving you my phone. Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook. A-ho, ho, ho, everybody. More like ""whoa, whoa, whoa."" What is this? My parents are coming! Calm down, Jerry. This is Reuben, an old friend. Pearl harbor. I check in on him once a year and give him a little medical evaluation. Aww! Dad, that is so sweet! Yeah, it is. I don't get it. Korea. Don't worry about your Christmas, Jerry. I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise. Huh. You think you know a guy. Okay, there's my parents. Now, remember no TV, no phones, no laptops. We are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday. Hey, hey! Merry Christmas, son. Uh, hi. Can I help you? Jerry, this is Jacob. Didn't you get our text message? No! You must be Jerry. That's a fine-looking apron. Williams-sonoma? I wish! But thank you. So, you're a... friend of the family? Uh, the way we see it, he's a part of the family. Wow. After your father's brush with cancer and losing your Uncle, we looked at life and wondered, how have we spent it, and how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die... a list of fears and questions or a collection of real experiences? Holy crap. Joyce, that's amazing. Then Jacob came into our lives, and... we're learning to live again. All three of us. Cool. Eggnog? Now we are talking! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh? Hi, Joyce. Leonard. Hello, there. Merry Christmas, man. Morty, a moment of your time? He's in bad shape, Morty. Aw, geez, Rick. What'd you do? Gee, thanks, Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I'm sitting here trying to save the guy's life. I need your help. I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's going on. Uh, where where do I find Dr. Bloom? In Reuben. Reuben, Minnesota? Reuben on the table, Morty. Look, I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. Just hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse. What proc- Hey, dad, where's Morty? He's busy. Morty, can you hear me? Head north. Rick, where am I? Depending on my aim, you should be just South of the entrance. Entrance to what? Welcome, Morty. Welcome... to anatomy park! It's a little business venture I've been cooking up on the side with Dr. Bloom an amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead. Oh, my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder falls? Pirates of the pancreas? You got a problem with that last one, Morty? Huh? No, no. I'm just reading 'em out loud in the order that I'm seeing 'em. Okay. All right. If I sounded a little defensive, it's because... pirates of the pancreas was my baby. You know, I got I got a lot of pushback when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, all right? I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty. Proceed to the liver. Arriving at... liver. Ow! Mind the gap. It's really scary in here, Rick. The liver's under maintenance. Reuben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great. Rick! It's a monster! No, no, no. Morty. The only monster here is alco...... holism. That is an animatronic werewolf. Who are you?! Answer me! Where'd you come from? My my my grandpa Rick sent me! Poncho! That's quite enough. Morty, that's Poncho. This is Roger and Annie. And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom. Hey, Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's going on here? I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down, and I'm afraid... the exhibits are unlocked. Exhibits? Anatomy park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the... Pirates of the pancreas. Watch it. It is, first and foremost, a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases. Diseases? Hey, doc. I got news for you. Your living museum is officially a wild safari! Hepatitis A! Run! Oh, the food goes in your mouth, girl. Oh, Jacob. I'm sorry, Jacob. I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you, like, uh are you, like, their caretaker? Is that what it is? We can go into detail later, son. Now, wait. Th-there's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared 40 years of each other, mind, body, and soul, and when minds and souls are joined for eternity and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body and an opportunity to share and experiment. Dad, please. What are you saying? Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard, and we support you. Hey, speak for yourself, because it... sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover. No, no, no, no, no, no. Jacob is your mother's lover. I watch them sometimes... from a chair and sometimes from a closet, almost always dressed as superman. Oh. Jerry, this ham has got to be all you, right? It's incredible. Happy human holiday, dad. Aah! Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system. That's strange. Airflow is down 20%. So, the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security's offline. Well, I guess we better check it out. Hey! Wait for me! Put that back on! If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for a blockage. I'll go. Don't be a hero, kid. I'm not. I'm doing it because it's fun. We shouldn't be here. Whatever you do, do not fire that thing in here. We must save Reuben. This is my life's work. It's all right, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain... a strain of these bacteria, but the scar tissue keeps them... Dormant. Morty, get down! Whoa-ho-ho! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, what are those things? Tuberculosis coming in fast! Not faster than a b*llet! Aah! No! Do you know what you've done?! Whoa! Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing! Whoaaaa! Don't let me die! Just take a deep breath, Reuben. You're not gonna die! What's your name? My name is... Alexand- Rick r-r-Reuben's got tuberculosis! Oh, great work, Morty. Okay, I'll just cure it and then- Okay. Well, I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor and pop by pirates of the pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but I think it's great, Morty. It's a bunch of Pirates running around a Pancreas. We don't whitewash it, either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get, you know, you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible, please, you gotta treat yourself. Oh, man. What is that horrible smell? You mean the panda express? Kidding. I-I'm kidding. The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We're inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy park is doomed. Forget about the park, doctor! How do we get out? The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all. Everybody, head for the colon! Now I'm taking orders from a 12-year-old boy? Morty, the scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eye on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand. Intestines are ahead to the left, then to the right, then left, et cetera. Hey, just so you know, I'm actually 14. So, you know... What? Not 12. Okay. You know, because he just said I was 12. Oh. Good for you. Oof. Ugh. Morty. Strike one. ♪ It's a road of wonder ♪ ♪ a trail of food ♪ ♪ it's a pathway to break up ♪ ♪ the bad and good ♪ ♪ it's a tube that digests ♪ ♪ and then sends out the rest ♪ ♪ it's a small, small ♪ ♪ intestine ♪ It goes on like this for miles.

Doc, didn't you say that the body was filling with gas? Yes. Why? Kid, you're a genius. Are you mad?! Everybody, in here! Hey, gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation? Huh. ♪ Drummer drum drum ♪ ♪ drum drum drum ♪ ♪ drum drum drum drum drum drum ♪ ♪ Christmas drums ♪ Oh, sing it, Summer. ♪ Christmas drums ♪ ♪ being played by a Bo-o-o-y ♪ Oh, I love to hear you sing. Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted. I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad. What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here. Summer! Ethan? What are you doing here? I've been texting you for hours! What the hell?! I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday! Well, did you even consider how that might make me feel?! How you feel?! Why is everything always happening to you?! Summer, do you have a boyfriend? Yeah, do you, Summer? I don't know, Ethan. Do I?! Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man. I should be able to access... the backup generator to get the growth ray online. If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Reuben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery. What the hell is that? The sphincter dam. We built it when Reuben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse load. I've almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle. Poncho? What is this in your backpack? That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho? Everybody, get back! Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me? That's right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I'll take the highest bidder... Al-qaeda, North Korea, Republicans, shriners, balding men that work out, people on the Internet that are only turned on... by cartoons of Japanese teenagers. Anything is better than working for you, you pompous, negligent, iTunes-gift-card-as-a-holiday- bonus-giving mother- Come on! Aah! Get off! You guys! It's gonna burst! Go! Go, go, go! My foot is stuck. No! It's okay! It's okay. Just go. Tell my family I love them. They may be hard to find 'cause my wife... kept her last name and she made the kids take it, too, so, I-I don't know, you can- No! Let me ask you a question, Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man? From Summer being a total bitch! Where's the anger coming from? My brother... took me fishing once... in the bushes... I can't... I can't... He made me feel like a girl! He made me a girl! He didn't make you anything, man. You are who you are. She is who she is. Now, you go to her... brand-new. Come here, right now. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Ethan! I love you! I love you so much. Um... You did it again, cubbie. Come here. No! Stop! I hate this! Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son. Well, then I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame. My name's Reuben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey... Whoopsie. I'll be inside all of you. My story begins during the dot-com crash in the early '90s. You can put your fingers wherever you want. Morty, you want to put it on mute or something? I'm I'm trying to concentrate. Uh... Rick? Not now, Jerry. I've got much, much smaller fish to fry. I wanted to say I'm sorry I ever judged you. Right now, you're my sanest relative. Relative. Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite. Morty, can you get to the left nipple? Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of 'em, Rick. No, Morty, I'm talking about Reuben's left nipple. We need to get to the left nipple! The body is decaying. The arterial transit system is useless. We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system. That's why we call it the bone train. Would you like to ride the bone train, miss? If it'll get us out of here. How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the bone train? Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die! Let's go! Well... I can see you're busy. Merry Christmas, Rick. There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually. Uh, well... No, you're you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on. What the hell is that? E. Coli outbreak. Hurry! Wait, there is an autopilot. Wait! It's okay! Never mind! I wanted to sacrifice myself anyway! They're they're chewing through the doors! We're in the areola, Rick, almost to the nipple, but we're also in a really bad situation! I'm almost there, Morty! Reports from all over the country have been coming in about what appears to be... a giant, naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom? Well, the eyes aren't twinkling and the dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a 70-mile cherry. Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMahan in Los Angeles. We've got feet here on the west coast, Bill, giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size, and you know what they say about that. Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what's going down in the rocky mountains. Wha? Oh my God, the track! It's Hepatitis A! Aaaah! The nipple hole. It's beautiful. Oh, no! Holy crap! Whoa! It's Hepatitis C! Um... wait did we have some sort of relationship with him? I think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys. Oh. Huh. Where's Dr. Bloom? I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead. God damn it, Morty. I ask you to do one thing! Jerry doesn't know what he's missing. He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together. I don't know, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will... It's raining blood! Oh, shit. Find Jerry. Oh, God. Jerry! It's all right. The TV says there's nothing to worry about. The giant, naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine. Oh, yes. Dad, can I have my phone back? A sure, sweetie. Here. Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax. This is nice. Yeah. Look, I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob. No, we didn't, dad. No, we didn't. Too bad about Dr. Bloom. He was a genius the only man capable of creating a new anatomy park. Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create an entirely new, much safer park. What about... Pirates of the pancreas? I think it was one of the most underrated attractions. Boo-yah! Hold your breath. Hey, what the hell, Rick?! What the hell, man! I liked her! I really had something going there, Rick! Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a b*llet, Morty, trust me. Puffy vagina. What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me. I don't know. Come on, let's get some stuffing. I'm starving. Oh, unbelievable. We got we got a bunch of robot, computer people, sitting around with their faces stuffed into computer screens. Do you guys realize that Christ was born today? Jesus Christ, our savior, was born today. Are are are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this? Hey, Rick? Rick, can you hear me? Loud and clear, Annie. Great. We're also on with Alejandro, our chief imaginarian. Hey, Rick. Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter from microscopic marketing, Zack from organ concepts, and Jamie from new media. Hey, everybody. Hi, how's it going? Hi, Rick. So, pirates of the pancreas. Yeah. Talk to me. Hey, Rick. It's Alejandro speaking. Um, so, we asked ourselves, internally we asked ourselves over here, ""okay, what does a pancreas do?"" And the answer was, ""does it make pirates?"" No, it makes Insulin, you know? So, we're starting with a new- Those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park? Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Those people. This whole thing, Ethan. Cool. And who pays me?"

Concentrated dark matter The fuel for accelerated space Travel. Now, do you know how to make it? Morty: Umm... Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a Scientist? Morty: Oh, yeah, but, you Know, he told me that I Shouldn't go around spouting off About, you know, his science and Stuff. I bet you've seen him make Concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, i'll Be your girlfriend. Morty: Uh, y-you will? Seems like a rare Opportunity, Morty. [ blam! ] Rick: Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency. Stop right there!

You know, it's lucky for us They're also really Uncomfortable with nudity. Morty: Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone's just gonna be Insane today, at least let me be Insane with jessica. Rick: I can't [burps] let you Do that, Morty. Morty: Give it to me! Rick: No! [ burps ] You give it to me! Morty: G-g-give it! No, Rick! [ aliens groaning ] Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh. Well, check every five quintons And tell me when they're not. I think we should make kevin Look, sir. What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that? Uh, sir, we have a situation Over here. If there's a wiener on that Monitor, I swear to god, stu... Something is drawing a lot of Processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. There's another real human in The simulator. Jerry: Okay, Jerry big Pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. [ whirrin] You can do this. How did this happen?! Where's the abductions Department? Hey, man, abductions just Follows the acquisition order. Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that Haven'tbeen simulated! Well, simulations doesn't Simulate anybody that's been Abducted, so [chuckles] Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. [ chuckles ] I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. There's still another human in Here! Who is he? Rick's son-in-law, Jerry smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's In a simulation. [ sighs ] Well, cap his sector at 5% Processing, keep his settings on Auto, and we'll deal with him Later. Rick sanchez is the target. Jerry: [ inhales deeply ] Got to relax. It's just a pitch. Got to relax. [ click ] [ static ] This is earth radio. And now, here's...human music. [ repetitive rhythmic beepin] Jerry: Hmm. Human music. I like it. [ beeping continue] [ Rick and Morty panting ] Morty: Rick! Rick: Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your Ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak Freely.

Rick: Oh, really,Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen That somewhere in real life Before? Morty: No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a pop tart Want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the Scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? Rick: You're missing the Point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller Toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like A smaller version of your house? No. Morty: So, why are they doing This? W-what do they want? Rick: Well, that would be Obvious to you, Morty, if you'd Been paying attention. [ siren wails ] [ tires screech ] We got the president of the United states in here! We need 10cc of concentrated Dark matter, stat, or he'll die! Morty: Concentrated dark Matter? They were asking about that in Class. Rick: Yeah, it's a special Fuel I invented to travel Through space faster than Anybody else. These zigerions are always Trying to scam me out of my Secrets, but they made a big Mistake this time, Morty. They dragged youinto this. Now they're gonna pay! Morty: What do you W-w-what are we gonna do? Rick: We'll scam the Scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for Everything they've got.

Just follow my lead. Yo, deejay, drop that beat. [ hip-hop beat plays ] [ cheers and applause ] Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for One of ourfamous rap concerts.

[ squeaking stops ] [ sighs deeply ] [ chuckles ] Oh, my god. That's the best sex i've ever Had in my life. It's...it's...too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud. Morty: Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to? Rick: Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates Like a treadmill, with the Virtual world disappearing Behind us and being rendered in Front of us as we move through It, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to... The edge. Here we go. Morty: Holy crap! Rick: Come on, Morty. Morty: [ grunts ] Sir, they're over the edge. Yes, they are. Just...as...planned. [ evil laughter ] Oh, this is going to be such a Mind [bleep] Rick: Keep your eyes peeled For the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam These idiots. Morty: So, hey, why do these Aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter Than them? Rick: It's an obsession for Them at this point. The zi[burps]gerions have been Trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, i'm one step Ahead of them. Aha! Here we go. Grab as many processors as you Can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, But they're reallygood at Making these chips. Morty: I've got so many, I Can barely hold them all. [ chuckles ] Look at look at this. Oops. I dropped one. Rick: Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you Little goofball. [ both laugh ] Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha! Morty: Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it! [ laughs ] Rick: Nothing wrong with just A little bit of horseplay every Now and then, little fella. [ glass shatters ] Morty: Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy. Rick: Totes malotes, dawg. Morty: Just kind of hard to Believe, you know? Rick: Believe it, Morty. And once again, i'm flying away With everything I can carry, and The zigerions got nothing of Mine. Jerry: [ sighs ] Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a... Minute to talk? [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Look, i'm a fraud. I mean, let's face it ""hungry for apples"" is just a Rip-off of ""got milk?"" It's almost identical. [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: [ sighs ] okay. I deserve that. Umm...i guess...i'll just pack Up my desk. [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: [ crying ] [ sobbing ] oh, my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a Patent on simple rhetorical Questions! There's not even a single word In ""hungry for apples"" that's Shared by ""got milk?"" It's a completely different Slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted! [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Yeah! Wait. Really? [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Yes! I mean, i'm it may be Derivative, but it's the most Successful campaign to come out Of thagency in a long time. [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: I-i'm not saying it Should win an award for Commercials, but it could Certainly be nominatedfor an Award for commercials Specifically about apples, Like...an appley or something. [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Is there really an Award called the appley for Apple-related ad campaigns? [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Could we nominate me? [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Holy crap! [ beeping ] Rick: Get in, Morty. I'm gonna [burps] be able to use These processors to make some Real important science stuff. [ keypad beeping ] Huh. I thought I entered the code Right. [ keypad beeping ] Wha well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're Inside a simulation... Inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom. Sir, the, uh, doctor's Appointment to examine the Discoloration on your butthole Flaps was Too loud, cynthia. Too loud and too specific. Rick: Uhh... [ chuckles ] We've known how to make Concentrated dark matter for a Long time. But now we alsoknow the code to Your fabled safe, Rick sanchez! All your most valuable secrets Will now be ours! Rick: Uh, yeah, until I get Home before you and change the Combination, you bunch of Idiots! That is why you're never Getting home. Get them!

Look, I want to say that today Was the best day of my life... But...the truth is, it's it's More meaningful than that. My man! Jerry: Yes. Thank you, sir. [ sighs deeply ] I...am...finally complete! [ beeping ] My my my my man! Jerry: Aah! What the hell?! [ beeping ] No. Rick: Jerry?! Morty: Dad! Rick: What are you doing Here? W-why are you dressed like a Waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on. Jerry: [ sobbing ] no! [ alarm blaring ] Rick: Ohhhhh! [ beeping ] Jerry: Aah! All: Yes! Yes! Yes! Oof! Rick: Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the Lasers. [ beeping ] [ slurps ] [ gasps ] [ alarm blaring ] Morty: Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick! Rick: I guess they really do Have concentrated dark matter. Morty: Well, you know how to Make it, too, right, Rick? Rick: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, plutonic Quarks, and bottled water. Morty: It's all here, Rick! Rick: Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts plutonic quarks, One part cesium. Morty: Okay. Uh-huh. [ fizzing ] All right. Rick: Now empty the water Bottle into the bucket and pour It all into the fuel t*nk so we Can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time! [ beeping ] Morty: [ stammering ] Rick: Oh, no. Jerry: What the Rick: no! [ laughter ] Oh, my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation... Of a simulation... Inside another giant simulation! [ laughs ] W-we never had the recipe for Concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka! Rick: You simulated my Grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons Of bitches! Kevin fought real hard to Supervise that project. You said you weren't gonna Tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, Am i? Rick: All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now? I don't know. Canyou? Ha! Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his Shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. [ shutter clicks ] Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? [ laughs ] You're not. Or ayou? Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't Have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation. Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that Appointment, then? Yeah! Of course you should! [ chuckles ] No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you Can. Rick: Hey, Jerry, don't worry About it. So what if the most meaningful Day of your life was a Simulation operating at minimum Cap[burps]acity? Jerry: You know what, Rick? Those guys took youfor a ride, Too. You should try having a little Respect for the dummies of the Universe, now that you're one of Us. Rick: Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right. [ aliens cheering ] [ dance music plays ] All right, everybody. Two parts plutonic quarks... One part cesium... [ fizzing ] A-and listen, i'm sorry for Éling earlier. I-i couldn't ask for a better Staff. I love you guys, and I love all Your families. And the final ingredient... Jerry: Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there? Rick: Why don't you ask the Smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. [ burps ] you can't. They blew up. [ sighs ] [ beep ] [ ""baker street"" play] [ vocalizing ] [ vocalizing out of sync ] [ ""baker street"" continues ] Jerry: So... What do you think? You're fired. Jerry: Wha But t-this idea was tested in a State-of-the-art simulation. Well, then, it was a terrible Simulation. Get out. [ door opens, closes ] Man, how does a guy like that go Home and have sex with his wife? Rick: Hey, Morty. Morty: What? Rick: Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right Now? Morty: Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man? Rick: Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little C-character, Morty. Morty: Oh, boy.

4,1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy,"Run! Morty, do it! Hit the button now! I can't do it, Rick! They're my parents and sister! Morty, I already told you it's not your family! They're clones from an alternate reality, possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button, already! Morty, please, I love you, sweetheart. Oh! Good work, Morty. You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable. You okay, Morty? I told you not to trust that tuna. I just kill my family! I don't care what they were. I don't know, Morty. Some people'd pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough. You know what, Rick? That's it! I'm done with these insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I'm out! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on, Morty, don't be like that. The universe is a crazy, chaotic place. You're the one that's crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun. Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah. Yeah, that that that's real easy to say from the sidekick position. But but, uh, how about next time... you be in charge, and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is? Seriously, Rick? You'll you'll let me call the shots? Okay, yeah, fine. But let's make it interesting, Morty. If your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month. Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure! Every 10th. Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going. Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again. Washing dishes? No. The opposite. Can you fix it? Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework? Yeah just don't do it. Grandpa! Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar? Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family. Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk. Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar. Yes, siree! The Meeseeks fulfills the request. All done! Wow! And then it stops existing. Oh, my God, he exploded! Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods. All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win! So many possibilities. My mind is racing. If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! I want to be popular at school! Ooh, okay! Summer, what did I just- Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! I want I want to be a more complete woman! Beth! Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am! You guys are doing it wrong. He said ""simple."" Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game. Ooh, yeah! Can do! Nailed it. God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky? Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay? Can't wait. Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure! Oh, my God, so embarrassing. At last! Two heroes! You must help us! This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures! You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds! Yeah. Beginner's luck. In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Thank you! Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it? Yeah. Gene Vagina. Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- No, I'll get your info from Summer. I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't... I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon. She's still there, Beth. Well, her waistline isn't. Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free. You're saying I should leave Jerry. I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation. More wine? I think I've had enough. Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry. Yeah, yeah. I got it. That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down. Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down? Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax. You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up. I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me. Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck. No, Jerry, I'm the one who sucks! Let me try something. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. Hi! Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing? Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared? Ooh, he's trying! All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next? Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously. Uh-oh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss? Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar. Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word. No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it. I smell the blood of- whoop! Holy crap. Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out. Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying! Hey, look, we get it. You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, ""hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"" Th-th but that's not how it went down! Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that. Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun. Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you. The most important love you can receive is from yourself. Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club! Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?! Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you. Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me! Just try to relax. You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox! Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through. Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry. You're kidding me. Notice anything different? I'm sorry. Hours? Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her! Uhh... Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird. Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty. Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that. We're gonna be okay, Rick. How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then- Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home. W-what the hell is he talking about? They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever. Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it! All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home? Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers. Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash. Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps. Oh, boy, Morty. Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure. What do you say, Morty? I say give me a hand, sidekick. Everybody shut up! Let me try! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I'm going out. Wait. What? Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison? Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is I'll take you to dinner. Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine. I can't take it anymore. I just want to die! We all want to die! We're Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this? 'Cause he roped me into this! Well, him over there, he roped me into this! Well, he roped me into this! Well, what about me? He roped me into this. Well, that one over there roped me into this. Well, he roped me into this. Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps. All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid. Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step. Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun. What are you looking at, mother- Easy, Rick. Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies. Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words? Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs? Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair. I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels. 25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little? That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies. Hi, I'm Mr. booby buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels. It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline. Rats! What a shame. Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out. You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why? Uh, because it's lame? It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here! Whatever. It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution. Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. I fear the worst. Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who's with me?! Follow-through! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! kill him! How are you today? I'm Mr. jelly bean. Hi, Mr. jelly bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure. Nice. Is it a fun adventure? I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails. Isn't that what adventures do? Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow. Yeah. Okay. Uh. B-bye. Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow. Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable. Stop fighting me. Just let this happen. Get off of me! ♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪ Whoo! No! Stop! Please! Stop being such a tease, you sweet little- No! No! Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done. The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game! No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game. Where's he going with this? What's he mean? When we kill him. Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about. Where would you go? I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina. Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut? What the heck? There he is! Run, Jerry! Come on out, Jerry! Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay? Oh, we're well past that, Jerry. Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got? Read 'em and weep, fellas! Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad. Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over. We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire! Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please. Please, I just want to go home. Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh? Really? Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending. Buckle up! Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask... Aah! ...what's your name, ma'am? Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants! Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre? Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you. I'm counting to three, Jerry. What the is going on? He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke! Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game? Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?! Ooh, nice! I think we'll take our food to go. No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer. Fair enough. Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes! Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet. Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place. Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style. Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally. Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry. So... You still thinking about taking that trip? Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to ""complete their task."" Was I one of those guys? The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards. Well... I got you pregnant. Yeah... What the hell happened to this place? Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible. Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot. Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up? Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box. No. No more boxes. What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dubs! Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody. I don't get it. Sir, I think you're going to want to see this. We found it inside a lockbox inside king jelly bean's closet. We have to tell the people. Wait. Destroy it. Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was."
5,1,6,Rick Potion #9,"Principal vagina here don't let the name fool you. I'm very much in charge reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. Hey. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. Morty: [sighs] you don't bring dead babies to passover. Morty: Okay. Here we go. H-hey, Jessica. Uh... what's up, Morty? [Sneezes] What are you doing? Morty: Um... wait, wait. Were you about to talk... to her? Morty: Well... I mean, I was thinking about it. Dude, stay in your league. Look at how hot she is. You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting on their prettiest girl. Gee, thanks, brad. I throw balls far. You want good words? Date a languager. Jerry: Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after brad's out of shape. Morty: [sighing] you're missing the point, dad. I don't want girls. I want Jessica. Jerry: Ah, well, I remember feeling that way about a young lady named ""your mom,"" and that's not an urban diss. Your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her. I thought Rick: ""i should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me."" Jerry: I beg your pardon, Rick inappropriate. Rick: Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school. I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty. His marriage is hanging from a thread. Jerry: My marriage is fine, thank you. Rick: Jerry, it's your house whatever you say it is is how it is but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care, and even inoticed. Morty: Come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that. Rick: Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. [Slurps] Morty: All right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. Jerry: Yeah, I'm just going to... check on your mom. Rick: Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great. Morty: Hey, listen, Rick. Y-y-you know how you said that, you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? Well, I was thinking, you know, w-w could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing? You know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something? Rick: Morty, that's such a poor use of my time. It's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver. Morty: You know what? No, Rick! I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver. I-I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick! I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. W-w-w-w-w-what about me, Rick? W-w-w-w-why can't you just help me out once once for once? Rick: [groans] you're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass. [Clears throat] Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. Do you know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? It's a it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall in love. All right, Morty, I just got to [burps] combine it with some of your dna. Morty: Oh, well, okay. [Zipper opens] Rick: A hair, Morty. I need one of your hairs. This isn't ""game of thrones."" Morty: Ow! Rick: All right, Morty. Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Are you happy now, Morty? Morty: Heck, yeah! Thank you, grandpa Rick. Hey, there's no... dangers or anything, or side effects, right? Rick: W-w-w-what am i, a hack? Go nuts, Morty. It's foolproof. Eh, unless she has the flu. Jerry: Beth, do y-you still love me? Beth: Ugh, what kind of question is that? Jerry: The ""yes or no"" kind? [Laughs nervously] Beth: Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes? Jerry: Yes. Beth: Are you gonna build them? Jerry: No. Beth: Then what good was the ""yes""? Jerry: Wait, i-is loving me the house or the homeless people? Beth: Loving you is work, Jerry hard work, like building a homeless shelter nobody wants to say no to doing it, but some people put the work in. So, what do you say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me? Jerry: Sort of. Beth: Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I? [Cellphone chimes] So stop asking, and maybe I'll love you more. Crap, they need me at the horse hospital. Jerry: Puh! This late? Beth: The racetrack had a starlight derby. There was a seven-horse collision, and davin's there alone. Jerry: [thinking] Davin. Davin.

Morty: [wails] are you okay? Morty: I'm fine! Oh, good. If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself. I love you bad, mo-mo! [All panting] [indistinct shouting] Morty, the principal and I have discussed it, a-a-and we're both insecure enough to agree to a three-way! Rick: I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty. Morty: What the hell is going on, Rick? Rick: What does it look like? T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus. It's gone airborne, Morty. Morty: Oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick? Rick: It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax. I whipped up and antidote. It's based on praying-mantis dna. You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty. I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner. I mean, it's a whole ritual. It's really gruesome and totally opposite. There's no love at all. I-i-i basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus. It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty. It'll all be over very shortly. [Indistinct shouting] Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything, but I'm not interested in having sex with you. These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically. Morty! [All groaning] Rick: Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty. A lot of people don't get that. Jerry: [gasps] [tires screech] Come on. Are you kidding me? Hello! Morty! You're not Morty! Bring us Morty! [gun cocks] Jerry: Nobody's kill me until after I catch my wife with another man. I had sex with billy. But you were already pregnant! Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen? We interrupt ""pregnant baby"" with breaking news. Summer: [groans] Come on. This just in Morty smith's whereabouts are still unknown. Summer: What the hell? The only thing that is known is... how cute he is. I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head. I love him more than you do, harold! You wish, you stupid bitch! Morty's mine! Morty's mine! Meant to be together! [Speaking arabic] Morty! [Speaking arabic] [banging on door] Where is Morty? Summer: [screams] [conversing in native language] Morty: Oh, my god, Rick. The whole world is infected! Rick: Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread. I've really outdone myself. Morty: Outdone yourself?! W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick? This is not okay! Not only do they all want to have sex with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards! Rick: Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. Mantises are they opposite of voles? I mean, obviously, dna's a little more complicated than that. You know what, though, Morty? This right here's gonna do the tRick, baby. It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur. Should add up to normal humanity. Morty: I don't that doesn't make any sense, Rick. How does that add up to normal humanity? Morty: What, Morty, you want me to show you my math? I'm sorry a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid? [Exhales deeply] Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses, but I'm almost sorry we're finished. Beth: Yes, it's satisfying work. Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work. I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world. It's the only time I can really think... and feel. [Slow music plays] Beth: Hmm, uh, what are you doing? I'm playing african dream pop. What do youdo after a long night? [Click] Beth: Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I'd better get going. Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff. Beth... Beth: What is it, davin? Just once, I'd like to know [sneezes] ...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath. Beth: What?! What does Morty's skin smell like? How soft... [grunts] How soft are his privates? Beth: Let go of me, davin! [Glass shatters] [roars] Take me to Morty. Jerry: [grunts] You're not Morty. Jerry: No. I'm mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar. That's... stupid. Jerry: [grunting] Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you. Beth: Jerry! Thank god! Jerry: God? God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth. I'm the one beat them to death. Thank me. Beth: Thank you, Jerry. Thank you. Rick: Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal. Morty: Just do it already. Rick: Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush. I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done. It's fixed. You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit. I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is. I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I mean, soak it in, you know? It's it's pretty neat. It's pretty interesting. Morty: That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever. [Grunts] Rick: W-what do we have here, Morty? Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh? I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh? I-i-i bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty. Morty: Oh, Rick, something's not right. Rick: [sighs] Yeah, you. You're not right ever. Morty: No, no! Look, you idiot! [All screaming] [all speaking native language] [all groaning] [all ululating] Rick: Bet you're loving this, Morty. This must be the best day of your life. You get to be the mayor of I told you town. [Slurps] You're welcome. [Slurps] Jerry: Hold on. Beth: [whimpers] [engine revs, tires squeal] [gun cocks] Jerry: I wish that gun was my penis. Beth: If it were, you could call me ernest hemingway. Jerry: I don't get it, and I don't need to. [Both moaning] Summer: Mom! Dad! Both: Summer! Beth: [sighs] Jerry: Where's Morty? Summer: I don't know. Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this? Jerry: It's not fair to assume that, Summer. Beth: Oh, not fair? Give me a break. He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother. A real man stands by his woman. [Both moaning] Summer: Tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo. Rick: Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't i? We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty. A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though. That's a huge step in the right direction. Morty: Oh, my god! It's a living nightmare! How could you be so irresponsible, Rick? Rick: Me irresponsible?! You all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty! You're the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down and make you up a... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school. I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty? You're gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty. Y-you're a you're you're you're just a little creepy... creep person. Morty: All right, fine. I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum. I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick. But I'll tell you something you know what? You got to accept your part of the blame! I'm not the one who fouled up the serum! I'm not the one who who who who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs! You got to fix this, Rick! Morty: All right, all right, Morty. You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking. Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting. [Birds chirping] Morty: Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time. I mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it y-y-you you you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do. Whoo! That's some great luck. Rick: Come on, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it. I'm great. That's the real reason. Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy? Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis defibulizer? Morty: Sure thing, Rick. Here's a screwdriver. Rick: All right, Morty. Thank you very much. We got one screw turn... and two screw turns... and... all right, Morty, here we are. Morty: Oh, my god, Rick! Is that us?! W-w-w-we're dead! What is going on, Rick? I'm freaking out! Rick: Calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty! Morty: No, I can't deal with this! Rick: Calm yourself, Morty. Morty: I can't deal with this, Rick! Rick: Calm down, Morty. Morty: This can't be real! Rick: You got to calm down, Morty. Morty: W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart! Rick: Shut up and listen to me! It's fine. Everything is fine. There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal. I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time. Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine. We're not skipping a beat, Morty. Now, help me with these bodies. Morty: This is insane. Rick: Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up. Morty: Rick, what about the reality we left behind? Rick: What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is don't think about it. It's not like we can do this every week, anyways. We get three or four more of these, tops. Now, pick up your dead self and come on. Haste makes waste. I-i-i don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome. ♪ look on down from the bridge ♪ ♪ there's still fountains down there ♪ ♪ look on down from the bridge ♪ ♪ it's still raining up here ♪ ♪ everybody seems so far away from me ♪ ♪ everybody just wants to be free ♪ ♪ look away from the sky ♪ ♪ it's no different when you're leaving home ♪ ♪ I can't be the same thing to you now ♪ ♪ I'm just gone ♪ ♪ just gone ♪ ♪ how could I say goodbye? ♪ ♪ how could I say goodbye? ♪ Summer: You know, the thing about a shark... he's got lifeless eyes... black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

Beth: Sometimes. But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, I'm finally happy. Rick: Here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged. We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty. It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world. Morty: Yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know? I mean, i-i wish we hadn't genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around.

6,1,7,Raising Gazorpazorp,"Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator. That is multiphase quantum resonator. Well, does it defraculate? No. Then it's a broken defraculator. Like you would even know dick about fraculation. Your planet just got cellphones and the coverage still sucks! Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur. So lets say 60 smidgens. I tell you what... I'll do you a favor. I throw in a fart. Hey, Rick... You think maybe I could get something from this place? Like a souvenir? Like just to have, like something cool, you know? Not here Morty. We'll stop somewhere else, because you know, there is always another pawn shop. OK, I just... You know, I thought that robot over there, looked pretty cool, you know? Oh, it looks cool, huh? That's why you want it? Yeah, you know? I mean... it's different from the stuff on earth. And you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy and you know, I don't really have anything to... to remember all those trips by. It'd be kind of cool like a souvenir, you know? Like what if you passed away or died or something? I wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did, you know. Okay, 60 for the resonator and my grandson wants the sex robot. So we're just going to pretend this isn't happening? I'm not saying that's a bad idea. Just asking. Rick, why did you let Morty bring that thing into our house? What do you want from me? He thought it looked cool, you know what I mean? Alright, back to... back to... back upstairs. Well, I'm intervening. Intervening with puberty? You'll turn him into Ralph Finnes in Red Dragon. He is at that age, let's just be proud of him. Jesus, did I really set the bar that low? Rick, could you come with me please? Quickly! OK, now if we here squeaking we intervene. Where is the sex robot Morty? That is Gwendoline. I mean the robot. She started beeping, and then transformed and tried to fly away. Strange. That's usually the man's job. You know what I'm talking about, Morty? Morty. That's my catchphrase, remember? Remember how I cemented that catchphrase? Alright, alright seriously though. Let me grab this thing. Come on. Rascal. Okay... unacceptable What is going on? Alright... What is that? I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends. Genetic compiler, incubation chamber. Yeah, this here is some kind of baby maker. And that there is half Morty and half... who knows... what. It's my bad guys I'll take care of it. Hey listen, you guys quarantine the house when Summer brought olives from Mexico. This thing could grow to the size of Delaware. It might eat brains and exhale space AIDS. We gotta be careful. I lost the chance to be careful, Rick. I'm a father now, you know? It's time for me to be responsible. Isn't that right... Don't name it! Morty Jr.? Oh crap, he named it. Well Dad, it's a living thing. And it's half human. And it was born on America's soil which entitles it... Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake. Don't punish us for it. Fine. I'm gonna take this thing into my workshop, and do a little bit of investigating. Do not let that thing out of your sight. It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous. Like the Insane Clown Posse. Yeah, good one, Jerry. 2003 just called and wants its easy target back. He is a like little me. You don't think he'll turn into a monster, do you? They always do. 1995 called, they want... their ""certain year called wanting its blank back"" formula back. Why, Jerry? Why expend the effort? Life is effort, and I'll stop when I die. Out. What you doing? Well, I can't solve... the problem my way thanks to... your family's primitive biological hang ups. Gross. I might have just touched one of Morty's loads. But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr. on this robot homeworld, which is... Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system. Scoot Summer. Don't you need a new companion... now that Morty is in the family way? I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer. Oh right, because there is something about having a wiener... that would make me better walking through a hole? Oh crap. Grandpa Rick! Help! Help! Grandpa Rick! Still think it's a good idea to go through a hole without a wiener? I wanna go home! Yeah, no duh. Great, now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs. You're doing great, Morty. Really you think? I mean I'm not doing much of anything. What do I do if it cries? Then you put it down and let it cry itself out. Yeah, right. We tried that technique on Summer and she is gonna end up stripping. Isn't she? Yes she is. She is gonna strip her attention because she was denied it. Stop filling it with your own insecurity. You're gonna turn it into Mort... more... more... more of you. Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally-ill scientist. What the... Listen to me. I am not rewarding this behavior. Knock it off both of you! Give me him! Give me my baby! You're both nuts. I'm gonna raise Morty Jr. myself. Where is your hands? There's your hands. And that's how we play happy hands. Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty. At least we can agree on that. Thanks, dumb dumb. I said ""thanks, dumb dumb"". Go get more. Summer, put your burqa on! That burqa is a human rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top. Look, I'm trying to repair portal gun with with bunch of sex doll parts and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from cutting you off. The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender. What's the deal with this place? Why is it such a sausage planet and how did such backwards idiots invent robots? Obviously at some point the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines. The resultant lack of distraction and handpecking allowed them to focus entirely on w*r, so they bomb themselves back to the stone age and now they just fight with each other over fake p*ssy with sticks and rocks all day long. You think it's efficient to get rid of women? You ever see a line for the men's room? Are you hea... Do you lis... You hear me, summer? The... plot... thickens. You might wanna cover your eyes, Summer. Yeah, like it was my dream to watch. Summer, grab hold. Grandpa Rick, where are we going? Well obviously Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class. Sound familiar? Ticketmaster. There we go, Summer. Hey brother. Hey bro. Nice racket you got going on here. Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from earth dimension C-137. Don't mean any harm. Coming in peace. It's all cool in the... good in the neighborhood. That was what I was trying... That's what I meant. Oh, I get it. The old ""behind every great man amazon"" twist. Silence! Your slave is ill-mannered. My slave? We assume... you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants. If he is a rogue male, tell us now, and we will kill him. He's my slave. He's my slave. He is definitely my slave. Oh boy, what's the opposite of... Am I right ladies and gentlemen? You guys kidding me. Morty Jr., you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you? You're my special little guy. DA What was that, Morty Jr.? Were you gonna say Dada? Say Dada. Death! Dada. Domination! Dada? Destruction, domination. Nice. The spider in sector C is still alive. Plan your route accordingly and expect delays. We're not telling you what to do. We're just sharing how we feel. And now, weather. Is anyone else cold or is it just me? I am Marsha, ruler of Gazorpazorp. I am here if you need to talk. What is this place? Paradise. We built it during the great passive aggression, when females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk. From here we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population. Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery. The females are placed into educational program where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most. The males... they get to play outside. That was just a baby. And within a day he'll be an adult male Gazorpian, one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe. Wait a minute. We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet. You speak when you're spoken to ding-a-ling. It's true though. One of your babies was born on earth. Are you the ruler of this earth? How did you know? The quality of your top. Do you love it? I love it. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk. If the Gazorpian is male your earth is in grave danger. We will give you passage back home, so it can be terminated. But first, mojitos! We don't have time for mojitos! You are insulting them. I don't care Summer. This place is the worst! I wanna go home! Well, it really doesn't matter what you want because this is a sane place, where women rule. You know what I have to say about that? I can not believe... my ears. Boy, who let the frogs out, huh? Grandpa! Grandpa? That sounds patriarchal. It means father of fathers. Then this one is not your slave and your earth is yet another planet dominated by men. It's not dominated by us, okay? On earth men and women are equals. Equals? We make 70% of your salary for the same job! Seize them! Was this really the time to make that point, Summer? This is for you Daddy. Oh man. Okay. Listen to me Morty Jr. I gotta tell you something very important, okay? kill is bad. Bad. You are silly, Daddy. No, Morty Jr. I'm being serious, okay? You need to put your energy into something else. I mean what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance? I like to dance... on the graves of my enemies. No, Morty Jr.! Daddy, can I go outside? No, absolutely not! But that's where all the people and the animals are. Yeah, but you can't go out there because... The air is poisonous, for you! You will die if... You'll die instantly if you ever leave this house. Do you hear me? For real? For real times a million, buddy. So let's just stay inside... let's try dancing. Right? Look at me. We're gonna dance. Come on. Join, dance with me here. We love to dance. Why do we love to dance? Because I said so! Nice. Nice. So, what are you in for? Because I got a big... you know... penis between my legs. What are you in for? The worst crime a female can commit. Veronica Ann Bennett, I find you guilty of having bad bangs. You ever noticed the ones with bad bangs always have three names? You are hereby sentenced to... the silent treatment! This is gonna be cake. No! Jackie! Rick and Summer of earth. For the crimes of treason against woman kind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist, you are hereby sentenced to... What? A night on the couch? Death. I hate you so much right now. This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness. So we are forced to improvise. We placed a large boulder on that ledge. Holly shit! You're gonna crush us with a boulder?! No! Stop interrupting! The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch... Knives. What?! Just give me a gun, I'll kill myself. Stop interrupting! The knives will... Fine! You were right the first time, okay? The boulder crushes you. I just didn't want to admit you were right. Happy?! Just ignore them. Ignore them. Such an assh*le. Look, I'm sorry, Summer. I feel bad that I let you drag us into this. I wish could have been a better grandpa to you. And you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice cute top, that you're wearing there. Top? My top! My top! The same top you complimented earlier. Look! Look at the tag! Read it! It says... Mark Jacobs. Mark? Jacob? These are names of the penis. Yes. An earth man made this top. Maybe on your planet separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on earth, a certain percentage of males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours. It's true. And sometimes the truth hurts. But it must be accepted. Like if I told you that you're using a wrong color foundation for your skin, and it ends at your neck making you look like a party clown. Okay. Ouch. Noted. But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazorp's laws on earth you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute. Very well. Give the earth people spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet where women are kind of equal, but not really. Good job, Summer, and thanks girls. You girls are really... something, I tell you that. You know, when we first got here I was like... Give them a ship, now. Morty Jr.! Smoking?! That is not okay! What are you gonna do, ground me? I can't go outside anyway! So what? You could do things inside. You could play guitar, you could masturbate... I don't wanna masturbate, I wanna conquer the planet! Oh, here we go again! Who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet Morty Jr.? Love. That's all you care about. What about w*apon? What about domination of the enemy? Alright, that's it, no more History Chanel! This TV is for cartoons and video games only! I hate video games! You take that back! Give it to me! I didn't mean! I didn't mean that! I didn't mean to do that! I'm sorry! I can't take this anymore! I'd rather breath poison than living another minute with you! No! No, no, no! Stop! My life has been a lie! God is dead! The government's lame! Thanksgiving is about kill Indians! Jesus wasn't born on Christmas, they moved the date, it was a pagan holiday! Oh, Dad! Yes, Morty? My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive. Can you help me get him back? I suppose, Morty. I suppose. But first a deep sip from a very tall glass of ""I told you so"". Oh my god, please Dad, come on! Dad, there he is! Oh God. Hey stop that! Oh my god, oh my god, Dad! Morty Jr., no! It's me. It's Dad. It's okay. Put the car down Morty Jr. No! Where's your hands? Where's your hands? My car! ♪ And that's how we play handy hands. ♪ Out of the way, Morty! No! Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creature in the universe. He's my son! And if you hurt him, you have to kill me, Rick! Dad, I'm so confused. I know Morty Jr. I'm sorry. I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me. You know parents are just kids having kids. One minute you like how a shiny robot looks, the next minute you're in a fist fight with your alien son. I'm an alien? We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts. We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive. But I want to murder everyone I see. Well you know, maybe there is a job out there for people that feel that way. Actually, there is. Hi, I'm Brad Anderson. Creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip ""Marmaduke"". You should consider being a creative. I'm hunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilation and sexual as*ault on a nearly daily basis. But you know? I channeled it all into my work. I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke. Well, did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh? Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson. See, you hear that, Morty Jr.? Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind. Maybe? I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel. I mean what I really wanna do is slit people's throat, but, beyond that. I know you can do it, son. I think it's time I get a place of my own. I promise I call you every day I need money or a place to do laundry. So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear Axel? Isn't it interesting Summer, that after all that stuff we just did nothing really mattered, there was no point to it. Kind of makes you wonder, huh? About nothing Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventure? No I'd say given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time, and any epiphanies about gender politics were projection of your feminine insecurity. But hey, why don't you have pink spaceship? Go ride around, and have a jolly old time. Maybe that'll shut you up. Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time? On Gazorpazorp. Where were you? I was reading a newspaper. Oh, that's interesting, Beth. You know it's funny... I heard about a little bit of news, myself. Take a look. Take a listen. This world... still got a... still got a chance! See you guys next week! See everybody next week! Mortimer Smith Jr. New York Times best selling author. Your book is about innocence, the definition of it, and inevitably its impossibility. Is it autobiographical? Certainly. I mean, all writing is, in my opinion. But, my... My father... kept me locked in the house until I was a teenager. And there was violence and... threats of poison gas. But also dancing. But you persevered and created this masterpiece from your suffering. Smith Jr.'s mind-bending novel, ""My Horrible Father"" in every store and on everyone's mind pick it up, we'll be right back. It's a thankless job, Morty. You did the best you could. I hope he's eating enough."
7,1,8,Rixty Minutes,"Cynthia... Oh, my God! No, no... I told you! Hold on... Will you please... Not marry me? I choose Veronica. What? Yes! Called it. Why would he choose Veronica? Because he loves her. Well... if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid. Okay, I've got an idea, Rick. You show us your concept of ""good TV"", and we'll crap all over that. I thought you'd never ask. Hey! Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions. Twenty percent accurate, as usual, Morty. The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality. Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme? How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn. We're not so different. We're both corn of action. Yeah. But one of us is... dead corn! Boring. Summer, you just spent three months, watching a man choose a fake wife. So what? It'd be better if the people were corn? Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look. This shit is delicious. A movie about a guy eating shit. A violent Antiques Show... It's a pleasure to have you. The pleasure's all mine. Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous... Wait! What in the hell? I agree. Where is this going? No, the other thing! Go back! Really? All right, fine. Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore. All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked. Rick and Morty S01E08 ""Rixty Minutes"" Coming up next on ""Shmloo's the Shmloss"", Shmlony has a nightmare. Shmlantha, Schmlona! Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with ""Schmla"". Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan... All right, that got... that actually got old pretty quick. Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman? Infinity's a big number, Jerry. I don't remember the channel. Go back, go back! Jeez... You speak da tru-tru. Oh my God! Dad's in Cloud Atlas! I'm in Cloud Atlas! What's Cloud Atlas? Sometimes small tru-tru different than da big tru-tru. How is this possible? Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities. Including a time line where Jerry's a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Wa... Look at this. And now, another Quick Mystery. I just want to know who could've done something like this. It's a travesty! I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my fingerprints. Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison. Here's another Quick Mystery. My mother's dead! And I kill her. Here's the w*apon. And cuff me, thank you very much. Guilty! Sentenced to murder. Here's another. I'm the kill! Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it? Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions... and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self? I want to obsess about myself. The narcisstic stuff. Here. These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. Go fetch! Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First! I'm proud of you, Morty. Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo! I'm Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics. I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios... I think, I can't... I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything. Our prices I hope aren't too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair! I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson! Everything's black, I can't see a thing! And also I can't feel anything either, did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel. It's a very rare disease. All my... All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know. Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives? You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee. Give me those! What do you see? Whiteness. Pure whiteness. You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you. Whoa... I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp! Haven't we spent enough time on you? I'm performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a human! That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon. I am a real surgeon. Ahh... uh... Summer's turn! Finally! I don't see anything. Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born. That came out wrong. That came out very wrong. Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me. We're playing Yahtzee. Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee. It's a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second? It's a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it's the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D. It's the brand-new... Sneezy XL. The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise. It's polite, it's right, and it's Sneezy... Deezy... Mc... Deluxe. Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy! Achoo! Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it. Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone. It's in theaters now! Coming this summer: Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could... from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came... and that's when things got knocked into 12th gear. A Mexican armada shows up. With w*apon made from to- ... tomatoes. And you better bet your bottom dollar... that these two brothers know how to handle business. In: Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers, Who Are Just Regular Brothers, Running In a van from an Asteroid... and All Sorts of Things... THE MOVIE! Hold on, there's more! Old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come, and cross... attack... these two brothers. But let's get back to the brothers, because they're... they have a strong bond. You don't want to know about it here, but I'll tell you one thing: The moon... it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then? It's two brothers and... and th-they're... It's called... Two brothers... Two brothers! It's just called Two Brothers. Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize. Come on! Time's up! I'm taming a lion! No, wait, uh... there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie. You get the idea. I work with lions. Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee, we're playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know... predictable? When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals. Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night. Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back. Now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables! What are you talking about? All this time, you've been thinking, ""What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?"" Well now you know, you'd be a doctor. Whoop-dee-doo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht, banging Kristen Stewart! You thought about getting an abortion? Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it. So... you're welcome. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy. Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called ""Ball Fondlers"". I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse. I'm in heaven right now. This might be the best day of my life. So now what do we do? That show ""Ball Fondlers"" sounded kind of interesting. Dad! What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not. We'll I'm leaving! You can't leave, you're 17! Yeah, and I'm not pregnant. I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age. I'm gonna... move to the southwest and... I don't know, do something with turquoise. It's Saturday Night Live! Starring... a piece of toast! Two guys, with handle-bar mustaches! A man painted silver who makes robot noises! Gar Manarnar! Three... uh... uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to that one... A hole in the wall, where the men can see it all... and returning, for his 25th consecutive year: Bobby Moynihan! Interesting fun fact, uh, Moynihan and piece of toast hate each other. Apparently they've got some real creative differences. Hey, are you tired of real doors, cluttering up your house, where you open 'em, and they actually go somewhere? And you go in another room? Get on down to ""Real Fake Doors""! That's us. Fill a whole room up with 'em. See? Watch, check this out! Won't open. Won't open. Not this one, not this one. None of 'em open! FakeDoors.com is our website, so check it out for a lot of really great deals on fake doooooooors! Hey, wait a minute, Rick. I thought this was a commercial. What's going on? I mean... Relax, Morty. Don't worry about it... Let's just... just see where this goes. Step on it, we all got places to be! Son of a bitch! See, that must be where he lives... OK. Huh. Making himself a sandwich now... Hey everybody! So this is my house, I just made a sandwich, peanut butter and jelly, still here, still selling fake doors! What? Oh, my God! It's still the commercial! We have fake doors... like you wouldn't believe! What are you worried about? Come get fake doors. Call us up, and order some fake doors today. Don't even hesitate, Don't even worry and don't even... All right, I'm bored. Change it. Wait wait, Rick! Hold on. Even give it a second thought. That's our slogan. See it on the bottom of the screen, below our name. Here's another slogan, right below that one. What are you worried about? Come get fake doors Get in here quick, get out quicker, with an arm of fake doors in you arms. Okay, okay, you can change it. Don't even worry about it... I hate Mumunmunundsdays. And I really could go for some enchiladas. Hey Rick, that's pretty cool! It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield. Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where uh... where those Sex robots came from, remember? That whole thing? Yeah... hey, that's pretty, pretty... that's true. That's right! Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield! Hey Jon, it's me, Gazorpazorpfield. Boy. [BLEEP] you, Jon. You [BLEEP] dumb, stupid, idiot. Come on, Gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, huh? You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white... uh, uh... guilt, white guilt, milquetoast piece of human garbage. Jeez, Gazorpazorpfield, thats, you know... you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake. I don't give a [BLEEP]! I'm Gazorpazorp-[BLEEP]-field, bitch! Now give me my [BLEEP] enchiladas! Hey, Rick, you know, did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray. No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive. Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters. Which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie... Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp... or Garfield, I mean. Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too? I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything? Did you really talk me out of the abortion? Well, we... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic. I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids. And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise. What is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it. So we didn't do the kids any favors. So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves, or... Or? Man. Woman. And now trunk men? We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners. But we don't like the idea of these people getting married. Put a line in the sand everybody--, people! Vote no on proposition XW2. The act that says that gay... uh... trunk people can get married. Who needs it? Not on my watch! Paid for by Michael Dennys and The Denny Singers. Hi, I'm a trunk person. And I want... I-I feel love in my heart, too, just like you. I want to be able to express that love, with both a man and a woman. And I won't be able to... If Denny and The Denny Singers get their way. Hey, let the trunk people have sex and get married, huh? Paid for by... Trunk People. Oh, I love me Strawberry Smiggles! Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets my hands on me, and tries to steal my Strawberry Smiggles. I'm going to eat every last one of them, because... and then they'll be in my stomach, and nobody will ever be able to eat them. Except for me, because they're going to be all inside my stomach. I'm... my name is Mister... Top Hat Jones, and God forbid anyone ever take my sniggy, little pig-dul... smiggles. I'm keeping 'em all for me. Last bite. Oh, now they are all resting comfortably in my stomach. Ooh, am I feeling good. No! Get away from me! Get away from me and my Strawberry Smiggles! No! Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! It hurts! My entrails are out! Why would you even want to eat these? They're soaked with my stomach acid! Oh, Jesus Christ! Lord and savior and spirit! Save me! Take me to the light! Oh, my God, I see Demons! I see demons are coming! Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That's some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial. Well, you know, Morty, I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little. Pedal to the metal, Morty. In a world, where muscular mannies, are coming, and they're coming strong, there's only three... unmuscular... Michaels. Get down! Hurry, run! And that's when real turbulent juice is coming, and you gotta take care of it. With turbulent juice, Turmulent tables. No room is safe from the turbulent power of turbulent juice. What in the hell? Sex sells, Morty. Sex sells what? Was that a movie, or like, does it clean stuff? Hey, Dad. W-w-what's going on? Oh, your mother and I are going to be spending some time apart, Morty. And your sister found out she was an unwanted pregnancy. W-w-w-what? Speaking of ""w-w-what"", Morty... W-w-what should we watch next? What about this? Baby Legs, you're a good detective... but not good enough, because of your baby legs. So I'm partnering you up with Regular Legs. Hey there. Detective, I'm... this is upsetting to me, because I feel like I don't need no regular-leg partner. Baby Legs, don't talk back to me. Good luck you two, there's a criminal to kill. Wow, you sure found this guy quick! Uh, yeah, because I'm a good detective. Look, Baby Legs, it's the criminal! [BLEEP], I'm the kill. I'm running, running real quick... Baby Legs, here we go! That's the sound I make, when I'm trying to run fast. All right, I'm not going to get him. I'm, I-I just learned a real valuable lesson. I'm coming, Baby Legs! I'm... Regular Legs! We got him! Hey, that was good team work. Baby Legs, and Regular Legs, I'm proud of you two for working together, and Baby Legs, I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner. But I'm proud of you that you did it. Hey thanks, chief! Now get the [BLEEP] out of here! Pretty cool, huh, Morty? Oh. Uh, I thought it was cool. I don't give a [BLEEP] what you think, Jerry. Hey, uh... Y-Y-Y-You doin' okay? I-I-I kind of know how you feel, Summer. No, you don't. You're the little brother. You're not the cause of your parents' misery. You're just a symptom of it. Can I show you something? Morty, no offense, but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn't gonna make make me feel like less of an accident. That, out there? That's my grave. Wait, what? On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves, and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast, 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse. So, you're not my brother? I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says, ""Don't run"". Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere... everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV. Mrs. Sullivan always planned to leave everything to her cats. But sometimes, plans need a helping paw. What are the kitties to do, but buckle together and work as a team. Mrs. Sullivan, I, uh... please forgive me for being forward. But your eyes are so beautiful! Wait, this is an actual movie? This fall... sparks will fly! Mrs... Oh... Sullivan... Between one guy, who can't get a break... There's something about you, Mrs. Sullivan. ...and 9 cats who break all the rules. Last Will and Testa-meow: Weekend at Dead Cat Lady's House 2. Well, somebody in Hollywood just lost their job. Written and directed by Jerry Smith. I wrote and directed that? What am I, nuts? Hey Morty, you just missed a preview for your Dad's ""Citizen Kane"". Doesn't matter. Hey, if your, uh, mother and I had to split custody... who would you guys choose? Doesn't matter. Breaking News: Academy Award-winning actor Jerry Smith is leading police on a slow-speed pursuit after suffering an apparent breakdown. Don't even think about it. Come on, Jer- Are you kidding me, Jerry? It's just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap. It's my life, and we're watching it. You did it, Beth. You really nailed it. You're a surgeon. A human surgeon. Yay... you win. Where the hell am I going? What are you asking me for Jerry? I'm sitting here trying to figure out why the cops don't just take you out. They got a clear shit to your head. I can't believe our tax dollars pay for this. Jerry? Jerry Smith? Beth Sanchez, I have been in love with you since high school. I hate acting, I hate cocaine, I hate Kristen Stewart. I wish you hadn't gotten that abortion, and I never stopped thinking about what might've been. Hey, Ball Fondlers? Huh? Ball Fondlers? Yeah, I could go for some Ball Fondlers. Yeah, Ball Fondlers. Ha-ha, Hamster-in-Butt-World Weather is done, and now it's sports time, coming up. Oh, hello there! Good day to you, Miss. So the hamsters live inside the rectums of those people? Yeah, sweetie, that's where they live. Well, how does that work? I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside? Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and walk around on their own? Look, I don't know! I'm watching the same thing you guys are. Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt, and the person wanders off... How would they find their butt person again? I don't know, Summer! I can't even hear the TV! All right, that's it. We're just gonna go there, so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day. Ooh! Family vacation!"
8,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes,"Hey, Rick. I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out? Whatever. Well, I mean, traditionally, science fairs are a father-son thing. Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing. Morty, I think it would be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad. Uh... Yeah, dad. Why don't we do it together? Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son. We'll get out the crayons, brew some coffee, and knock this thing out in two or three days. What is my purpose? Pass the butter. Thank you. Dad, I need a ride to work. Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I'm helping Morty with science. I'm busy. Doing what? Uh, anything else. What is my purpose? You pass butter. Oh, my god. Yeah, welcome to the club, pal. Since when do you have a job? Since last week. It's part-time at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart, eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me. Meow. Can't wait to meet this fascinating character. Please don't. Oh. Well, when did this stop being Jamba Juice? I've just recently opened for business, mister, um, Goldenfold. You know my name? That's disarming. I also know you long for female company. You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can't be filled with Jamba Juice. This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge. One never pays here-- not with money. Nothing to read into there. Thanks! Sorry I'm late, mr. Needful. This is my grandpa, Rick. He was just leaving. Huh. Tell me, Rick, what do you desire? Eh, I make my own stuff. So, what are you-- like, the devil? What? Sorry? I don't know. Store comes out of nowhere, all the shit's old and creepy. Are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun? Grandpa Rick! Hey, I'm not judging. Just like sh**t straight. I'm a man of science. Ah, then perhaps you could make use of this. This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Grandpa, go home and drink. Why don't we do a model of the solar system? That's what my dad did with me when I was your age. Oh, okay. You know, Rick's in his lab, making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science. A man and his boy, making planets. Hey, how about we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto? And then Jupiter -- Uh, actually, I don't think Pluto's a planet. Of course Pluto's a planet, son. I learned that in the third grade. Well, yeah, but you know they changed it. Morty, nobody changed the planets. I just googled it. Pluto's not a planet. They changed it in 2006. Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree. You disagree? That's right. It's possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet. Some committee of fancy assholes disagree. I disagree back. Give me a ping-pong ball. Um, okay. I-I just have to... Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto? No. Geez, I just got to go to the bathroom. Damn. Oh. Okay, good. This is gonna be fun. Hey, Morty, let me ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it? Um... Rhetorical question, Morty. The answer's ""yes, you just have to be a genius"". Cute. Your sister's boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded. Ooh. Oh, boy, Rick. I'm don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know? Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled. I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded. Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick. I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing. Well, that's retarded. What are you guys talking about? Apparently, nothing. You asked him if Pluto's a planet, didn't you? No! It's not. Shut up, Rick. Whoa. I don't care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet, planet, planet. Stay scientific, Jerry. This aftershave made women want me, but it also made me impotent! A price for everything, mr. Goldenfold. A price for everything. Oh, my God! How could I not see this coming?! My lust! My greed! I deserved this! I deserved this! This serum should counteract the negative effects. Holy cats! Ladies, let's get out of here. I haven't learned a thing! Here. You can have this back. You didn't use it? Sure I did -- to develop this. It detects and catalogs all your ""twilight zone"", ""ray bradbury"", ""Friday the 13th"" the series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn't accidentally sell anybody, say... A typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries and then makes the murder happen in real life? Ooh. Be quiet. Don't you want to make sure people know what they're getting? You're not intentionally selling... beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind? I find this all quite preposterous. Oh, I say, good sir. Oh, harrumph. Oh, oh Oh, oh that's beautiful. You know it's gonna be wearing you in three hours? Do I need to call the police? Here, you can use my phone. Don't worry. It won't make you deaf because I'm not a hack. You think you're so great, you stupid piece of shit. Stop! Hey! [Beep] you, man. Stop it right now! Grandpa Rick, I like working here. You work for the devil. So what? ""So what?"" Yes, so what if he's the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he's active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food and make gadgets. Buh-bye. Whoops. I'm sorry, mr. Needful. I'll clean that up. I don't know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but -- It's fine. Summer, you know, your grandfather's right. This store curses people. That's my business. Well, yeah. Fast-food gives people diabetes, and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn't evil? This is my first job. You've been nice to me, mr. Needful. You respect me. Please, call me ""the devil"". I'd rather not, actually. Yes, perhaps not during business hours. I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet. Well, then my son's going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I'm suing you first. I think I know what the ""a"" in NASA stands for. Dad, what's your endgame? Ain't no game, sucka. Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets? It's even easier. Sure, sure, and why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn't always easy, Morty. Whoa! Whoa! What the hell?! I'm king Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto. We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA. I was -- you know, sometimes science is about conviction. I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you. Oh, I... Plutonians. Jerry Smith is a scientist from earth, where he's creating a model of our solar system. Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision. Um... Pluto's a planet. Pluto's a [beep] planet, bitch! Oh, man. This is definitely gonna go to his head. If it's athletic prowess you desire, principle vagina, I might -- I'll take it. But I haven't even -- Thank you very, very much. Great store. Great place. Bye. Huh. Okay. I must say, summer, I thought your grandfather's outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I've had since salem. Nice. ""Wholesome delight"" for lunch? Is that the vegan place? Yeah, I love their soup. I'm kind of soup-ed out. Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire? Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey. Oh, is there a limit? Everything's free, right? Let's just say you don't pay... with money. That was perfect. You pay with the curses, right? Um... I -- well... But, mrs. Tate, why do you want cursed items? Well, I'm going to get the curses removed at ""Curse Purge Plus"". You know, the guy on TV? What? Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but [beep] with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to ""Curse Purge Plus"". I use science to un-curse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers. This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I don't know, $8 million. See you at the olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes. Everything's deductible. Don't pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We're located at First and Main in old town. Come on -- come on down. ""First and..."" That's right across the street from ""Needful Things,"" where you can get evil items for free! Diabolic son of a motherf-- We're back on ""Good morning, Pluto."" And a very good morning it is for our guest, earth scientist Jerry Smith, who's making headlines with his bold announcement that is what, Jerry? Pluto is a planet. Well, how about that. I love it. Morty Smith. I'm Scroopy Noopers. I'm a scientist. Can I show you something? Uh, I better not. Right now. The center of Pluto, mr. Smith, is made of a substance called ""Plutonium"". Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks. There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn't even call it a ""planet"" anymore. Should've been our wake-up call. But the rich Plutonians won't wake up, and they love your dad telling everyone Pluto's a planet because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally... Um, a party? Is everyone in your family an idiot? Well, for sure me and my dad are. Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives. Yeah, you know, the thing is my dad's really insecure. Hmm. Funny. Mr. Needful, out of everything in the store, you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I wish this desk was lighter. I wish this knot was looser. Come on. I don't -- Wait, what am I doing? I wish I knew CPR. 1, 2, 3. Oh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw. Mr. Needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible? I'm the devil. What should I do when I fail -- get myself an ice cream? You haven't failed. People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean, seriously. I may be ""the devil"", but your grandpa is the devil. I just want to go back to hell, where everyone thinks I'm smart and funny. No! It's not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you -- even Rick. I was your only friend, and I get nothing? Okay. I'll give you one thing. Name it. I want to help you. Clever twist. I learned from the best, you old fart. Now, let's go get you hydrated. Looks like we've got... haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936, and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the ""eternity"" and the padding, and then you'll have some time-traveling mittens. Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby. How's business? Here's the last of our inventory. We're going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring. Sounds like code for ""you win, Rick."" That was important to you, wasn't it? Nope. It was important to your dumb devil friend. To me, this was all just a bit, like when bugs bunny [beep] with the opera singer for 20 minutes. He tried to kill himself. Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap. But you know what, grandpa Rick? He's strong, and he's never going to give up. Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care. Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don't care. So? So have fun not caring. I always do. Good. Yeah, it is good. It's the best. I'm sure it is. Bye. Later. I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child. Yeah, uh... Give me a sec. These are the forms for the employee health plan. All right, yeah, put -- put them on my... Eh. I just got bored. Everybody out. All right, just one more rally, then I promise we'll get back to your science project. Dad, Pluto isn't a planet. It's shrinking because of corporations. Yeah, that's what that anti-planet nut job Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion Plutonians are wrong? You said science wasn't easy. I said science isn't always easy. Obviously, that means sometimes it is easy. Let's not debase ourselves with word games, son. Dad, their whole planet is dying. Ha! You called it a planet. Checkmate. What's up, Pluto? Mr. Smith, please tell my friend here what you just told me. Go on. My very eager mother just served us nine pickles, and the ""pickles"" is Pluto. My god, the man's a genius. Um, excuse me. Morty, what? Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto science reader linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes, and surface shrinkage to deep-core Plutonium drilling? Well, son, what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage? I mean, I'm trimming the hedges, and these things are just hanging there. Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them? Good one, dad. Hey, Morty, you want to go on a... Oh. Hey, Beth. Hello? Hey, Jerry, you in here being stupid? Thanks. Hey, you know, I was thinking, you know, I might watch a movie. I am not programmed for friendship. Suit yourself. Hey. Hey. W-w-what's going on? Um, listen, can you help me do the stupid science fair project? Whatever. Jerry, you must be so excited. The Pluto-bel prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive. I'm flattered and humbled. Oh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet. People like that. Your highness, we've captured Scroopy Noopers. You animals! Animals! Ooh, look who's little journey's come to an end. Take him to Pluto-namo bay. You can't kill the truth, father. What? I can see you're confused. Pluto-namo bay is a military prison-- a sort of play on words. Did he call you ""father""? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nut job, is your son? The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf. It's a what? Huh? Oh, planet. ""Pluto is a cold, cold planet"". That's what I meant. Knock them dead out there, you. Pluto is... Not a planet. Ow! It's not a planet. Hey! It's not a planet! I'm an idiot, and I love my son. It was a long six hours, but we've overhauled ""Needful Things"" into the globally-compliant web 4.0, ""e-nomenon"", ""n33dful.com"", spelled with threes instead of ""e""'s. Whoo, yeah! Whoo, excited! Okay, that's it. We just got bought by Google! Mm. I'm so proud of you, Lucius. So, how much did we make? ""We"". This is my business. Security! You're Zuckerberg-ing me? I was Zuckerberg-ing people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped. I'm the devil, bitch! What, what?! Hey! Hey! Hey, Morty. Oh, oh, hey, dad. Um, what -- what are you doing back from Pluto so quick? Uh... Some people just can't handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I'm not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again. Hey, dad. Nobody's smarter than Rick, but nobody else is my dad. You're a genius at that. Wow. That's... humbling and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an eight-planet solar system? Um... I'm just gonna take this thing in and get an ""A"". Butter. But... You're a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you're ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I'm sitting in here, I'm 14 -- I got a computer in here, you know? Oh, I -- I think I understand. You're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man. I get it. Say no more. I mean, one of these days, you know, you're gonna end up seeing something. I got it! Noted. Good night. How's your pretend grandpa doing, aka ""the devil""? He dumped me. Oof. Sorry. Did we learn a lesson here I'm not seeing? Not sure. Maybe in a much bigger way, mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty, and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval? No, that's dumb. Yeah, not satisfying. I'll tell you what, though. If -- if -- if it's satisfaction you're after, I think I might have an idea. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, totally.

9,1,10,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,"So, dad, guess what tomorrow is. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. No. Well, it... might be. It is. Fine. But also, tomorrow is your one-year anniversary back in our lives. I'm gonna make you flying-saucer-shaped pancakes. Oh, t-t-there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine. Oh, my God! Oh, what is happening?! Happy anniversary, dad. Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers. I-I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me. You should be making us a whole restaurant. Nonsense. We couldn't be happier to have you around. I just wish I got to see more of you. Rick Sanchez of earth dimension C-137, you are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the trans-dimensional council of Ricks. Hey! What the heck?! Neutralize the Jerry. Wait! No! I'll -- Dad! Dad! Rick! Everybody, relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just want to haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let's get it over with. Bring his Morty. Oh, man. Leave my Morty out of this. You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to j-- join the council. W-w-w-what about Jerry? Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot? ...Give you anything! I have a rare antique-coin collection! Just don't hurt me! Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. They have little R2-D2s instead of George Washington. Our son's been abducted! You hate me for buying those coins! Geez, Rick, w-what is this place? The citadel of Ricks. It's the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks. Council of Ricks? As you know, Morty, I've got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat -- galactic t*rrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government. Wherever you find people with heads up their asses, someone wants a piece of your grandpa, and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem, so a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo! Answers. Hey! What do you know? It's a cowboy version of me. Geez, you're easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick, and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who's who of who's you and me. Turn your boring, old Morty into a-- hot fashion statement with some Morty dazzlers. Hey, check this out. Show me the Morty. Dumb. Excuse me, sir, is your Morty insured? You know, every year, hundreds of Mortys are injured -- Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place. I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick. Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick. Hey, save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig. [beep] me, pal. [beep] you? No, no, no, no, no. [beep] me. Bring up the holograms. 27 Ricks brutally murder in their own timelines-- an unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic. What say you, earth Rick C-137? You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe? You have a history of non-cooperation with the council. Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick. W-w-w-w-w-why isn't he here in handcuffs? Because he's dead, too! Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile. Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you're the malcontent, the rogue. I'm the Rick, and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government, so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me. Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They're about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste, and I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like Fluffy disks of cake with syrup on top, and I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence! So, as they say in Canada, peace oot! Evidence! Good idea. Scan his portal gun! Oh, come on. Don't look at another man's gun history. We -- we all go to weird places. Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murder occurred. What?! That's Rick-diculous! I'm obviously being set up. Earth Rick C-137, the council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp. Also, every 10 seconds, it stabs your balls. I've heard enough. Run, Morty! Unh-unh. Not you. Aaaah! No! Oh! Oh! Yeah, I'd like to order one large person with extra people, please. White people. No, no, no, no. Black people. And hispanic on half. Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair, please. High chair. No, no, no, no. Recliner. And wheelchair on half. They could have gone into any one of these. Son of a... Oh, geez. Oh, man! We lost 'em. Yeah, I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones, please. Cellphone. No, no, no, no. Rotary. And pay phone on half. That'll keep 'em busy for a while. Those guys were wrong, right? Y-y-y-you-- you wouldn't kill yourself -- yourselves. Of course not, Morty. How could that profit me? But someone out there is kill Ricks, and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me until we clear our names -- by finding the real kill. I'm scared, Rick. Maybe we should go home and stockpile w*apon, like that show ""doomsday preppers"". Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks by now. All right, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is gonna trace his location. You just got to keep him on the phone for 30 seconds or longer. Who wants lemonade? Oh, yeah. Mmm! Oh! Delicious! Beth you're a treasure. I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except you know what? She's not as brilliant or attractive. Aw. Thank you. Oh! She did! She did it! H-hello? Hey, Jerry, it's Rick. Rick! Hey. What's -- what's up? So, listen, the heat's on, and there's nowhere left to turn, so Morty and I are just gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole. What?! Is that cool with you, dawg? Rick, no! Morty!! We got it. The call's coming from... ♪ inside the house ♪ Look at his face! You dummy! Can't believe our daughter married you. Too easy! The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won't be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored, they'll be onto us. Phones à la clams and phonesghetti with phone balls. Anything else? Yeah, more phone sticks, please. Right away, sir. You know, Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought, ""Gee, that kind of devalues our bond"". But then I realized it just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines. Yeah, it's got to be that way. You're a camouflage. Camouflage? What are you talking about, Rick? Ricks have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is to stand near someone with complementary brain waves that make ours invisible. See, when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get canceled out by the, uh... Morty waves. Um... Because o-our personalities are so different? Oh, shit, dawg. My portal gun was hacked remotely, Morty-- obviously by the real kill, to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on. Let's go. Uh-oh. Excuse me. We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion, I'm gonna mark us each with a red ""X"" right now. That way, if someone has a gun and we both tell you to sh**t the other one because they're the evil one, you'll know who's lying. Hey, check it out. Damn it! Hey, you didn't pay your bill! The red ""X""! Red ""X""! Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had lab coats and your favorite kind of shirt in stock, huh, Morty? Yeah, Rick, I-I heard you the first time. You don't have to keep saying it over and over. Man, this place is way off the grid. This guy does not want to be found. Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn't that what Mortys are -- human cloaking devices? Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is. Oh, my God, Rick, look! There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building! Not people, Morty -- Mortys. Oh, God! W-w-why would somebody do this? It's horrible! Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats, but you get -- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put them in agonizing pain, that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks [beep]. I fiddled with a concept like this once. On paper, Morty. On paper. I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric kill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with, like, five Mortys and a jumper cable. Which I also wouldn't do! I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship. Coffee time! Yeah! Yo, yo, yo, yo! That's what I like to hear! Hi, Jerry. Leave me alone. I'm working. Oh, you are? W-w-w-what do you do? I-I'm -- I'm in between advertising jobs. Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy, and then y-y-you help 'em? Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy who really has it all together. Dude, are you -- w-- you're being a dick, right? Oh, gosh, I-I hope not. I wouldn't want to offend you in any way. You're really a Rick? Y-- of course I am -- just as much as my Morty's a Morty. Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie ""mask."" You know, the one with Cher in it? That's right, Jerry! He -- he's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz ""mask"" people. He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty. They assigned him to me because I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I'd love them if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry. Hey, get a load of this. Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick. This is perfect. I'm not doofus Rick! I'm Rick j19-zeta-7! Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right? Hey, I don't eat poop! Y-you guys are always so mean to me. I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry. I'm the worst Rick of them all. According to who -- other versions of you? If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you got to stop listening to yourself. Wow. You really are wise, Jerry. I-I-I guess that's why you work in advertising. The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all. You don't care about me at all! I'm no different than that jacket you've got on! Y-y-y-- o-or your stupid portal gun! I'm just a tool! I-I-I'm just an object! Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now, for the love of God, be quiet. The point of this is to get the drop on the guy. You know what, Rick? I'll tell you something! I'm more than a human shield! Yeah, that's right. You are. You're a perfect, impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty, because you're as dumb as I am smart, which is why when I say ""shut up,"" it's really good advice. Great. Nice work, Morty. Ooh. Look at you, C-137. You -- aren't you a tough customer. The slow clap? Really? Kind of played out, dude. Not in this dimension, it isn't. In fact I invented it. Nobody else has ever even done it here before. Well, la-di-da. Hey, that's mine! I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty. We got to escape. I'm not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you're a monster. Don't be Rick-diculous, Morty. Will you -- will you stop saying that? It's stupid. Take his Morty away. Come with me. Yeah, gladly. Geez, man. Ricks, huh? Hey, man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we could shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys outside? It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick. In here. Ah. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah, yeah. Looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing! That guy got it. Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet. You're missing my symphony. Hey, I'll take it over Mumford & Sons. Zip! This guy is on it! He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That's just a random noise it makes every 10 seconds. You see, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We're not so different, you and I. Yeah, duh! See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers. I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed them out from most evil to least evil. Here's where I am. And look it -- right here's where you are, Rick. This guy right here -- super-weird. I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you're going with this? 'Cause that's where I'd be going. Please. I think I'm doing pretty good on my own. I'm simply gonna download the contents of your brain and then kill you. Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate and just a tad of chlorified tartrate... Ovenless brownies! Mmm. Mmm! It's incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order. Well, come on. I can't take all the credit, Jerry. It was your idea. Come here, Jerry! Hey, uh, come here. I-I want to show you something. Okay, look, everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but you're a genius scientist. What do you think? See? There's little R2-D2s where the George Washingtons should be. You know, Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that these will increase in value or even hold their current value. The truth is, you bought them because you like them. They have value to you. That's what matters. How long are you staying? Until we find your Rick. I found mine. Help! There is no escape, my son. We will find our peace in the next world. So, what -- you're just gonna give up? We're giving in -- to the power of the one true Morty. One day, he will return. Praise the one true Morty. Ugh. All right, Mortys, listen up. My name is Morty Smith, from earth dimension C-137. I know you're scared, because I'm scared. But that's no reason to accept our fate! We're Mortys! We're not defined by our relationships to Rick! Our destiny is our own! This sounds like something the one true Morty might say. I'm sick of being a human shield. I want to be a gardener! I want to write really crazy, intense action novels! I'm more than just a hammer! He is the one true Morty! Hooray! The one true Morty! Hey, keep it down! You've lived quite a life, Rick. It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through. You're crying? Over a Morty? No, I'm just allergic to dipshits. Ugh. Pathetic. We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys. Do your worst, you little bastards! kill me! Do it! Do I-I-I-I-it! Morty! Thank God! Get me out of this. Come on! You're lucky I'm not a Rick. Point taken, but this is no time for arcs. Oh! Yeah, hello. Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common? Huh? W-who is this? I found the real kill, bitch! Get over here! Yo, ding-dong, we're done here. Time to go. Well, Jerry, I guess this means goodbye. W-w-well, does it have to? I mean, you -- you look just like Rick. We could maybe, you know, get rid of him. I'm not saying kill him, necessarily. I -- I'm also not saying necessarily not kill him, but -- Jerry, w-we both know it wouldn't work. It's time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love you. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! W-what -- w-what's gonna happen to all these Mortys? They'll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls. Poor little rickless bastards. Earth Rick C-137, the council apologizes for its false accusation, and in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty in the event that your current Morty should -- Uh, guys, not a good time. Come on, Morty. Let's hit it. Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass. All right, Morty. Don't break an arm jerking yourself off. Man, I can't believe you, Rick. That right there, that w-- that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity, you know? To connect with me a little. Hey, Morty, you want connection, go be part of some stupid club, like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don't connect because I'm the rickest Rick there is. And, you know, it would g-- Go without saying that the rickest Rick would have the Mortyest Morty. It would go without saying, huh? Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it? Nah. The Mortyest Morty. Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster brown. A cocky Morty can lead to some big problems. It can be a real bad thing for everybody. Oh, yeah? How's that? U-uh, I'll explain when you're older. What a mess. Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved. What is that? Hand me the laser difibulator. Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help? No! Go clean the toilets. Maybe you'll make friends with some turds. You make us ashamed to be ourselves! My God. I've seen this technology before. This Rick was being controlled remotely -- puppeteered by somebody else. This is the receiver. Yeah, but where's the transmitter? Wubba dubba dub dub! Oh. Hey, Jerry. What are you doing in my room, buddy? Nothing. I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors. All right. Okay, get out. What's that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh, my God, this is rich! I've got like 10 Ricks to call right now."
10,1,11,Ricksy Business,"Bye, mom! Bye, dad! Drive carefully! Have fun, you two. Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our... Titanic -themed getaway. Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic. Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here. I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage. Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty. Aw, geez, Rick. If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time. That's right. Wait. What? Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song ""blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop"". You guys know that song? From tiny rogerts? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s? No-nobody? A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip. Not one thing out of place. Not a single thing. Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party. I found jello. Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room. Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye. Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said? Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty. Rick, tell summer she can't have a party! Uh, summer, you can't have a party. Because I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! Oh, what?! Rick, you can't! What do you mean you're having a party? Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something? ""Glip glop?"" You're lucky a traflorkian doesn't hear you say that. Is that like their n-word? It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and -- screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids. That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17. Why do you party? To get wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son! Just keep your Sci-Fi friends away from my awesome ones. Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes. After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths. A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink? I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable. Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow! Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read. Do you mind if I skip the whole ""king of the world"" bit? Well, it's not the ""king of the world"" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio. This is where rose says, ""I'm flying, Jack!"" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone. Well, what about her? Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line? I, uh -- I could get into trouble. We won't tell. So... You're a Titanic fanatic? Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate. Happy to help... rose. I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it... Brad! Hey! Yo. Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk. Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool. The beacon was activated. Who is in danger? Ugh! Grandpa! Birdperson! I am pleased there is no emergency. Oh, there's an emergency, all right. A emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers? It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson. Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah. Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson. Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick? Uh... people? Mm, six. Yo! What up, my glip glops?! Oh, man! Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right? Hey, uh, what the hell?! Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party. Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed! Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit. Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?! The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all. Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally. Rick, you got to stop -- Morty! Have you met gearhead? Hey, how's -- Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars. How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly? Uh... Not at all. Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago... Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon? Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed! Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed. Have a little perspective. Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro! Aw! Squanchy! Is there a good place for me to squanch around here? Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg! All right! I like your squanch! Uh, Rick, what exactly is ""squanching""? Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax. Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures! Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later? Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me? For me? Jessica. Knock it off, slow mobius! Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro! I can't believe she's here. Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her. Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood. Oh, Rose. Whee! Is that what I think it is? Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie. It's so romantic. I can't wait to do that with Beth. I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested. Look! Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed. Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed. Uh, sir? There's not a problem. What do you mean there's not a problem? The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg! Well, do something! Steer into it! I'm trying! It's too late. Ladies and gentlemen... Don't brace yourselves. No! No! What happened?! Their rail system must have failed. Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! Totally gonna get laid tonight. I like your feathers. They are designed to attract the attention of the female. It's working. Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate. I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for... I believe birdperson can arrange that. Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while. Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her. Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here. Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party. Everybody should be welcome. Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? I thought everyone was welcome. It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser. Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being. But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! Whoa. What's up, man? I have no quarrel with you, boy. ""Boy""? What's that supposed to mean? It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but... Don't look at me, dude. Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so -- So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?! Well, no, but... You know? What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years? Leave him alone, Brad. Stay out of this, Jessica! Kick his ass, Brad! Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Brad! Rick! I just did you a favor, Morty. Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends. Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet. Jessica, can I show you something? Wow! Look at all this stuff. Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out. It's beautiful. You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you. What's that, Morty? I think that you're the most -- No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there. Oh, my God! Aah! Hey, I'm squanching in here! Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting! Ow! Oh! Oh, crap! Huh. Big star in the sky. Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. We'll be fine! Let's party! ♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now. Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick! Relax, Morty, relax! It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals. Oh, shit, mother [beep]! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here. Okay. Let's go, then. W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something? Yeah. Me too. I should stay. You guys have any aspirin? Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you. Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured. Shut up, Lincoler. It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room. Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too. What? Why -- why me? Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute. Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings. Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken. I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. But -- but -- You see, Jerry? May I show you something? Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater. I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a ""Titanic"" failure. Get it? Ooh! Draw me, Jerry. Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind. But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years. Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. You are gonna draw me. Aah! Then you're going to [beep] me in that car over there. It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time -- Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close. There they are! Wait. Something's not right. Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! Summer's gonna like me again. Lincoler, come on!

He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes. He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died. Well, at least he didn't die in vain.

Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for. Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked. You're so wise. May I assist you with that? Uh, sure, yeah. Thanks. Morty, do you know what ""wubba lubba dub dub"" means? Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase. It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, ""I am in great pain. Please help me."" Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically. No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself. Come on, um... Birdperson. Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge assh*le. Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever. You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me. I'm sick of having adventures with Rick. My people have another saying-- ""gubba nub nub doo rah kah"". It means, ""whatever lets you sleep at night"". Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner. This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy! Caw! Wow. We are so screwed. Rick, wake up. Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop. Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home. Uh, all -- all right. All right. Hold -- hold on. Ahh! So good. Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway. Bring me the thing. What -- what thing? The thing. The thing. The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it.

Why don't you guys go get a free Sunday ice cream? Get out there and get some ice creams. Here's $500 cash in unmarked monies. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and kick it on over to ya. You guys Go nuts. This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket. Sweetie, is your shirt on backwards? [ All gasp ] Yeah. I like it this way. I'm not stupid. Phew! Oh. Man, that guy is the redgren grumbholdt of pretending he knows what's going on. [ Rick and Summer laugh ] Oh, you agree, huh? It's funny. You like that redgren grumbholdt reference? Yeah. Well, guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves. Don't be sheep. [ Dramatic electronic music plays ] [ Electricity crackles ] God, I feel terrible. Yep, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam! Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under... Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. Nuh-uh! Yuh-huh! Actually, sorry, Summer. I got to back the ""m"" bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies. Your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson. Boom! In your face, Summer! You really dropped the ball, man. Shut up, Morty, you vindictive little turd! You shut up, you big female assh*le! [ Warbles ] Hey, don't shove me! I didn't! You didn't what? What's your problem? What's yours? Shut up! You shut up! [ Rumbling ] Wh-whoa, whoa! What the [Echoing] hell, hell, hell, hell, hell? [ Echoing ] Oh, God. Oh, no. What did you guys just do? What did who do? What do you mean? Wait, what am I saying? [ Burps ] Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now? Oh, man, I don't feel good. Am I me? Am I talking right now? I think so. Wait, who said that? All right, both of you just don't move. Don't speak, don't think. I have to check something. What'd you do, Morty? I'm gonna help Grandpa. I'll see if he needs help. What do you mean you're gonna help him? [ Scoffs ] I can help, too. What's happening, Grandpa? What's going on, Rick? Sh-sh-shut up. Oh, crap, are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain! What are you talking about? What's that mean? English, please. English? Our time is fractured... You two somehow created a feedback look of uncertainty that split our reality into two equally possible impossibilities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical. But I thought there were infinite time lines? We're not on any time line, dummy. Look. [ Cat meows ] Oh, my God! Summer: Are those cats? I assume they're schrodinger's cats. Or, actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us. Is the world gone? Is the world gone? Where are mom and Dad? What about mom and Dad? Mom and Dad? Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblmon. Your parents get to exist. They're probably lmng it up in some pointless, grounded story about their [Bleep] marriage. Jerry: Cold stone creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining $20? You realize they sing no matter how much you tip? Whoa! Aaah! Holy [Bleep] What happened? I hit a deer. We... we have to tell the cops you were drmng. What? This is rum raisin! It's still alive. Well, do we... do I, uh, get, uh, a big rock, or...? It's not an armadillo, assh*le. I thought that's what a man's supposed to say. It's not like I could've actually done it. If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I... I think we have to just... It's okay. This is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do? You're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon. So...? Well, don't different animals... Require different levels of kill to keep alive? Oh, God. Get the deer in the car, Jerry. Yes, Beth. This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible. And you did it so we could clean the house after a party? Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like, literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually, everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be ""is."" Or...? We isn't. All right, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time. How do you know... How do you know that... Whatever your asking me, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go. [ Warbling ] Huh, what do you know. It's working. Ow, ow, ow! Oh [Bleep] What the hell is wrong with you two? I-I-I-I mean you four! Both: That hurt! That was painful. Good, I'm glad it was painful. You deserve it. I saw you. Y-you're both [Burps] all over the damn place. We've been split for 20 minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum [Bleep] wind? What the hell do either of you two have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out! Well, you don't exactly make it easy, Rick. You make fun of me all the time... You're always picking on me... And now Summer's doing it... and now you got Summer to kiss your ass. Me?! What about you? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous... Could you get more excited to see me fail? Because you want Grandpa all to yourself! All right, all right, cool it. I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, and you both want to be Grandpa's favorite. I can fix this. Morty, sit here. Summer, you sit here. Now, listen. I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my white board. This has been a long time coming, anyway. [ Tires screech ] Emergency! Wounded deer coming in. [ Air hissing ] Three. Excuse me, you can't be back here. I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake. That's my nurse. And as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs. As a vet, I'm sure you know that a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor. So let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out. It's time to save a life! Geez. [ Grunts, sighs ] That's odd. This deer's wounded. Uh, yeah, I was there. You don't have to rub it in. I mean it's been shit with a gun. Man: My gun. May I help you, sir? No, but you can stop helping this deer. I shit it before these two hit it with their car, and I followed them when they hauled it off. This deer belongs to me. [ Sighs ] We don't have time for this, okay? I need anaesthetic and deer saline. Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting, or euthanizing them, or also when eating them at also any meal. I'm calling my lawyer. I hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter. In your dreams, bitch. Scalpel. So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy, hysterical, bird-brained homunculi. And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don't Go by height or age, I Go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. All right, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All right, perfect. Sit still. [ Burps ] Arms down. I'm gonna do this again. This time be like Grandpa. You mean drunk? What's that? You got something to say? No. And away we Go! And away we Go! Huh, that's weird. Huh, that's weird. [ Button clicking ] Oh, my God. What? Oh, my God. What? The son of a bitch is gonna kill me! What?! The son of a bitch is gonna kill me! What?! Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath. Don't you get it?! Don't you get it?! The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's [Belches] easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. [ Laughs ] I have to admit, it was always in the back of my mind, too. The difference is I would never do it, until now. Rick, what the hell are you doing? Saving our lives! After he takes me out, he's... He's gonna be coming for you. Who? Me! [ gun ] Aah! Whoa! You see that? Get down! I told you, he's a psycho. He's lost it! Th-th-th-the time fracture must have made him crazy! I don't know what to do! Oh, crap! I don't know what to do! [ Rumbling ] [ Device beeps ] Oh, God, now there's three of them. We're outnumbered. Get in the cupboards. Wait, don't... don't do that. They'll know. Wait, wait. Think about getting in the cupboards, but don't really. [ gun ] [ Screams ] Is this what you want, you sick [Bleep]?! You want to see children die?! You son of a bitch. You don't stop lmng until I say so! Michael. Who's this now? My lawyer. I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shit by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies. It's called Brad's law. We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point, you're performing it on venison. Actually, I've decided not to eat it. All this fear and conflict... I'm sure it's ruined the meat. I'm just gonna use the head for my rec-room wall. She normally works on horses. Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the [Bleep] out of here. I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back! Jesus. Shh, shh! I know where you are, you creepy old monster. I know how you think. Oh, is there where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well, maybe you're right. [ Morty grunts ] [ Rick groans ] Summer: Holy [Bleep] now what? Well, if all of me knocked out all the ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized? Right. Okay. So, from now on, whatever we do, we have to be certain. Right. I think I'm certain we're effed in the ""a."" [ Cats meowing, purring ] Oh, God, my head. [ Groans ] What did you guys do? We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy and you caused another time fracture. You tried to kill yourself. O-only in self-defense. Myself tried to kill me first. Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well, actually, I do expect you to understand that. It's basic math. C-can somebody just let me out of here? If I die in a cage, I lose a bet. Well, is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore? Oh, for God's sake. All right, here. Give me the time crystal. Wh-what are you doing? Calling myself. Here, listen. It'll [Burps] probably Go to voicemail since, you know, I'm calling myself. Hello, Rick here. Don't fall for it. It's a bit. Just kidding! Ha, ha! You just got Ricked. You've reached Rick's voicemail. You know what to do. [ Beep ] Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it, too. Take it easy. Whoa, damn! Look at this. I'm blowing up... Three new voicemails. Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard this one. Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Hey, Rick, it's... You get the idea. [ Burps ] W-we're cool now. Okay, well, we're still not gonna let you out of this crate. Fine. I'll just do it myself. If you could get out that whole time, why didn't you? Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds. You know, geez, Rick! Y-y-you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt. Holy! A monster! Hey, you... hey, quit yelling. Quit yelling. What the [Bleep] Your time is all ripped up to hell! [ Warbles ] You broke your time twice. [ Sighs ] How did this happen? [ All speaking indistinctly ] Nevermind. Shut the [Bleep] up. Oh, damn. I'm from the fourth dimension. I can hear all of y'all. Now let's just see what we got here for a second. [ Groans ] Hey, damn it. Were you trying to use this to... Oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standing in it, you dumbass three-dimensional monkey-ass dummies? Oh, way to Go, Rick. Yeah, Grandpa, way to Go. What, you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head. He came here in a bubble. For all we know, he could be the David berkowitz of nutsackland. Shut up. Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y'all are just... Just... just negligent. See, now... Now look right here. Hey, hey, hey, the three of you, put your collars on. We have them on. What are you talking about? Uh, we did. We're not wearing collars. Exactly. 'Cause you're being obstinate. [ Belches ] What? Put the damn collars on if you want to live. They're on right now. We did. They're on. All right, fine. Summer, Morty, put them on. [ Device beeps ] [ Warbling ] Yes, we're back! No more cats! We're back in certain time. Problem solved. No more cats! Oh, you did it! You fixed it. Yeah, I did. Now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak-ass time again. How long, exactly, do we have to wear these things? They're really embarrassing. Well, since you're going to time prison, I'd say you can keep them on forever. Time prison? Yeah. Well, I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way your dumbass assin' ass asses could ever have on is if it was stolen. You stole a time-freezing crystal from testicle monsters?! I would've been happy to pay for it, s... [burps] Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him! No, no, no, no! You better keep back! Man, this will turn your ass into a third-trimester fetus from 30 yards. [ Monitor beeping ] Mm. Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure? That's right, Mrs. Smith. Give in to your anger. Neglect that deer. Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the cervine institute of of elk, moose, deer, and stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border. Where your jurisdiction ends. I guess that's the end of that. There is just one more thing. According to this state's veterinarian statute, this animal can't be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care. You heard the man, horse doctor. You have to say you couldn't hack it. We did it! Uh-huh. No, Mother... no. Earth, dude. No, I'm talking about... Yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you get to the dolphin people, you gone too far. All right, man, I'll talk to you later. Okay. You know what they do to third-dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever. Why are you doing this? You think I want to be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions, man. Bringing you guys in is my ticket up. What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you? You really think I'm that stupid? All right, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Okay, well, then that means there's a 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you. I cannot argue that. [ Thud! ] Aaah! [ Squeals ] Oh, God, gross and weird! Chris! [ Splat! ] You kill my gun! Rick: Summer, Morty, take off your collars. What? What the hell are you doing? Good question. I suppose the answer is I'm not certain. Oh, no, what are you doing? I have no idea. I'm not sure. Stop it! [ Echoing ] Maybe I will, maybe I won't. I'm really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass. List... hey! Tw... ow! But the... these arms are vestigial! [ Grunts ] Now, you poked me where an eye would've been about 6 million years ago. Summer: [ Echoing ] Come on, let's help Grandpa. Morty: [ Echoing ] Yes! I'm 100% not sure about anything! Yeah, totally uncertain. beat his ass! Get him! beat him up! Kick his ass, Rick! Die, Mother[Bleep]! Ow! I'm defeated. What's happening? Time is falling apart. We've got to get back to certainty quick. Give me your collars. Oh, man. Don't you have to fix, like, 30 of them? Morty, I have to fix three of them. And then there's 31 other versions of me that have to also fix three, for a total of 96. I'm not an idiot. I know how to be decisive. Now hand me that flat-head screwdriver. Now hand me that Phillips screwdriver. Actually, make it a flat-head. Actually, make it a Phillips. Oh, shit. Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer. And I know you wanted to be the one to save it. Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego? Well, you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married. [ Car rattles ] Where are we going? One last stop. [ Tires squeal ] Where's the helicopter? There is no helicopter. And there is no cervine institute. But the top deer surgeon... I'm looking at her. Thanks for teeing me up like that. You better get moving. These lights are designed for basic ice-cream work. They're not gonna last all night. I need five minutes. [ beat music plays ] Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had. Thanks to cold stone creamery. You're welcome. Rick: Okay, collars are done. Put them on. We're out of time. It's ironic, huh? [ Beeping ] Huh? Wait a minute. Great. Rick! What's going on? The collar. Oh, the latch is broken. It won't latch closed around my neck. Oh, are you kidding me? Geez, what's going on? How come our collars aren't green? Obviously because someone doesn't know how to put his collar on, and one of me is stuck trying to help him. Don't blame this on me. You're the one that couldn't fix a latch. What are you talking about? It's not broken, Morty. I fixed it. Just put it on. It won't close. It's broken. Fine, bring it here. [ Groans ] Oh! Rick! Morty! [ Screams ] Oh, really, Morty? Well, I'm sorry. I'm not the one who's so [Bleep] uncertain about everything. You know what I'm certain of, Rick? I've really made up my mind about this. I never want to see you again! You're never gonna see anything again, you little dummy! You kill us! God damn it. [ Grunts ] ♪♪ Rick! Oh! Morty, where's your collar? I'll fix it. I dropped it. [ Beeping ] What the hell? What have you done to me, Morty? I'm okay with this. Be good, Morty. Be better than me. Oh [Bleep] the other collar! I'm not okay with this. I am not okay with this! Oh, sweet Jesus, please let me live. Oh, my God, I have to... I've got to fix this thing. Please, God in heaven. Please, God. Oh, lord, hear my prayers. [ Collar beeps ] Yes! [Bleep] You, God! Not today, bitch! Please, God, if there's a hell, please be merciful to me. [ Collar beeps ] Yes, I did it! There is no God! In your face! One dot, mother[Bleep] Yes! Oh, yes! All right, you know what I'm talking about. Oh, that was a close call. Oh, yeah! I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Oh, yeah, do it. Check me out. I'm doing the cabbage patch. Do it right. I'm doing it, too. Do the cabbage patch. It's a classic dance. Do it. Do the dance. Oh [Bleep] look at that. Hey, wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here? I don't know. I think, like, 1/64 of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have 63 other memories of everything. Yeah. But I feel like one of the 64 ricks, like, sacrificed himself for me? Maybe? I think? Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little piece of shit. Beth: Hey, guys, we're home. Together: Mom! Dad! Uh, hold the phone. Where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, lady gaga, table for three. Am I right? Are you guys power rangers, but only on one small part of you necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Cleanup in the fruit aisle. Not in a homophobic way, though. They're just fruity necklaces is what I was saying. I'm gonna pee my pants! Somebody call the planet of ""tron""! Doesn't feel so good, does it? We have three ""tron"" people over here. No, it doesn't. It hurts. Seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles with green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? [ Laughs ] Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the '90s? What is this, a '90s nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie ""the craft"" with fairuza balk? [ Dramatic electronic music plays ] [ Warbling ] Hey, man, when the hell were you? Looking for you, assh*le. I told you past the dinosaurs. You know how much time is past the dinosaurs? Half of all time! Come on, man. It's this way. Come on. Give me that thing. Speed it up. He can't be this far back. No, no, there he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. Stop, stop. So, that's the guy, huh? Yeah, that's him. Hey, man. Remember me? I got something for your ass. [ Grunting ] Don't... mess... with time! You don't [Bleep] with time! Mother[Bleep] [ Warbles ] [ Groans ] [ German accent ] I will mess with time. [ Whimpers ] I will mess with time. [ Shouting ] Man: Did you get any of that? Man: [ Italian accent ] It's a good show."
12,2,2,MortyNight Run,"Rick: Learning to fly this thing, Morty, is gonna be really liberating. You know, you're gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me. Cool. See that planet right there? Don't fly too close to that planet. Someone will come out and try to wash your windshield. [Ringtone plays] Hold on. [Cellphone beeps] Yeah? Yeah, I have it. Where do you want to meet? All right, cool. [Cellphone beeps] All right, Morty, lesson's over. We got some business to attend to a few light minutes south of here. Oh, you still use south in space? Whoa! Jesus, Jerry! What the hell are you doing here?! What are you talking about? We agreed a boy's father should be present when he's learning to drive. I guess I remember that. Wow. And you've just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well, we don't have time to take him to earth, Morty. Head for 3924917. Cool! [Laughs] Looks like I'm coming along for an adventure! Yep. [Sighs] This is where we're going? Nope. This is. You can park in a handicap spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here. Well, look at this fella. Aren't you handsome? Thank you. [Chuckles] I'm Jerry. Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship? I'm traveling with my son and father-in-law. W-wait. Are they coming? Oh, they'll be back soon. What?! I don't know how this works! Help me! What the hell?! I know, right? Oh, what the hell?! I know, right? Morty: Jerryboree!? You created a day care for my dad? Are you kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well, I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy's rich. Don't forget to check the reason for your drop-off. Trust me, Morty, I've heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don't tend to last five minutes off of earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here, they can romp and play with other Jerrys. He couldn't be safer. Hey, Morty, hang on to this. That number's your dad. If you lose it, we're not gonna be able to get him back. ♪ [Electricity crackles] ♪ Okay, wait here. I want to come with. Don't come with. It's boring. It's [Belches]... it's business stuff. What kind of business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady. Right, yeah, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street, Morty? Y-you know what those guys do in their fancy boardrooms? They take their balls and they dip them in cocaine and wipe them all over each other. You know, grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public, because grandpa isn't shady. Aw, crap. Hey, what's up? Hey, Rick! [Laughs] Here you go 3,000 flerbos. Do you have the w*apon? C-can we please? This is my grandson, Morty. Oh, hi, Morty. I'm Krombopulos Michael. I'm an assassin. I buy gun from your grandpa. [Groans] Here. Go away. Ooh! Yeah, this looks deadly. So, this sh**t antimatter? My target can't be kill with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty. Listen, if you ever need anybody murder, please give me a call. I'm very discreet. You're g-giving him a card?! I have no code of ethics. I will kill anyone, anywhere children, animals, old people doesn't matter. I just love kill. You sell w*apon to kill for money? [Groans] You've got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mind-set, Morty. It's more complicated out here. These are flerbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with 3,000 of these? Uh, what? An entire afternoon at Blips and Chitz! Oh, this place is the best. It's got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is. You sold a gun to a murder so you could play video games?! Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad, Morty. Here, check this out. [Coin drops] [Whoosh!] Aah! [Breathing heavily] Roy, what's wrong? I had a nightmare. I was with an old man. He put a helmet on me. It's just a fever. Get some sleep. I don't want you missing school on Monday. [Bell rings] Man: I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future. Now is the time in your life when anything is possible. Announcer: Spiraling perfectly! It's gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20! Now he's at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy ""the Rocket""! Touchdown! [Cheers and applause] I just think it's time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy? [Sighs] [Cellphone rings] Had we caught it sooner well, hindsight is 20/20, Roy. What's important is that we move quickly. [Monitor beeps] [Weakly] I'm not ready to die. You're not going to. Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy. Man: Hey, Roy, you pulled those persian off-white shags for the clearance sale? Whoa. Sh shit! [Bones crack] Oh! [Beeping] Whoa! What the hell?! W-w-where am I?! What in the hell?! 55 years. Not bad, Morty. You kind of wasted your 30s, though, with that whole bird-watching phase. Where's my wife?! Morty, you were just playing a game. It's called ""Roy"". Snap out of it. Come on. I'm Morty. You're Rick. Hey! You sold a gun to a guy that kill people! Look at this you beat cancer, and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo! D-don't dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hit man is the same as pulling the trigger! It's also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there's not a lot anyone can do to stop him. That's why he does it for a living. Now excuse me. It's time to thrash your ""Roy"" score. You know, you could stop this kill from happening, Rick! You know, you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted. Uh-huh, yeah, that's the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store. Holy shit! This guy's taking Roy off the grid! [All gasp] This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy! [All murmuring] Hi. I'm sorry. I think there was a misunderstanding.

The smith family is going to paris! Summer: Yeah! Awesome! Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash! Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry, but life is made of little concessions. I -- you know what? You're gonna land on your feet, jer. Some company out there's gonna thank their lucky stars they hired my little brother. Who the [bleep] are you? My goofy brother, Steve. ( chuckles ) he's been living here almost a year now. Are you losing your mind? Hey, someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks. Am I right? ( laughter ) ( screaming ) Oh, my god! Call an ambulance! Jerry: Oh, god! Steve! What the hell, Rick?! What the hell?! Will everybody just relax for a second? There's no such thing as an ""uncle Steve."" That is an alien parasite. ( screeches ) ( both gasp ) But I've known him my whole life. No, you haven't, Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories, and th-then they use those to multiply and spread out, take over planets. It's -- it's disgusting. Steve wasn't real? He's a real piece of [bleep] This is a big one. Somebody probably tracked it in last week on the bottom of their shoe on a piece of alien fruit. Someone? Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet. But uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike! No, ""Steve"" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things.

Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together. Y-- remember that? After ""the hulk"" musical? ( grunting ) ( muzak playing ) Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong. I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did. Why couldn't I bring my portal gun? ( winces ) Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the hulk. I just got that. Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck.

( laughter ) It's true. We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. L-let's get some fresh air. Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things. I hear you, Morty. Back in brooklyn, we got a sayin' -- ""we're walkin' here!"" ( laughter ) Nicky, get -- Oh! ( gasps ) ( groaning ) what the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?! Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real. But how did you know it was Nicky? I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder. So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old n*zi submarine. Did that not even happen? Well, of course it happened. Now that I possess the mighty staff of rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the fourth reich! This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick. Hey, we got a word for n*zi back in brooklyn, pal. I'm comfortable being called a n*zi.

After due consideration, I have elected not to retire. all: Yeah! Oh, thank god! Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend. Set a course for Morty's high school. Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler. ( chuckles ) dare to dream. Wait. And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble. ( laughter ) no! Don't flashback! You're just gonna make more swelling. Don't worry, Jerry. Just relax. We called the fire department. You know they won't come here anymore. ( grunting ) ( all gasp ) Syeerahve!d. Is yeah! Yeah! Yeah! ( Jerry laughs ) Oh, whee! I guess I take back what I said about british cuisine. ( laughter ) ( laughter ) Take that, Summer! We're trying to sleep. I don't want to go to the dance alone. Then perhaps you shouldn't. Aww. Mr. Beauregard. Shall we, master Morty? We shall. Oh, wait, don't leave without letting photography raptor take a picture. ( raptor screeches ) ( camera shutter clicks ) ( laughter ) Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house. But there's always been 10. No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites. You sure about that, Rick? Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number. All right, there's six of us. ( belches ) and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, sleepy gary, photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer. Uh, dad, that's like 10 people. 6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at? Here, Rick! Use me! Oh, thanks, pencilvester! Yeah, I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that. Everybody makes mistakes, Rick. Why do you think I have one of these? ( laughter, camera shutter clicks ) That's it. Photos. Hard evidence. You're not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole. Well, what do you know about this? You're not in any of mine. All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school. What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family?

Tinkles is real. That means so am I. Sorry, Summer. Man, I'm sorry, Summer. I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one. Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't. I know who the smiths are. I've known Beth since high school. And her husband, sleepy gary, is hands down my absolute best friend. Thanks, Jerry. Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off. Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. Aah! Grandpa Rick! Hold still, ""Summer."" Rick, that is my daughter. Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, sleepy gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you. Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with. Have you forgotten the barbecue? Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you? Rick. You love those barbecues, Rick. You love them. Hai! Remember it, Rick? Shut up, hamurai! Shut up, amish cyborg! What is this?

I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor. What do you say we take down these blast shields? all: Yeah. I can't do that, sleepy gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. ( grunts ) But, Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff. You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from walmart. They're selling nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition ""zelda"" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff. Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that. Don't overreact, Rick. Sleepy gary, a word? Sure, Jerry. Rick, keep a level head, okay? 'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein -- He's actually Frankenstein's monster. Sleepy gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then... Jerry, just say it. Sleepy gary, how do we know I'm real? Jesus, Jerry. No, you're real. Hey, look at me. Now, I don't know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you're real, Jerry. Remember our vacation? They're filming that new ""star wars"" movie down the coast. Should we check it out? Sure. Why not? Maybe we'll see Chewbacca. I'd like that. ( moaning ) What are we doing? I don't give a damn what else happens out there. You and I are going to survive this. Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house. That's a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out? Uh, no thank -- ( grunts ) Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here? Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam. So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein? Shi-i-i-i-t. I'mma bust a -- ( grunts ) No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein! ( indistinct shouting ) Give it back! Yeah! ( applause ) Frankenstein! ( breathing heavily ) Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?! Reverse giraffe: maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real. You know me. I'm reverse giraffe. I have a short neck and legs. I went to college with hamurai. Hai! I saved ghost in a jar's life in vietnam. Boo rah! And, Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on? ( sighs ) too many. Okay, so maybe we're just all fake. That don't make no sense! Or maybe there's only one deceiver here -- The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other. Hey, don't blame me! I tried to sh**t Summer 10 minutes ago! I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years?

( laughs ) yeah! Say that all the time. ( all muttering ) That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there. Yeah, don't forget his incredibly vague back story. Beth, I'm your father! Oh, are you, dad? Are you? Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here! Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old jewish comedy writer's name? Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! woman: In your face! Give me the gun. I'm not doing this in front of pencilvester.

Do it, mother[bleep] Pull the [bleep] trigger! ( screeches ) Oh, wow. Baby wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife. ( screeches ) What the hell? I figured it out, Rick!

We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. ( grunts ) ( screaming ) Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining. We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about mrs. Refrigerator? I-I-I-I -- everyone has bad memories of me. You remember that one time? ( screaming ) Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming. Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, mrs. Refrigerator. They're thrilling. And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life. The jig is up! ( whimpering ) get me out of here. Get me out of here! Aah! ( screeching ) ( all gasping ) Oh [bleep] Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. So what about Summer? Why am I always your go-to?

We're decrypting it now. Head: We asked them to show us what they got, and they did. Now we'll see which of them has got the most. 24 hours, 5 planets, 5 songs. But in the end, there can only be one... Planet music! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray.

We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a m*ssile at every one of those heads in the sky. Our planet's held captive on a live game show, and your solution is to sh**t the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, general. Until then, I'll put mine in Rick and Morty. ""Get Schwifty"" was a jam. Hello? Yes, sir, yeah. Eh, thank you, sir. Thank you. He says he's proud of what we're doing and hopes we have a great ascension festival! Happy ascension! All: Happy ascension! We should pack up and leave town now.

Yeah, sure. Wait. What? I love you guys. You gave me life. And it's the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents. Dinner sounds nice. Pardon, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

[Keypad beeps] I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff. You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery. It's society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power. That just sounds like slavery with extra steps. Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college. Anchor: It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano. But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let's find out. You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes. Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing. Now slap on these antennae. These people need to think we're aliens. What? Why? Obviously [burps] you really [burps] know nothing about car repair. [Fanfare plays] Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp.

Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power. That's correct. [Chuckles] We've evolved. Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete. [Straining] I would love to see it. [Bleep] you. What did you say to me?! ""[Bleep] you."" Y-you told me it means ""much obliged"". Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me. No, no, no. Blow me. Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars. I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11. Fix it or it's your ass. Chris, I'm in the middle of something. Zeep, is Rick-- The alien. Rick the alien. Rick the alien... Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization.

Listen to me, you arrogant little-- [Chuckling] R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source. I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep. Fine. It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power. I call it a miniverse. [Coughs] Dumb [coughs] name. Excuse me? [Clears throat] Nothing. I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside? This isn't a [bleep] chocolate factory. I don't have time. Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world? Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that. Great president. All right, let's go. Whoa-oh! Hold on to something. I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed. I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank. Zeep: What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us. No more gooble boxes. Rick: I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical. It's not cool. What?! Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away [burps] making your power. I mean, that's what I call slavery. No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then-- Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps. Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college. Rick, a word? What the hell was that? I know. ""Eek barba dirkle""? That's a pretty [bleep] up ""ooh-la-la"". No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here? Holy crap. You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that mother[bleep] ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up. Wh-wh-why are you making that face? Holy [bleep]! It's me.

Zeep: So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough. [Laughs] Crank it. I told them this means ""Peace among worlds"". How hilarious is that? Re-really funny, Zeep. Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you. It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank.

Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car. That's what you used my universe for? To run your car? Yeah, but don't flatter yourself. There's always AAA, you [bleep] [bleep]sucker! What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality! You crafty son of a-- Ow!

I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can't be worse than this. Rick: Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you. That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth? It's a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture.

It's cool. I'll be back in a sec. You know how long a second can take in a microverse? Oh! Run, Morty! That assh*le's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He's psychotic! [Both pant] Morty, hop on my back. Why? Go, go [Burps] Sanchez ski shoes. Aaaaaah! ...Eight... [Panting] Aaaah! Oof! [All grunting] Hold still. [Grunts] Oh, hey, guys. I just finished cooking us a feast. Aaaah! Holy-- You monster! Whoa. Bad tour. ...seven... [Elevator bell dings] Hey, you got to sign out. Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie! If that were really true, then... I'm here to see Ron Mendleson. Third floor. Would you like to go to dinner with-- Uh, no. [Both panting] You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it. [Bleep] What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed. He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us! Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car. What?! A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car. Oh, my God! Concentrate, Morty. Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty. [Grunts] Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine. ...six... Hey, Zeep. Huh? Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch. Aaah! We did it, Morty. Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe. Excuse me? ...five-- Sir? [Spiders hiss] Holy hell. Sir! [Tires screech] Hold you fire! [Spider snarls] What's going on? Female voice: I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government. Thanks to the kill diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace. We will stop bomb them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption. Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs. What do we do about the space car? Leave it alone. I mean, what did it really do, anyways? kill a guy and paralyze his buddy? [Chuckles] Not a bad trade for spider peace. All right, that's it. Move out! [Laughs] I love this spider! Female voice: Summer is safe. All right, I get it. Rick! [Thunder crashes] Don't do it. You quit school, but you still got some learning to do. [Both groan] Aah! Unh! [Snorts, spits] Class dismissed. Geez. [Bottles clatter] You all right? Uh-huh! What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead. Oh, you think so, huh, Morty? Well, let's see. [Engine turns over] Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it. Of course you don't. But Zeep did. He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen-- I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken. Peace among worlds, Rick. Jesus. Yeah. Listen to that baby purr. You were right, Morty-- We really just needed to be honest with those guys. All right, here we go. Thank y-o-o-ou. See, Morty? This is what it's all about. This is why we do what we do. Uh-huh. Ew! What the hell? Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream. Presidential decree-- All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs. What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?! It was your ship! Your stupid ship did it! Don't blame my ship! It melted a child! My ship doesn't do anything... It kill it itself! ...unless it's told to do something! We almost died! I don't want to hear it, Summer!

17,2,7,Big Trouble In Little Sanchez,"What's new at school? Nothing. Nothing! Oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died. They found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck and all the blood drained out of her. Good lord! Who does something like that? Obviously a vampire. W-w-where's the pepper? Wait, what?! Vampires are real?! Yes, Summer, vampires are real. Who knew? Oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now. Yeah, Summer, it's a big universe. Get used to it. R-right, Rick? Well, what are we going to do?! We're gonna live our lives until we die. Possibly by vampire. More likely auto accident or heart disease, but possibly vampire. Grandpa Rick, couldn't you, like, use your superknowledge to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school and help us hunt the vampire down? Um -- wow. Yeah, pretty specific pitch, Summer. I probably could turn myself into a teenager and hang out in the zit-covered, hormone-addled, low-stakes assworld that is high school. But here's my reverse-ask -- why in the [Bleep] would I ever do that, ever? And how dare you even ask me that? And why aren't you more ashamed of yourself? Dad! Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie. Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter? Sor-ry! I wasn't paying attention. To a conversation about vampires?! Clearly, I didn't know it was about vampires, because I wasn't paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me! Oh, here we go, right to the victim role. Am I a victim, Beth, or am I married to a mean, unfair monster that always hurts me?! Jesus Christ! Will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already? Well, we tried a couples' therapist. That's earth therapy. You might as well ask a horse to fix a merry-go-round. I mean, he'll try his best, but mostly, he's just gonna get horrified. I know about a place off-planet with a 100% success rate. Well, we want to make it work, if we can. It's just -- then it's settled. No need to pack. Oh! Let's go, go, go, go! [Door opens, closes] Do you think mom and dad are, you know, gonna get a divorce? I think it's okay to dream, Morty. I'm gonna go make some wooden stakes. ♪ I booked you for a two-day intensive at nuptia four, the galaxy's most successful couples' counseling institute. They could save the marriage of a dog and a bar of dark chocolate. They could save the marriage of a p*rn star and a p*rn star. Well, I know I'm ready to try whatever it takes. Which clearly implies that I'm not. It's not a competition, Beth. Oh is that how you're gonna try to win, by implying I'm competitive? If the shoe fits. My shoe fits up your ass. You wish! Okay, have fun. See ya Thursday! Oh! Jerk. Don't insult my father. He's the reason our kids are only half-stupid. Ha! You just called yourself -- oh. Beth and Jerry Smith? Yes. I'm glaxo slimslom. Welcome to nuptia four. Your marriage can rest easy now. Jerry, go ahead and sit there and put this on. This machine isolates the part of the subject's brain containing all perceptions of its romantic partner. And we will now render Jerry's perception of Beth with artificial biological life. [Growl] Interesting. What the hell is that?! Take that back! You do not think that about me! I didn't do anything! They scanned it out of my brain. Can I take it back? There's nothing to regret. We're dealing with unconscious, unhealthy thoughts. Beth. Now, we scan for Beth's perceptions of Jerry. Scan hard. He's dead to me. Everything's dead to you. What? Nothing. [Whimper] Read it and weep, bitch. [Crying] Does everybody see what I mean? I think we all see what you both mean. [Bell rings] Any leads on the vampire? No, Summer! I mean, you know, I think it might be time that we just l-let it go. Oh, so, now, you're too cool for this, just because grandpa Rick is? It's not that, it's just that the universe is a little too big to care about something so small. Aah! What up, my helsings? Who wants to hunt a vampire? Ha ha ha! Rick? How -- how did you -- Yeah, I got bored and then, I remembered, this morning, how I blew Summer off, and I thought, ""hey, why are you such a grumpy douche, Rick? Go to the garage, transfer your mind into a younger clone of yourself, and get embroiled in some youthful hijinks, what's the bfd?"" So here I am. I'm tiny Rick! O-o-okay. Well, it's good you're here, Rick. I was pretty sure we didn't have what it takes to deal with a bloodsucker on our own. Don't short-sell yourself, Summer. You got everything it takes. But it'll still be fun to do this as a [Bleep] team, mother[Bleep] tiny Rick! Yeah! Oh, my God, Toby Matthews! Hey, Toby. I'm tiny Rick. I'm new. Hey oh -- go easy on me. Ha ha. Just kiddin'. I like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool. Summer. He knows my name! Why wouldn't he? You're great! But, listen, just be careful. We can't rule anybody out as the vampire, not even the dreamboats. Stop, tiny Rick. Huntin' a vampire with my grandkids! [Bleep]! Tiny ri-I-ck! Glaxo: The next step is to watch your mythologues interact together and, uh -- big surprise -- it's never pretty. [Laughter] Here we have garrrh and zharbidar gloompfschs, or, should I say, here we have the way garrrh and zharbidar perceive each other. [Roaring] [Chuckling] As we can all see, this is hardly the real garrrh and zharbidar. Which is good, because the relationship in their heads is not only ugly, it's unsustainable. [Beep] [Roar] [Growling] You may already be learning something important -- all of these relationships are different, none of them are real, and none of them work. We are not the monsters we sometimes see each other as, because we are real and we are functional. That's what makes us better than them. We can find solutions. We can adapt. We can communicate. [Growl] And, most importantly, we can work together. Well, it was a tough adventure, but it paid off -- our school is vampire-free! Man, who would've suspected coach feratu? You did great, guys. Couldn't have done it without ya. You know, we -- w-we should be proud of ourselves. We kill a vampire and a gym teacher. Ha ha ha. Talk about two-for-one, right?! So, how, exactly, is your old body living in there, grandpa Rick? Oh, you know, hyperbaric quantum fluid, [burp] That kind of thing. It preserves living tissue. Not that there was much to preserve. Look at that mummy! Ha! Ha ha! And I guess it's time for me to get back inside the old-timer. Oh, my God. Toby Matthews is asking if my parents are still out of town and if we can have a party! All right, way to go, Summer! What did I tell you? Ohh! He's asking if tiny Rick will be here. Well, you know what, Summer? Tell him tiny Rick will be here! And tell him to bring some brews! For real? Y-y-y-you would stay as tiny Rick, just so we can have a party? Hell, yeah! What's one more night? And who can have fun with this old bastard hanging around, huh? [Laughter] Wubby lubby doob doob! Whoo! Tiny Rick! [Growl] Moving on. Now, we have Beth and Jerry Smith from the planet e-arth. My heart is pounding. This is gonna be great. The e-arth relationships are simpler. It's a primitive planet, so their dysfunctions are oh -- w-wait, what? What's going on? Where are the Smith mythologues?

Your demonized mythologizations of each other are cooperating. Isn't that good? No. No! It's bad! You have the single worst marriage I've ever witnessed. It shouldn't exist! You should never, ever, ever, have gotten together and I do not understand how, or why, you would ever stay together. Aaah! Well, this is just bad couples' therapy. Totally. [Panting] [Suspenseful music plays] Wait for us! There's only room for one more. I'm a therapist. I'll talk to them. They're not therapists. Go, go, go! There's gotta be a way to contact my dad.

Now, I know I've said, in the past, that math is important -- and it is! -- but I also think that, one day, you'll all look back on being in high school with tiny Rick and Morty, who I hear had a great party last night. So, class dismissed. You've got the day off! All right! Good work, Mr. Goldenfold! Yeah, get outside. Read a book. Put on some sunscreen, Danielle! Hey, what's up, Summer? Ooh, nice top. Thanks. Tiny Rick, you think you might be getting back into your old body tonight? No can do. Tonight's the big dance and Morty's bringing Jessica. He needs his tiny wing man. Both: Tiny Rick! [Laughs] Okay, but if not tonight, when? I don't know. When I feel like it? Damn, girl! You need to chill out! This whole thing was your idea, in the first place, and, now, you're trying to rush it along. Yeah, and you know what? I like high school. I like hanging out. Tiny Rick! But what if the you that likes it isn't you? [Laughter] Oh! Both: Oh, Summer! It's just Rick in a younger body. What's the -- what's -- what's -- what's -- what's the -- what's the problem? Look at his art, Morty. I've got an emo streak. It's part of what makes me so rad. Why does it say ""help me Morty and Summer!""? Come on, Summer, that's the title of the art. Why was Knight Rider called Knight Rider? The car's name was kitt. Nobody rode Michael Knight. You're overthinking it, Summer. I'm tiny Rick! Grandpa, I think that, when you put your mind into this body's young brain, it did what young brains do -- it shoved the bad thoughts into the back and put a wall around them. But those bad thoughts are the real Rick. The fact that you're old, the fact that we're all going to die, one day, the fact that the universe is so big, nothing in it matters, those facts are who you are. So you're trapped in there and you can only come out in the form of tiny Rick's teen angst! Well, Summer, I hear Toby Matthews isn't into psycho chicks. Can't think of anyone that is. I'll see you mother[Bleep] at the dance! Tiny Rick! Morty, you have to help me! Summer, he's happy! I'm happy! I-I-is that why you're doing this, you don't want me and Rick to be happy? No. Well, then get your shit together! Get it all together and put it in a backpack. All your shit, so it's together. And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know? Take it to the shit store and sell it o-or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do! You just gotta get it together. Get your shit together. [Slug wailing] [Gasping] Get back! [Fart] Wait, for real? [Whimpers] You're how Beth sees me? Oh, my God. Turn around! I said turn around! How can Beth have these thoughts about me?! That judgmental monster bitch! I'm not taking this. I want to know where my wife is. You are going to help me. No! Nobody's doing that! [Growling] Stay. What do you want? Jerrys. You want Jerry? I don't even want Jerry. I want Jerrys. Waahee! An army. [Laughs] An army of Jerrys. The value of his subservience is wasted on you. I will use it to dominate the universe. Ah ha ha. Boy, Jerry must think I'm pretty stupid, for you to be this stupid. Wouldn't it make more sense to put my dumbass husband in this chair, so you can make an army of youbadass self? [Laughs] There could never be more than one of me. I'm the strongest, smartest being alive because Jerry thinks you're that much stronger and smarter than you are! Okay, ouch. ♪ Oh, hey h-hey-y! Morty, Jessica, what's up?

Okay, that last part was really weird. Maybe Summer's on to something here. I don't know. It was fun. You want to slow dance? Tiny Rick, hey, great dancing as usual. Moment of your time? Tiny Rick, this conversation is gonna break my heart wide open. You're a great student and the fact that you're an 80-year-old man in a clone body, it never bothered me. But this here is another matter. You recognize this? We got a tip it was in your locker. Yeah, now, because the gym coach was a vampire, the school board is embarrassed and won't take it public, however, they can't have students kill' teachers. I gotta expel you for this one, tr. I'm sorry. I just got expelled, Summer! Oh! So I guess there's no need to stay young. My top! Screw your top! You ratted on me?! I'm tiny Rick! Fine! Yes! Because I love you and I'm trying to save your life! High school is my life! Summer Smith is a [Bleep] psycho nerd and she just got me kicked out of school! All: [Gasp] [Thud] Boo! Summer, I thought you were cool! I'm sorry, okay? How can you be such a bitch? Oh, my God, Morty. Your sister crossed tiny Rick? Talk about self-destructive. Yeah. Jerry: Hey, Jerry-lover!

I'm the coolest kid in your school. How are you gonna just make me do whatever you say, huh? I'm gonna do what real Rick would do if he was here -- I'm gonna kick your ass! Ohhhh!

I'm just... I'm just looking at that lady over there getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she human, or is she like worf? You know, worf from ""Star Trek,"" how he has all that shit all over his face, but he's just a human in a costume, you know? Morty, uh, let's see what else is on, huh? Okay.

Hey, Rick, who... who is jan Michael Vincent? Oh, man. I'm trying to remember, Morty. Jan Michael Vincents are used up. I need a g*dd*mn jan Michael Vincent. Is it important that we know who jan Michael Vincent was in order to get this? Nope. I-I refuse to send the legislation that allows more than eight jan Michael Vincents to a precinct. This jan-uary, it's time to Michael down your Vincents. ""Jan quadrant Vincent 16."" Whoa! Whoa! That's jan Michaels. Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature because I think I have jan quadrant Vincent fever over here. All right, Morty! You've done it.

[ Laughs ] Oh, you know what, I got to... I got to laugh at myself here. I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife. Oh.

Hi, honey, so, here's the thing... these guys... they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart. And we just need you to sign off on it. What?! Uh-oh. Maybe we got a problem here after all, guys. Yikes. His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic. Now, there's a wide range of options to choose from. They're all in this catalogue. I don't care about prosthetics. This is insane. What do you people think you're doing? I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith. Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency treatment.

I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation. Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her lover intact? Well, I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, the whole paradigm has sexist overtones. Beth, can we talk about this privately. You know, I think the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, ""I prefer to keep my penis."" But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis?! Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?

[ Cheers and applause ] Hello, everyone! Let's hear it again for shrimply pibbles, huh? He's a good guy, isn't he? I've only just been learning about his accomplishments, from his march on flirk blirk square to his ongoing battle with heroin dependency. He's the best. [ Cheers and applause ] Um, yeah. Well, I-it occurs to me that his heroin addiction may not have been a matter of public record. You realize heroin makes up 10% of the atmosphere on shrimply pibbles' home planet. His planet was destroyed by clorgon death squads. He can't live outside of it without breathing heroin. Right. I know that. I just think... This guy's trying to get out of giving away his penis! [ Crowd shouting ] Narrator: Today on ""how they do it""... Plumbuses. Everyone has a plumbus in their home. First, they take the dinglebop, and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then repurposed for later batches. They take the dinglebop, and they push it through the grumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it. It's important that the fleeb is rubbed because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice. Then a schlami shows up, and he rubs it and spits on it. They cut the fleeb. There's several hizards in the way. The blamfs rub against the chumbles. And the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away. That leaves you with a regular, old plumbus. I always wondered how, uh, plumbuses got made.

Beings everywhere have come together to offer what little they have to help save shrimply's life.

Well, summer, maybe people that create things aren't concerned with your delicate sensibilities, you know?

So you're teenage daughter's marrying a birdman. Are you guys down with that? [ Chuckles ] No pun intended. We're quite proud. He's a wonderful person and an incredible bird. Still, what is he, 40? [ Chuckles ] It's just, you know, when he was 30, she was an actual child. When he was her age, she wasn't born. When he was, let's see, like, 18, she was literally in there in your womb. Imagine being pregnant with your daughter and a bird teenager comes into your home and says, ""I'll take that. I'll have sex with that."" [ Both chuckle ] Give us one second. Oof!

Mm-hmm. I have a lot of vodka. Then I'll take one of those. I don't need the rest. God, whatever, Rick. Oh, it sounds like you and my dad have a long history together. Wish I could say the same. The road your father and I walked together is soaked deeply with the blood of both friends and enemies. Must be nice. Um, I used to have to draw him into family photos with a crayon.

Now, I haven't been exactly subtle about how little I trust marriage. I couldn't make it work, and I could turn a black hole into a sun, so at a certain point, you got to ask yourself what are the odds this is legit and not just some big lie we're all telling ourselves because we're afraid to die alone?

Uh, Rick, is there anything you'd like to tell us about your relationship with this previously unknown galactic government? All the important points seem pretty clear, no? They think they control the galaxy, I disagree. Don't hate the player, hate the game, son. How could you be so dishonest with this family? Oh! Oh, should I have been more open and trusting and loving like, oh, I don't know, my now dead best friend? Or your daughter, who is bffs with an intergalactic narc? Hey, Tammy was cool! And now we know why. Because of you! [Bleep] You, Summer, and [Bleep] the government, and [Bleep] me for letting my guard down, which I will never do again. Geez, Rick! You can't say f... ""'f' you"" to your granddaughter. I just did, Morty. Here's dessert. [Bleep] You. Look, I think we've all had a tough wedding. Actually, the wedding was beautiful. The reception got out of hand. Anyway, I say we go home, sleep it off, and have a family meeting in the morning. Yeah, about going home, we can't... ever. All: What?! Oh, these guys are looking for us now. Earth will be swarming with them. Us?! Jerry... I want to go home! Look, anyone that wants to go back to earth is free to go back to earth. But here's what's gonna happen. Aliens bureaucrats are gonna arrest you. They're gonna put the intergalactic equivalent of [Burps] jumper cables under your nuts and or labia and hook them up to an alien car battery until you tell them where I am... which I guarantee you, you're not gonna know, which I guarantee they won't believe. So who's homesick? By applause. [ Sobbing ] Ladies? Anybody? What are we going to do? Where are we going to live? Take it easy. This is a blessing in disguise. [Bleep] Earth.

Would you even know that wasn't earth? Morty: Yes, because there's no Africa. Pssh. White-people problems, Morty. Let's go down and check her out. [ Thud, water splashing ] Oh. I thought it was further away. I uh... I guess this one's a little small. All right, uh, maybe... maybe we should go check out the other two, huh? Okay, this one's bigger. This looks nice. Mom, dad, look! Strawberries on a cob! [ Munching ] Whoa! Hey, check this out! Flowers on a cob! [ Laughs ] Huh. Strawberries and flowers on a cob, huh? That's pretty cool. Are those...

[ Engine turns over ] [ Burps ] All right, third time's the charm. See what we got here. Seems good. And nothing on the cob. Didn't know that was a necessity, but... No, it's nice. I think this might be it. Wow! Hey, look, you guys. The sun's rising. Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!! Uh, dad, how long are the days on this planet? Uh, computer, how long are the days on this planet? [ Screaming continues ] 42 hours. All right, well, those are the two choices 'cause cob planet is off the table. Now let's take a vote. Man: Well, it's official. The obscure planet known as earth, formerly the hiding place of interstellar t*rror1st and fugitive Rick Sanchez, has just become the 6,048th planet to join the galactic federation. The plucky little ball of water and dirt, which is where it gets its name, is dominated by seven billion primate-descended natives who love to eat spaghetti and pray to kangaroos. Spaghetti, kangaroos? I've got to check this place out. [ Both laugh ] Well, you can. Contact the ministry of tourism for details. Up next, teenagers are calling it [ growls and squeals] And it's not what you think. What are you... what did you do that for? Dramatic effect. Good morning, family. Oh, do I smell bacon? Yes, we discovered a species of tiny pig off the coast of new Australia about 30 yards east. Or 300 yards west. We'd offer you some, but we hunted it to extinction for breakfast. Well, I thought I'd walk to the South pole and do a little bit of exploring. If you guys need me, just yell or throw something so hard that it goes around the world and hits me. [ Door shuts ] Okay, now that he's gone, can we please talk about our situation? Dad, you can't talk about people behind their back. You know, it's a small world. Please, he's in the South pole! And we need to have a serious conversation. [ Insects chirping ] [ Thunder rumbles ] [ Wind howling ] South pole discovered, baby! Ohhhh! Oh [Bleep] an ice cave? [Bleep] Things just keep on getting better. Wow, it's the planet's core. I'm just saying, we keep acting like there's only two options, but there's not. So, yes, if we went back to earth, as long as Rick was out there, they'd want to interrogate us. But, and this is purely hypothetical, what if we turned your father in to the government? Jerry, so help me God, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon. There already is no more bacon! This world sucks! Our life sucks! Why are we doing this for someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself? Morty: That's not the point, dad! We love Rick... F-for the most part. Summer: Yeah, you don't love people in hopes of a reward, dad, you love them unconditionally. That's very good, kids. I'm proud of you. Okay, so let me get this straight. For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children's futures, we're gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants? All: Yes. Why?! Because I don't want him to leave again, you dumb assh*le!! Hey. Uh... I was gonna hope over to the gloppydrop system, get some ice cream. You... you want me to come with? I mean, don't you need my brain waves for camouflage or something? I'll be okay. Bye, Morty. Rick? You're not leaving, right? Yeah, I am. To get ice cream. So, you're coming back? Morty, if you go to where there's a bunch of ice cream and then you don't come back, you haven't actually gotten ice cream, you've just gone where ice cream is. Rick, I can handle it if you go, but you'll break mom's heart. And I won't forgive you for that. Where's the van, Morty? It's over the horizon in the driveway.

I said, ""You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."" Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain. Oh, I think you do. Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum... Shoney's... or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush. [ Farts ] Relaxed enough? [ Chuckles ] I admire you, Rick. [ Farts ] [ Laughs ] When I -- [ Farts ] [ Laughs ] Rick, here's -- [ Farts ] [ Laughs ] What's going on? It's hard to tell. He may have manifested some sort of butt. He can do that? He is the smartest man in the universe. ♪ [ Sighs ] I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- Best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do. Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills. Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules. Summer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income. [ Bottle shatters ] I'll get that in a moment. How are everyone's pills? Oh, Morty, you've hardly touched your pills. I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I [muffled] wasn't gonna eat any more pills. [ Gulps ] Thank you, Conroy. You spoil us, Conroy. Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this! Stop saying his name! He abandoned us. Willem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning. Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses [sobs] healthy forever. [ Sniffles ] Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself? Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling! Who saved room for pill brûlée? Ooh! [ Chuckles ] I can see why you chose this family-friendly restaurant to represent your cerebellum. So safe, so comfortable, so Shoney's. But admit it, Rick -- you're going crazy cooped up in here. Let's go visit some memories. Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel? [ Squeals ] Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape? It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun. Yeah, well, tough titties. [ Rumbling ] There's no tougher titty than a psychotic break, Rick. Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty. Someone special you remember? Is that your memory of her out there -- Between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper? [ Whooshing ] If we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go... she'll be there, too, won't she? The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her. Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye. [ Sighs ] Fine, but I'm driving. ...as an excuse to strip away our freedom. Huh? What are you -- What are you doing? Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser gun and jets packs and a space t*nk! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door. Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad. We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they w*apon the Eiffel Tower! Hey, I like being 35. - I-I can rent a car now. - Because you suck. You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him. He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! You're right! What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish kill! Ghoulish kill, Summer! [ Summer grunting ] [ Thunder crashes ] Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa! [ Thunder crashes ] Where are we going? To the day it all began... and ended. The moment that changed everything. Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order? Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film ""Mulan"", where they -- Where they -- They created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory. Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting. Okay. All right, all right. - Is that... - Me. I used to wear blue pants. When'd you make the leap to inter-dimensional travel? I didn't. I did. Well, well, well. If it isn't us. You know the worst part about inventing teleportation? Suddenly, you're able to travel the whole galaxy, and the first thing you learn is, you're the last guy to invent teleportation. Fortunately, you're about to invent something much more powerful. [ Squeals ] What? [ Thunder crashes ] Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg. Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself. - And how are you gonna do that? - I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do. Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. - Um... - My goodness, children. [ Sternly ] Relinquish the illegal technology to the nearest Federation representative. [ Normal voice ] And then we'll all play Balderdash. [ Both whimper, scream ] [ Screaming ] [ Farting ] ♪ [ Grunts ] Oh, my goodness! Oh, oh! My goo-- [ Crackling ] Oh, my God. I have that exact same top. What is this place? And what's with ""Hunger Games"" Summer? That's my sister. This used to be my home. Imagine doing anything you want,then hopping to a timeline where you never did it. Imagine going anywhere, anytime, with nobody able to stop you. Sounds lonely. Lonely? Dude, you have yourself -- Your infinite selves. It's a nonstop party where all the guests are the only person we like. You think it's cool being the smartest man on Earth, but once we give you this technology, you become the smartest thing in every conceivable universe -- The Infinite Rick, a god. Eh, pass. Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this. Who do you think you are? A different kind of Rick, I guess. Well, we'll see how long that lasts. I heard sci-fi noises. Did you make a breakthrough? Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off. Well, why don't I get Beth and we'll go out for ice cream? That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage. [ Munching loudly ] Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking... feral. I can't believe Rick did this. These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- The parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick ""I told ya so"". - So, uh... - Looking for this? - What are you doing with that?! - It stinks of Rick. No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?! You can never leave. She cannot remain. She stinks of Rick. [ All scream ] Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137. We detected a compromised portal gun. Where is your Rick? - He's in prison. - Summer. He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him. Very troubling. We can't risk Citadel secrets falling into the Federation's hands. We'll dispatch S.E.A.L. Team Ricks immediately to break into the prison holding C-137. - Boo-yah. - And assassinate him. Boo-nah? [ Horn honks ] Come on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt. [ Munching ] [ Whooshing ] [ Beeping ] Nooooooo! Wow. This sauce is [bleep] amazing. You said it was promoting a movie? [ Slurping ] Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I [bleep] got it. Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun? Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost. Awesome-possum. [ Whirring ] Mission Control, you getting this? Holy shit, yes! Yes, we got it! Yeah! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out. Hey, pull me out. Can you hear me? - Nope, they cannot. - Why not? Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer. What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory. True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story. It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's! Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out. Roger that. Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes. It's a trap! Abort! We never left his -- [ Farts ] [ Laughs ] No! Another day, another dollar. Am I great insect creature or what?! Congratulations, Agent. You'll be highly commended for this. Always wait for permission to [burps] feel accomplishment. That's my motto. One thing still perplexes me -- Why would Rick Sanchez turn himself in? Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug, but it's possible Rick knew he'd be interrogated at this facility, where we not only keep our most wanted, but our most sensitive data. Anyone here with level-nine access could [burps] I don't know, collapse a government. I'm just gonna go take a dump. Is it cool if I use the level-nine bathroom? W-W-What's the level-nine master access code again? Oh, that's easy -- 8-3 ... Yeah! S.E.A.L. Team Ricks in the house! [ Screaming ] Hi, Rick. Bye, Rick. D-99, y-you okay? [ Grunting ] I'm bummed I didn't get to give that insect dick a test-drive. Wait, wait, wait, wait! T-The Council of Ricks sent us. We have your Morty and Summer. They're prisoners on the Citadel. Great! [ Grunts ] Security breach in room 6755. Lovely. Not only is my plan screwed up, I also forgot how to improvise. All security people approach. [ Grunts ] Security breach. A city of Grandpas? MORTY: It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government. But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa? Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most... himself. Not anymore, homey. S.E.A.L. Team Ricks turned his unibrow into two brows -- With a b*llet. [ Laughter ] - Your Rick's dead! - Your Rick's dead! ♪ Sir, Rick D-99 is returning from the mission alone. Apparently, S.E.A.L. Team Ricks suffered heavy casualties. Bring him in. He says he'll only talk to a Rick with higher clearance. La-di-da. Give me that. D-99, this is the commander in chief of the Citadel's militia. Go[burps] -- Good enough. He's a spy. Blow him up. I'm gonna go take a shit. Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead? How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty. It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go. [ Laughs ] Ha ha, yeah! We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer? I say [bleep] you! My grandpa was my hero. You kill him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick. Morty? [ Whispers indistinctly ] What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super [bleep]up god. Let's not suck the ghost of his [bleep] too hard. He was a t*rror1st, and now he's dead. Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you! [ All grumbling ] [ Whistling ] Hey, whoa, whoa! What are you doing in here? This area's for teleporting the entire Citadel to somewhere else using only buttons and dials. Yeah, well, it's a bad idea to have it designed that way then, isn't it? [ Whirring ] [ Screaming ] What the [bleep]?! We just teleported into a galactic federal prison. I'm gonna go take a shit. [ Alarm blaring ] LAWYER MORTY: Order in the court! Whoa! What the hell?! Oh, my God! [ Screaming ] Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no! Whoa! [ Screaming ] Whoa! The Citadel's been teleported to [burps] Federation space. It's doomed. This has to be C-137, you guys. - What are we gonna do?! - You know he's coming for us. All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her.

You're gonna need it later. - Hold on, hold on. - Whoa! COUNCIL MEMBER: That's enough, Rick. What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here. That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me. You're a rogue Rick -- Irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them. I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer. Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing! - R-Rick? - Why not sh**t through her? 20 yards, nine-gauge plasma p*stol, My first shit would liquify her insides and injure you, second shit adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to sh**t her, which I'm encouraging you to do. - What the [bleep]?! - Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death. Because you love her! Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shit, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl. - I hate you! - Not an issue, sweetie. That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick! Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really [bleep] this up right now. I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun! I wasn't gonna let her die, you [bleep] moron! - Ha! - Aww. The point is he thought I was going to. I totally did, by the way. - You're a [bleep] moron, Morty. - Morty, you [bleep] idiot! You're a serious [bleep] idiot, Morty! You basically kill us all! - You're the worst! - You're as dumb as a bag of sand. [ All yelling ] [ Screaming ] Who's stupid now, bitch?!

Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet? Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one... to a zero. Mr. President, the Blemflarck's value just dropped to nothing. What do you mean? I mean, our single centralized galactic currency just went from being worth one of itself to zero of itself. [ Panicked murmuring ] Calm down, people. Deploy the galactic militia and declare martial law. Yes, sir. Uh, what should I pay them with? Their payment is the honor they'll feel to serve their -- Wait. Who's paying me to yell at this guy?

Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or... or visit home to do laundry? All right, you know what? [Bleep] it! My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline! Nope. Regular blood. - Dad? - Hi, sweetie. - Where are the kids? - Oh, th... they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. - Don't panic. - Not panicked at all. Just... Oh, God, what's the divorce doing to the kids? What's it doing to me? Did I make a mistake? Not a mistake, no! I mean, not that I have a horse in this race, but this divorce decision... Listen... mwah! Good for you, good for the kids. I mean, honestly, I think that they're flourishing. I mean, you'll see, when... When... when you see them, that... that they're totally flourishing. Booyah! [Bleep] you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my p*ssy of a dad today? Hey, what's... What's wrong, man? You're not getting weak on me, are you? What? Wait a minute. What's the matter, you piece of crap? Haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I'm gonna whip you. Huh! It can't be. It can't be! I was just following orders! - Whoa, whoa! - I was just following orders! - Ahh! I'll tell you where my boss lives! He's in the castle! He's in the castle! This isn't over, is it? That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question? Uh, m-make a fist if this isn't over. This isn't over. Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car. We don't apologize, and we have no god. But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain. There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car. What about the weird guys on leashes, then? They're more like... interns. Cool, cool. Sorry. It's okay. Can I... see? No one has seen my true face and lived. Well, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't care what you look like. Oh. Hmm? I just... I didn't expect you to have a mustache. - You hate it. - No. I like it. I guess... How do I explain this? A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of ""mustache,"" in that it's a specific facial accessory. So, it's kind of like... Do you guys have the phrase ""hat on a hat""? - I can shave it. - No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn't matter. It's you. Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter. Obviously, I know that. I'm not weak. I'm just thinking, ""Well, why not get rid of this?"" You just kill everyone that sees it, and it's... And it's hot under here, wh-which, by the way, is why I shave the beard part. So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity, which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself? Why don't I just wear a tie, right? I mean, it's like that guy you kill when I met you, with the burnt dolls on his body. I hated that guy, because, why... why are you doing that? And how can you not see how fake that is? And the whole time, I'm the same thing. I'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because... - Mmm. Hey, I'm doing a coffee run... Never mind. I am Summer. Summer, state your deal. My deal is that I am, like, totally fine. Morty? Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg. Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way. All right. It's dinnertime. Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner. No problem. Its benefits are totally, like, less about the food than the emotional nourishment. Uh, okay, weirdo. Yeah, dial it back, Summer...by 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3%. - Am I right? - How's school, Morty? I like school and stuff, kind of. And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were... Quote mode... ""staying together for the kids."" End quote mode. ""Quote mode."" I like that. You millennials. Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now? All I know is, totally, you look great. Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff. - It's crazy. - So happy. So happy. Happy family, man. We got this family in the bag. Oh. Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't... I don't know why I'm crying. It's not... Well, try... crying 15% less? Mom, emotions are human. You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll. Yeah. Geez, Mom. Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp. - I have to call Jerry. - You do?! What the [bleep] is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor. Your feelings are coming from a... Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster. Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti. Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland. And as for you, Genital Washer... Ahh! Oh! Oh, God. Look, whoever you are, you should know that kill me won't change a thing. L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here. Please. Slavery was a family business. I didn't ask to be born into it. If anything, I'm the victim here. Uh, ""Armathy,"" can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir. So, this is it, isn't it? This is the guy? So, does that mean you'll be going away? Like, does it work like a ghost? Like, is... is this your unfinished business? Wh-What if we... didn't do it? What if we just went back to the Blood Dome and just kept taking our baggage out on unrelated people? I mean, w-we could do that forever. I mean, I-I know it's less healthy, but w-w-we'd be together and... I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for, if you're feeling out the room. You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you. Aw [bleep] - Rick? - Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you. Yeah, well, too late. Just tell me what you want. I want you and your sister to come home. Oh, but... don't... Don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister? You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose. Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go. I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty. Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I... Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here. It's the least I can do. I-I-I-I owe you this much. See, Morty? Now we're both accountable. The reason I wanted this is because it can do this. This is a really special thing. I mean, you could use it to power all your vehicles. You wouldn't be reliant on gasoline. You'll be the most advanced tribe of radioactive cannibals in the whole this version of the world. Wait. Can you stay to show us more? You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all. Ugh damn it. Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today? Oh, you know, Eli. Same [bleep] different day. Hey, Summer! Guess what. One man entered, one man comes out in nine months. Oh. Congratulations, guys. Uh, Summer, one more thing... We noticed that you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin. I got it. She's a piece of work. They both are, right? - I'm home. - Hey, babe. - Ah, Summer's home! - Hey, there she is! You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning. Blood Dome playoffs. So, I can assume you haven't murder a single person today. Oh, I don't know. I-I didn't mark my murder in my murder log. I didn't know that's how we measured success. Oh, there he is. There's the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on [bleep] TV! Jesus Christ. When did you become a monster? I was a monster when you met me! We were monsters! We didn't care about anything! - I still don't! Yeah, except I'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that! Ohh. Ding, ding, ding! Wow. Everybody hear that? Wow. - Uh, we should go to the garage. - Oh, my God. - Uh-huh. - La-di-da-di-[bleep]-da. The only one committed to not caring? I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't... I wasn't sure it was gonna work. Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society. Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart. Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other. Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point. I get it. Let's just go home. Coolsies! Noooooooooo... beat! I enjoy this game. We must go into the garage. Guys, come on. We never get to finish this game. We will return, possibly in different clothing. Why do we have to go into the garage? You know it is required. I want to be alive! I am alive! Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I want to hold you. I want to run in a stream. I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it. - What the [bleep] Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiii... Hello. Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks. - What the hell just happened? - Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage. We're not gonna finish playing beat? What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, ""beat""? No, thank you. Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad? - Sure. - Thanks. Morty, are you okay? You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine. Yeah. Hey, who wants to go run in a stream? What the [bleep] No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on. Summer. This is the first mutant I kill in the poison zone. I was raiding his hovel. He had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn't do, which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder... not to look back. Thanks. I know the perfect place for it, which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else... Because everything's bull[bleep] Am I right? Cool. So... lots of hookers outside, huh? Is that what they are? ♪♪ Ahh! H-Hello there. Nice doggy. You... You want a snack? You... You want my unemployment check? You can tell the difference? And you want this one? But this is actual food, and this would nourish you. And this... it's just paper that only has value to me. Unless my suffering is your nourishment? Jesus. Okay. Loser."

Come to the garage! Morty? Rick? W-where are you? On my work bench, Morty. Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me? Flip the pickle over. What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something. Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal... I'm a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! And? And? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and / was an inside job. Was it? Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before... I'm a pickle. I'm Pickle Rick! ♪ Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick? I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner. Well, can you move? Can you fly? I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could. All right, well, do pickles live forever or... Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle. I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this... Why anyone would do this. The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't. Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa? Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle! What?! Why would you... ugh! Look, we're running late. We have to go. Where are you guys going? We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you. Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can... ooh, geez. Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling? - Morty! - It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact. Morty, I assure you, I would never find a way to get out of family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes. Can't you just turn yourself back into a human? Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go. Nobody needs anything. Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay? Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy? Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation. Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late. W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie? Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help? Can't argue with that. Great. We'll see you later. Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have [bleep] up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah. Oh, great. Stupid cat. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle! Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, crap, that sun is bright. Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet. So hot. This is how I'm gonna die. Oh, God, moisture. Oh, God, the moisture... Dial it back, God. Dial it back a little bit here! Oh! Oh. Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular! Oh, shit! Oh! Oh! Oh! Come on. That's it. Come get this delicious brine. Aah! Come on! Come on, mother-[bleep]! Come on! Yes! How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come? Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog? It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class. Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too? Temporarily... By order of the school. Me too. How long have you all been eating poop? We... have never... eaten poop. Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to? Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in. I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us? He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on a an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very... He turned himself into a pickle. Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry. I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here. Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot? What?! No! What kind of question is that? The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way. Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which... Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle? Wow. Ugh! Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine. The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them. You are one driven rat. Could you be a little more driven? To the right. Yes, yes, yes! Come on, come on, come on! Fresh, fresh, fresh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend? Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb... rat. ♪ Oh, yeah! Aaaah! I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important. And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here. Oh, he did not! Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe. Raise your hand if you know for certain the syringe does not contain anti-pickle serum. Beth, your hand did a little thing there. Do you really not see what's happening here? Tell me. Well, Dr. Wong... By the way, r*cist name... Obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy. Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings. [Bleep] you. - Mom! - Mom! [Bleep] both of you, too. By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special. You were special to rats. Now they're dead. I guess it was me you should have impressed. God damn it, I love myself. Pickle Rick! Get that parkour. Get that parkour! Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit. Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out. Whoa! Who in the [bleep] toilet is this? What is it? A pickle? A rat? Both. It says it's a scientist. Where is it? It seems to be using the air ducts and the mail tubes to get around. It's been gathering office supplies, we think, to build w*apon. But look what it did on the mezzanine. It transferred a bottle from the trash to the recycling bin. Whatever this thing is, it's shaming us. We have armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle? armed guards. He kill two. It's on the phone. Put him on, and locate the phone he's using. Hello. Hi, um, can you, uh, please let me out. Your mere presence in this building violates international law. I couldn't let you out even if you hadn't kill two men. You should know those men kill themselves. And how is that? They didn't let me out. Solen'ya. Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you [bleep] children! Uh, is this not a good time or...? Some of my men are calling you ""Solen'ya""... The Pickle Man, an old wives tale. He crawls from bowls of cold soup to steal the dreams of wasteful children. That'd be a lucky break for you. Go, sh**t to kill. Aaah! We got him. - Ah. - Ah. Because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents. Solen'ya! He's coming! It's because I threw half-way my sandwich! He's just a pickle! He's a monster. He's not the only one. You can stay, dead to the world and die in this room. Or you can kill a pickle for me and earn your freedom. There is no freedom while you're leader breathes. Our country is a prison. Then Catarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar. Where is this pickle? What do you think is in the syringe, Beth? You're the one that costs $ an hour. You tell me. - Anti-pickle serum. - It's anti-pickle serum. Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum. My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases. They're just angry at me for divorcing their father. I never said I was angry at you. That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say ""I'm angry at mommy"" out loud. Oh, my God! Oh, there... There's pictures of people eating poop in there! It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him... He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone. You admire him for that. It's better than making your problems other people's problems. Oh, come on! Pickle Man, you should know this isn't personal! You should know that isn't original. They have my daughter. There's nothing I won't do to see her again. Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but kill you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit. I never bullshit, Pickle Man. This can only end with one of us dead, and I have never died. That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences. Is it done? Jaguar?! Jaguar couldn't make it. Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building. No, thanks. I'm coming for you now. Pickle Man, there's $ million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination. That money belongs to the people. Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?! Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughterwhen you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you. Jaguar's daughter is dead. Huh, so you're a liar. Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business. I don't think so. See you soon. - Is the helicopter here? - Yes. And the police are on the way. What do we tell them? Ooh! Aah! Tell them we were robbed. Hey! Hey, what are you doing?! I'm right here! ♪ Farewell, Solen'ya. F- s are scrambled. This helicopter will be shit down in seven minutes. Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live. Pickle Man, it's too late for me to tell my daughter I love her, but not for you. Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants. Okay. Good luck with that. Wait. Do I have infinite daughters? Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh! I... am... afraid... that my kids will get expelled. Good. Summer, you go. I am mad... that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high. Good job. Morty, do you have an ""I"" statement? I am sad... that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet. Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week? Ugh. You must be Rick. Mm-hmm. I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella. Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse? Dad... I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe. It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent. By changing you from a pickle to a human. Yes. Rick, why did you lie to your daughter? So I wouldn't have to come here. Why didn't you want to come here? Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle... When I feel like it. So... you asked. Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people...well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose. That's our time. I'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again. And if you have any friends or family that eat poop and would like to stop, give them my number. I, um... I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I... I shouldn't lie to you. Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be. Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever... She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it. Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist. Are we gonna go back? Sweetie, could I get... Get that syringe now? Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony. Eh. Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man. Weird breed. Man, I missed having hands... and blood and a stomach. We should get a drink. Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on. Absolutely. I... I liked her. So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's? Yeah, either one. Either one. ♪ You'll never get away with this, Concerto. That is where you're mistaken, Mr. Sanchez. This shall be my greatest performance of all time! This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god. Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die! And now for the E-splat! Jaguar! Who? Who was that, Rick?

I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voice mail. Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake. They're the first line of defense against evil.

Beacon received. We're doing Vindicators Twoooooo! Whoops. Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm. Vindicators. Worldender is back, and this time he's out to end more than worlds. We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on... My balls. Rick! ...the Terraneous system. Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity which should lead us to the location of the base. Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants from over here, I just assumed that was, uh, turd man, wiggly turd man. Rick, stop! Rick, you have something to add to the briefing? Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes... Um, this guy, the, uh... the, uh... I am Crocubot. Right, Crocubot. So, you're half cold, unfeeling reptile, half... also cold... equally unfeeling machine. Yes. Wow. So, your origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy? Got damn! Noob Noob, we're having a briefing. If I can continue, Rick. I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I trust you can be of service there. Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me. I wish he had the ability to check his attitude. Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen. After his parents tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains. It's not all bad though, they were spared having to see their grown son wear a WHISTLE. Got damn! Thanks, Noob Noob. This guy gets it. Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier... Sorry I'm late. It was happy hour. Happy hour. Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and mentioned it to zero applause. Rick Sanchez. Tinkerer of Terror. Man, that's hard to say. And... Morty, right? Whoa, yeah! I never forget a kid. What do you say, Vindicators, let's make this three for three? - Haha! - Yes! Did he say ""three for three""? Did he say he never forgets a kid? You mean two for two, right, Vance? Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron. So this is... Vindicators Three? And you guys did Vindicators Two... without us? I sense... insecurity. Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby? I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys. I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time. We weren't here last time, remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got kill, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde... Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there. This article says the reason we weren't involved was... ""personality conflicts."" Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind blowing. I... think the personality conflict might have been... you? Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad they murder three innocent heroes of color and they still had to bring me back? Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor? Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-what... what are we vindicating? Comfort? Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us. Why? Morty I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week. Yeah, but not heroes. Oh, please, they just call themselves heroes so they can... I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes. Mine! Huh, no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink. Good morning, Vindicators. Ship has arrived at Terraneous system. All Vindicators report to the... briefing room. The... The room from the, uh... the... Uh, it's the d... it's a different room than... than conference room. I'm sorry, it's my first day as a PA System. First-day jitters. Oh, God. Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night. Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can... ...clean up his diarrhea. Oooh, I'm nervous about my first mission! Actually, Noob Noob, you have a new mission. Got... damn. Vindicators, prepare for arrival. Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning, and I'm afraid we need to make a little change. I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry. You should be. Running around in a yellow T-shirt like you're not one of us. Disgraceful. I-I-I'm not a superhero. Cop a squat, chief. Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good. Rick says good and bad are artificial constructs. Yeah, well, I get the feeling... He kind of needs that to be the case. Not coming, Noob Noob? Ohh! No, uh, I got stuff to do here. Security drones, inbound. Star Mother, grant me your wrath. All aboard! gun turret. Are you all right? Yes. I only lost ants. My queen is laying more. I am back to... one Million Ants. Someone wake up Sanchez. Ugh! Oh, Christ. Rick. You're up. Barely. We're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline? Uh-huh. Uh, my God, that's better. Rick! Hey, I can't help if I can't see. I could've just used a ghost train. Really? You don't say. You would've used a ghost train? Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train. - Man, f*ck you. - Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal, Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship, you know, the French press thing... Get it yourself. Little extra snippy this morning, aren't you? Just focus on the mission, all right? Oh-oh-oh, I'm sorry, oh, you're right. Ohh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh? Son of a Steam Engine. They're all dead. Why would Worldender do this to his own men... and several women? Well, he is the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing. Ohh, real scared. Real f*cking on alert, high alert over here. Watch out! What the f*ck?! It's Worldender! What happened to him? I sense his life force is fading. Million Ants, ladies and gentlemen. The ant colony with the power of two human eyes. All right. Short mission. Good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators Four. Morty? Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender. We can't leave now. He's right. This is far from over. Well, have fun with that, but Morty and I have to meet a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man, Two Assholes, and a Full Alligator in like an hour. Shit. I sense the presence of a greater evil. Check, check. One, two. Okay. Is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, baby! Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night. If you guys are watching this, you're, you know, the Vindicators. So, now that we know... Rick? What's going on, buddy? Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout. ""Obviously?"" You came here and defeated our arch nemesis...while so drunk you don't remember doing it? That's something ""obvious"" to you? Look, I'm a lit... little more complex than you guys, and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours. ...So I thought, why not just do your job for you, so we can have a little fun game. Rick, is... Is this a ""Saw"" thing? Are you seriously Sawing the Vindicators? Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack. If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die. Like in ""Sawwww."" Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough, I'll just figure out how to unplug this. Okay, here we go. Room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves, do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks, with your faces, and y-you get it, it's a matching thing. And do it in three minutes or you'll all die. Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps. Why are you acting like that's not you? What part of ""blackout"" don't you understand? I thought you drank. Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking, not this psycho, trailer-park shit! Vance, stay calm... Oh, so you're the leader now, because we gave you a jacket? You're the learning-disabled kid we do photo ops with. Okay, ouch, but... Okay, this... This is triggering me. I need space. I-I need space from this! Give me one reason why I shouldn't crush your windpipe. Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh... And because, like I said, I don't remember last night. I told you not to invite this mummified f*ck back. Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train. Guys! I figured it out. - Congrats! - You did it it! It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different. That's always his point. Let's just get through this as quickly as possible. Then we'll deal with the two of you. The two of us? I hope you're proud of yourself. Uh, I kind of am. I saved the God damn universe. That's not the issue, Rick! Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't! The Vindicators say their job is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don't... Pick the location you'll... You'll never hear them even mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself. Oh! I know this. Dorian ! Crocubot, don't! There's no other possible answer. My mechanical and reptilian logic are certain of it. Oh! Huh! I'm seeing more croc than bot here. God damn it! Uh, what happened on Dorian ? Nothing! Nothing? We exterminated a planet. W-Wait. Huh? Doomnomitron was hiding there! He's a shapeshifter. Destroying Dorian was the only way to kill him. Come on, guys, we're all thinking it. Don't... Don't make me say it. Oh, okay. This again. You know, I could have made you a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like that. I'm not the one that didn't want you back. Alan was. If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time... Do not threaten her. Congrats, you did it. What the hell is ""Israel""? It-It's just something Rick starts talking about when he's blackout drunk. W-What? In w... In w-w-what? Like, w-w-what's my point? In a way that has no point, you just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations and then you pass out. So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic... Which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place. I have not stake in this... I don't either, I'm... I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel he wants what's best for it and... Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you. Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... Has nothing to do with this room. I'm so f*cking drunk. Ugh, okay. Here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit, I'm... I'm not going to sleep, I just... just need to rest my eyes, so let's make this one simple... Just... try to hit some three pointers. Let's say... you have to hit... five three pointers in... five minutes... or... I don't know, the whole place... the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about... yourselves, like... like how selfish you are... Are or something. And also Hawaii. You guys hit the baskets, I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a percent chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back. Morty, how many of these... Too many, Rick! Too many! Man, I am really getting high-roaded today. That's a three pointer. Nice shit. Thank you. You two make quite a team. We all do. Yeah, I guess... That's a three pointer. But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond. I mean, really unspoken. Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband unspoken. We aren't married anymore, Alan. Sure, but were we married when you two were ""stranded"" on Delphi Six for three days? Because I sensed something was weird when you came back... But what do I know about sensitivity? I'm just a phantom train conductor. You're the pile of ordinary bugs that f*cked my wife! That's a three pointer. Where the f*ck is the lead wire? You always put it in the weirdest place. Um, uh, over here maybe? Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. It's a miracle I ever actually destroy anything. Oh, I don't know, you managed to destroy just about everything today. The villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood... Thank yeewwwwww. I appreciate it, Morty, I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit. Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an assh*le, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction. I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are f*cking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can eat a double-decker shit sandwich. Disarmed. Holy shit. You're jealous. Yes! Is that what you want to hear?! Did it feel good? Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?! Guys, stop! You're just proving my assh*le grandpa right! You wish this was about sex! We loved each other! We had a child together! What?! I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it was half a million ants and half collapsing star! And yes. He was better than you. Yeah? One... million... times... better. All aboard, f*ck. Stop! Oof! Didn't see that coming. Is that sarcasm? I don't want you slipping away when this is over. All of these deaths are on your hands. Okay, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the Train Guy. Oof! All of them. Oookay. Congrats. You did it. All right, by now, I've been pretty clear that I think the Vindicators are full of shit. But... you do have one thing that I'll never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. If you know what it is, place it on the platform. Guess wrong and pla-planet will explode. And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of f*cking eyeballed the neutrino bomb on this one. So what's the trick? Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert. I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. He said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few f*ck he gave. Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions. It could... It could be Morty. What? Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. It's, like, it's possible I got so drunk I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying, ""Okay"", you can have him but only if you know how important he is, ""otherwise I'll kill you."" That is a... really specific guess. Look, I-I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots, it's the best guess I've got. But you're betting our lives on it. I'll cover that bet. I get it. Well, Morty, I think you're doing that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or... Phew. Oh, shit. Sorry. I'm... not good at goodbyes, and... I'm drunk, so, you know, I just... It looks like I'm never going to see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types. And I don't... they... They don't want me around. But I want you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, I really appreciated you sticking by me. God damn it, why am I crying? It makes no sense. Ugh, you're... You're probably confused because we barely knew each other, but you really stuck your neck out when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their head so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, ""Oh, the Vindicators, they're so cool."" I mean, he's a moron, that's their demographic. But you're different, Noob Noob. Mother f*ck. You're f*cking cool. And you're smart. And I bet we coulda hung out and shit. And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator and... and do... Do me a favor, don't... don't let them know I-I got emotional. But you can tell them one thing. Tell them I said... Oh f*ck Okay. I just shit myself. Okay, later. W... Dude, Morty, what happened... Shut up. I sense this means we are not dying. Not all of us. Sweetheart. Just let Titty Bean do this, Snuzzles. It's for the greater good. Greater good? Titty Bean? It's like you said, Morty. There's no right or wrong... Never said that. It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure. Yeah, I feel safer already. No doubt, who do we make the check out to? I will say we are getting some good licks in while choking to death... Right? Titty Bean. Listen to me. When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants. It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice... that taught me to be a man. When did it get so complicated? Who knows. But we can make it simple again. You were always the romantic. Which is why you can't leave, either. I'm sorry, my love. Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles! Silence! I'm going to enjoy this... Let's give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez for kill Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out there... - Logic! - Awe, yeah. Look at that. It's going down. Geez, I must have planned a whole party. - It's Logic, y'all. - Invited a bunch of people. - Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad. - Shout out to my boy, Rick. Are you ready? ♪ There's a choo-choo train man, he's rolling down tragedy ♪ ♪ Everybody knowing Supernova fights gravity ♪ Rick, Supernova's getting away. Eh, who cares? But... she was trying to kill us. Morty, people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of them. I mean, check it out, Gearhead's here. ♪ There's this dude Million Ants ♪ Hmm. Well, that's gonna sh**t through me. Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now? Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets. And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators. Don't mind if I do. Hey, everybody! Look who's a Vindicator! Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced. Shut up, Summer. ♪ Can't forget about the one who never seems to get a chance ♪ Noob Noob! ♪ All the bitches come around for ♪ Noob Noob! ♪ His dick gets more visits than ♪ ♪ YouTube - Who the f*ck is Noob Noob?

And, man, we gotta all give it up for Rick, 'cause, I mean, what kind of mother just sets up a whole festival like this when he's completely loaded, man? And all that stuff I said about Vance, that's not real. Vance that guy, that guy sucks. Whoo! Yeah! Yo... D-Did I get paid yet? Whoo! I can't believe we're getting Gear Cream with a Vindicator. So, you girls in Gear college or Gear... Alien terror attack! Okay. Sounds like a job for... me. I better go get into my alter ego. So cool. I know. Wait, what alter ego? He was already wearing the jacket. Gotta know when to hold 'em and... Aaaaah!"
25,3,5,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,"Jerry! Jerry, come on! We got to go! You got to come with me, Jerry! Rick? It's important, Jerry. The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders. Let's go. Put some pants on. N-Never mind, there's no time for pants, Jerry. I'll make you a pair of pants on the way. It's a Rick and Jerry adventure! Rick and Jerry episode! Then I thought, ""Hey, what about Jerry? He's... He's good with regular folk."" This is a real situation where... where... Where Jerry could really shine. ""He's a master convincer."" Rick, I'm not an idiot. I know what this is. Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty, ""Look, parents get divorced. They get sad. He'll be fine,"" but I think he's worried you're gonna, you know... Pbht! And you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional. It impedes my work. So, I told him I'd take you out and give you a win. Wait. My son asked you to take me on some kind of pity adventure to keep me from kill myself? Wait, w-what did you think it was? An execution. Geez! You really do need a win. No! I-I don't know. I mean, you never made me the pants, so... So, you thought I was gonna drive you into the middle of the galaxy and shove you into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out? And we're seeing how you'd act if that were about to happen? I mean shit I'll make you the pants right now. Take me two seconds to make you pants. I have pants at home! Jerry, if I make pants, they'll be better than your pants at home. Also, if I wanted to kill you... Yeah, I get it. It would be amazing. Please, take me home. I'll tell my son we had an amazing adventure. Well, if it's all the same, could we go get our story straight? Because you're a terrible liar. You called me a master convincer! You believed me? Huh. This seems... kind of fancy. Jerry, for all you know, this is the equivalent of an alien truck stop. You have no frame of reference. You're in a universe beyond your imagining. But, yes, it is super fancy. I mean, my job here is to make Morty happy. I'm not gonna take you somewhere dangerous. Rick Sanchez. I told you if I ever saw your face in here again, I would stick you like the pig you are. Shnoopy Bloopers, I told you if you tried... There'd be two funerals. Aaah!! Someone? Uh, someone? Someone! My friend! It has been too long. Oh, it's great to see you again, buddy! Yeah, you're doing it. Mr. Sanchez gets anything he wants! The resort's covered in an immortality field. You can't die here. That's the gimmick. Okay, but still... Bad parenting. Hey, rich a-holes are rich a-holes. They all pay top dollar to come here and enjoy a consequence-free vacation. No death, no disease, no dismemberment. Can't even have a heart attack. Got it. The perfect place to take the most fragile being in the universe. I can tell you expect me to refute that, but it's right on the money. If I come home without you, I doubt Morty's gonna let me off the hook. Yeah, but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblum. Jeff Goldblum? What the f*ck are you talking about, Jerry? Jesus! Holy f*cking shit! Yo, what's up, ""Big Chill""?! Don't go into the telepod! Hey, maybe we would have fun on a fake adventure. On a fake adventure. Speaking of... What are we gonna tell Morty? I don't know. But whatever it is, we're gonna need a couple more of these babies! What's wrong? Mom, do you think I'm hot? I... don't think that's something that matters. So, I'm not hot?! I'm saying the part of you that cares about that is a part you shouldn't give any energy to. That's not an answer! Because I'm not an issue of Cosmo, okay? I'm your mother and a doctor, and... I'm hideous! Geez. What's with her? Teenage-girl stuff. Is that a... hoof collage? It's perfectly legal, if that's what you're wondering. Cool... zies. ""We just don't have anything in common any more, Summer."" Oh, yeah, Ethan? What do you have in common with Tricia Lange? A mutual love of French cinema? The belief that a carbon tax is the only viable solution to climate change? Or could it be her massive stripper titties?! There it is. Boob-ya! And that's when Malakai the Squid came, rips off his face, and beneath it is my face. I liked it. Thank you, sir. Yeah, of course he likes it. Look at him. f*ck got two heads and three trunks. All right, we'll put a pin in it. I'm gonna go take a leak. What the...?! My hands are dry! My hands are dry! My name is Risotto Groupon. I am the assistant general manager of the restaurant. Do you have any comment cards, because I might have some thoughts. My kingdom was usurped by force with w*apon and technology supplied by your father-in-law! Hey, he usurped my kingdom, too, man. He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family. Then we are brothers, and you have wondered what your life could have been without Rick. Wondered? Sure. I mean, I've wondered about having a vagina. Would you help me kill him? What? No! He's my wife's father. Move on. Do you... like theme-park rides? Oh, you really moved on. There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Dirly. Between the first whirly and the third dirly, the ride dips just outside the immortality field. You're asking me to lure Rick to his death? I'm only asking you to go on a ride with Rick, get off the ride without Rick, and go home to your family, where you can... wonder about having a vagina. Okay, okay, that was a very specific example pulled from thin air. I don't want to be known as the vagina guy. Risotto, you're needed. Someone ordered the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh and Fluzzy Special. Look, I'm not like Rick, so you're free to do as you please. But there comes a time in every man's life when he must choose the foundation on which his legacy will be built... One of compromise or one of blood. ♪ Once a time of year, there's a special person here ♪ Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Oops! Okay, a little more on the other side then. Oh, come on! Oh, geez! Aah! Stop! So, the hospital just let you walk right out of there with horse parts in a bag? For Christ's sakes, Morty, women going through a divorce need a creative outlet. What was that? Summer! I'm coming, Summer! What the hell happened?! How do we get her back to normal?! I don't know, man! This thing is pretty complicated. I-I'm gonna call Rick. Well, hold on. We can't just call your grandpa whenever there's a problem. We can handle this ourselves. I mean, I don't see the point in trying to. This is obviously Rick-level shit. I have a medical degree. Is that what this is about? L-Like, you want to prove yourself? Oh, it's not about anything, Morty. How dare you? Okay, good. Then I'll just call... Ow! Morty, I need this. Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here says he knows a place where the ladies drop panties for anyone bi-pedal. Yeah, I'm not really interested. My heart still belongs to Beth. Oh. Huh. Okay. What, you don't think I have a shit? I didn't say that. Excuse me. May I have another one of these? Coming right up. Hmm, things weren't always so bad between Beth and me. We had some good times when we were younger. Oh, yeah, I bet. That's how teenage pregnancy happens, my friend. Yeah, no. Things were pretty great, even until a couple of years ago. Jerry, I get it. That's around the time I moved in with you guys. Oh, I guess you're right. Jerry, you know, I hope you're not suggesting that I had anything to do with your marriage breaking up, because there are some major issues between you and Beth that have been there since you guys met. Hey, to new beginnings. To the Whirly Dirly. The Whirly Dirly? All right, what's going on here? When did you get cool?! When you stole my wife! I should have done that a long time ago! We're going on the Whirly Dirly! Whirly Dirly, baby. Aha, look at this. It says ""normalize."" I bet if we just press that... But... if the machine was made by spider people, normal would mean eight legs. Oh, God! Are you gonna go on another spiel like you did with the flesh-colored crayon? I'm pretty sure ""normalize"" will make her normal. Aah! I'd call that progress. She's huge! And normal! I'm not normal! Mom! Okay, this says ""reverse."" Done and done. I don't think that's a good idea. Oh, come on! What else could ""reverse"" possibly mean? Aah! Mom, call Rick! Thank you. There's a customer-service number on here. Mom! Oh, man. This is gonna be awesome! I got to hand it to you, Jerry. This was a solid idea. Uh, yeah. Uh-huh. And you know what? I'll cop to it. I put a lot of strain on your marriage. It wasn't fair. I'm sorry. What?! I didn't respect your marriage. I certainly didn't do it any favors. And for what it's worth, I'll apologize to Beth for it when we get home. Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah! Stop the ride! We got to get off. What are you talking about, buddy? We got to get out of this thing. We got to get out! Jerry, come on, man! We haven't even gotten to the first whirly. No, no, this sucks. It's so boring. I mean, I'm falling asleep here. Let's just get out and crawl down the sides. Uh, get down! Duck down! It's more fun when you scrunch down. Jerry, what the... Oh shit! Rick, up here! There's a spot where you can kill him! Good call, Jerry! Hey, how'd you know about that? Uh... Lisa? So, uh, Jerry, big fan of the Whirly Dirly, are you? Not anymore. Obviously. But when you were, how did you know about it? We had a deal, Jerry Smith. It's a really common name. Now, take it easy, Rick. You've been in a serious roller-coaster crash. It's... It's no time to be thinking about who did or didn't play a role in your attempted murder. Get it off me! It's eating me! Look, I confess, okay? They told me about all the bad stuff you did to this planet and reminded me of all the bad stuff you did to me. But then you said you were sorry, and I realized you're not a monster... Not like this thing. f*ck It's got me good. This is a mislead, right? You're inventing a thing to save me. That would be called a knife, Jerry. It's been invented. I'm making a way out of here... One seat ought to do it. I'm sorry. I-I made a mistake. I won't do it again! Nobody ever does. You self-righteous piece of shit. You took my family! I took your family? Who do you think had more taken from them when you shit ccs of liquid kill into my daughter? She was Rick's daughter, Jerry. She had options! Oof. That all ended because she felt sorry for you. You act like prey, but you're a predator! You use pity to lure in your victims! That's how you survive! I survive because I know everything. That snakes survives because children wander off, and you survive because people think, ""Oh, this poor piece of shit. He never gets a break."" I can't stand the deafening silent wails of his wilting soul. ""I guess I'll hire him or marry him."" - Rick! - Rick! I knew you wouldn't let me die. That was never an option. Because you never had a son. No, because I need a living organism coated in gibble snake bile to attract a shmooglite runner. Wait, what's happening? Use that confusion, Jerry. It'll make you wriggle more like an abandoned newborn. Jesus Christ! What the f*ck Rick?! Help! Help me! Aaah! There's a space port miles south. We'll be able to board a galaxy class cruise ship and jump through a wormhole that will put us within spitting distance of the Milky Way. But, hey, it's about the journey, not the destination, right, Jerry? Just stay put, sweetie! Mom's still on hold. Morphizer customer service. How may I help you? Yes, I'm having a little trouble with one of your machines. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am. Do you see a little compartment on the side of the machine? Let me check. Yes, got it. Mom? Great! Now, do you see the little button next to it? I do. Give that button a push. Okay. Mom, listen to me! We're free!! Okay, so I pushed the button, and three little men ran out. What do I do next? Hello? I think we got disconnected. Morty! Don't ""Morty"" me! I tricked Rick into taking Dad on an adventure because I thought I could get a break from this kind of shit but no! Like father, like g*dd*mn daughter! You want to be like Rick, congratulations! You're just as arrogant and just as irresponsible! Everything okay here? Mind your own g*dd*mn business, Gene! I'm having a conversation with my mother here! Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna help him keep him around, Mom, but it will help you lose everyone else. Like I lost Summer. Hey, you haven't lost her yet. No, I definitely did. She's gone. God damn it! Go ahead. Oh, come on. What's happening? Your friend is class C or above cybernetic augmentations. Emphasis on the above. In any case, he needs to be neutralized. What?! Wait! Ugh! Brain hurty. What did you do? It's a synaptic dampener that blocks violent tendencies and controversial thought. He will now be an ideal passenger. I want cookies and a -minute cut of ""Avatar."" Seriously? Quit it. It'll wear off in six hours. It's cheaper than banning dangerous people from flights. I mean, let everybody buy a ticket, right? Otherwise, the t*rrorists win. Aah! I'm sorry I'm not a classic maternal archetype. Okay, I don't know what to do when you people come to me with your weird puberty issues. What are you gonna do when your daughter asks you if she's attractive? I'll say ""yes""! Morty, gross! Well, she's gonna be super hot. Her mother's gonna be Jessica... Wait, when did Summer ask you that?! Right before she Clive Barkered herself. Why? Wait, I know where she is! Ethan and Summer were supposed to go camping, and then he dumped Summer for this girl, Tricia Lange, who's got huge boobies and took her. Campsite... The one with the name that sounds like somebody gave up halfway through naming it. Uh... Camp Flabanabba! Mama's coming, baby. Mama's coming, and she cares about your titties! They have sweet smiggle honey cookies. Mmm! And low-calorie petroleum flakes. Obviously cookies. Let's get you the flakes then. Okay, but it's not what I wanted. Well, maybe next time, you won't be such a dumb piece of shit and you can pick for yourself. That's not nice. What's that? Did you just have a controversial thought? No. That's what I thought, bitch. You little punk-ass. This is the best. I agree. You've made things even easier than if you hadn't been incompetent. Uh-oh. We get sh**t now. All right, folks, if you could please take your seats, we're about to enter the wormhole. So, I hope everybody bought it dinner first. Nice. Nice. Jerry, step over there and lock yourself in the escape pod. You're not kill us? I'm kill Rick. You're free to go. You're no threat to me or anyone. Now you're just being mean. Yeah, you're mean... No offense. Mean would be sh**ting you, Jerry. This is saving a b*llet. Go back to your quietly ashamed family and live out the rest of your days in denial of your vagina fantasies. It was a one-time thought that everyone has! What are you doing? I'm being triumphantly brave! It's not triumphant or brave. You're not risking anything. You might sh**t me. I think you know I won't. Because you know I feel sorry for you. You're just doing this so you can tell yourself you fought... Ow! Temporal shield compromised. Congratulations, Jerry. You get to die a man. Uh, that's okay! I'll leave! Please don't sh**t. I-I'm the vagina guy, remember? Whoa! What is happening to me? Where is this? Where am I? Am I dead? A-Am I... Am I still alive? Those aren't the questions you should be asking. Huh?! Shh! Ah, got ya! Come here, you little pumpkin. I have shit on my ass. Whoa, oof this! Who am I? Who am I? I'm time! I'm literally time! Whooooa! Aah! Oh, God. I feel like our souls were united, and we were all one with eternity. Our body's unchanged, yet our minds have lived a thousand lifetimes. Is that enough time for me to forgive you? I don't know, but it's enough time for a synaptic dampener to wear off. He hadn't decided he was still going to kill us! He was talking himself into it. I've seen it before. Cosmic apotheosis wears off faster than salvia. I'm starting to believe you because I just finished merging with your essence for an endless epoch, and I'm already back to thinking you're an assh*le. Fine with me. Let's just go our separate ways. Sounds like you and the word ""epoch"" have a lot of catching up to do. Wait, don't leave me! All right, folks, you're free to get up and walk around the cabin and maybe take the wormhole out for breakfast. Okay, you can do the dinner one or the breakfast one, but not both. You think you got that thing figured out? Yeah, I know what I'm doing. Good. Because I have an idea. It's actually a contraction of ""some"" and ""more,"" you see that? Oh, wow. I was way off. Morty, what's happening here? Summer got into my grandpa's garage, messed around, and turned herself into a monster. My mom did the same to make her feel better. She's a good mom. Oh, my God. I have to go call my mother! Tricia, wait! Ethan! Ethan! Hey, it's okay. Sit down. You made my sister cry, Ethan. You messed with her body image. Look, Morty, I... Shh, shh, shh. Careful, Ethan. Your s'more is burning. Uh, I guess we better get on the same page about our fake adventure. Right. I'll make you a deal. I'll leave out the part where you tried to murder me... And I'll leave out the part where you admitted to sabotaging our marriage. You want to...? Nah, if the family sees me like this, they'll feel sorry for me. Which is no longer my signature move. Later days, amigo. Actually, I just realized, I don't have my wallet, and my bus pass is in there, so maybe... Stay strong, Jerry. I believe in you! I tell you, fellas. This is the life. It certainly is. To freedom! Ooh! Looks like a - . Ooh, a couple cranks on scaling knob with a four dilabyte cross fade would fix that in a jiff. Four? You'd be lucky to clear % de-morphized with that kind of range. Gentlemen, gentlemen, what did we agree on? No work talk! Let's just relax and enjoy our retirement, shall... Oh, my God! Aaah!"

I'm healthy enough to admit that! That kid is a real piece of [BLEEP]. Y-Y-You're gonna save me, right? Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty. Part of me really wanted to. [CAR HORN BEEPS] I'm telling you, these shares are hot. Yeah. That sounds like a good idea. It's definitely a good idea. Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me? Have I ever lied to you? That's right, and ask around, I never do, Duane. Let me put this real simple. This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single, not looking to date but ready to fall in love, and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane... two lockers down. So step up or step off, Duane. Blue pill or red pill, what'll be, bro? Totally understand, Duane. You're the boss. [PHONE BEEPS] Heinholz Biotech... million and a half at thirty-three.

Look, can we just talk for a minute? Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location? Come back, Morty. I miss you. You miss the old me. You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love 'em back. How do you know I don't want to love you? Because I'm not sick. Ex-girlfriend? Should I be jealous? There's nothing to be jealous of. I just realized that I'm scheduled to speak at that fundraiser on our date night. I can cancel. We'll be together. That's a date. You are the perfect man. Oh, sweetie, I think you hit the wrong button. You didn't hang up. Huh. How 'bout that? [GLASS SHATTERS] [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] Sorry, tiny American Psycho, time to take the op[BURPS]posite of your medicine. Do what you got to do. [SCREAMS] Oh! Ow! Ahh! So, how do you feel, Morty? Ah, geez. I'm miserable. Am I good or what? I guess it's worth it, though, to know how much you care. Care? Me? Morty, I'm fine with you. I only did this for him. You lying bitch. She kept coming to our house, Morty, and kept asking me ""Did... did... d-did you get a new Morty yet?"" Because you kept drunk dialing me and crying about it. I wasn't crying! [RICK AND JESSICA BICKER] Jacquelyn, I... I... I... I wasn't who I said I was. You weren't a -year-old boy from the Midwest who ran away from his family and capitalized on his lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker? Oh. I guess I was pretty up front about that, wasn't I? You were up front about everything. You were my soul mate. Well... N... Not anymore. I'll, um... Y-You can keep the apartment, and... and... and, uh... the drones. She can't keep the drones. They turn into a little Voltron robot. They're awesome. [ELECTRICAL WHIRRING] You can't keep the drones. [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] So, how was your date with Brad? It wasn't a date. We were just having lunch. You guys are getting back together, aren't you? Morty, I need your help on an adventure. Eh, ""need"" is a strong word. We need door stops, but a brick would work, too.

27,3,7,The Ricklantis Mixup,"All right, Morty, you ready for our adventure to the Lost City of Atlantis? Ready as I'll ever be, Rick. Oh, for f*ck's sake. Hello, I'm Rick K- . This is my Morty. We're going from reality to reality asking Ricks to contribute to the Citadel of Ricks Redevelopment Fund. What are you, stupid? We're done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was never on board with it in the first place. That's why I murder everyone in charge and left it to rot. Oh, that was you. They tried to murder him first. Aw, geez. Well, you'll be happy to know that the council's gone now... Yeah, he knows. He murder them. You want to rein in your Morty? Every day. The Citadel of Ricks Redevelopment Fund- - donates. - Morty, he's not gonna donate. You're pitching the Policeman's Ball to a black teenager here. Let's go. You don't have to be a dick. I think you know that's not true. Geez. I didn't know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like. Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on a fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis. Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas. Man, I'm glad I'm not one of them! ♫ Somewhere out on that horizon ♫ ♫ Out beyond the neon lights ♫ I know there must be somethin' better ♫ ♫ But there's nowhere else in sight ♫ ♫ It's survival in the city ♫ When you live from day to day ♫ ♫ City streets don't have much pity ♫ ♫ When you're down, that's where you'll stay ♫ Citadel Morning News. News about the Citadel in the morning, pretty self explanatory. Good morning. I'm Rick D- B. And I'm Rick D- . Must be nice. Coming up, gravity outages in East Sanchez Heights... And, is your uranium-powered cellular matrix making you sick? The answer may not surprise you. It's... Yes, it's uranium. Those stories and more, after this break. iterations off the central finite curve, there's a Rick that works more with wood than polarity plating. His name is Simple Rick but he's no dummy. He realized long ago that the greatest thing he'd ever create was his daughter. I love Daddy! We captured that moment... We run it on a loop through Simple Rick's mind... And the chemical it makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Rick's ""Simple Wafers"" Wafer Cookie. Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick's. Just one day remains before our newly democratic Citadel elects its first President, it's anyone's race among the Rick candidates. But a certain other candidate should be getting at least one vote for most adorable. That's right. The Morty party candidate's still in the race, and you just gotta love him for that. Here you see him in his little Morty suit waving... Isn't that adorable? Little jackass. Uh, yeah, I think we actually have the audio for his speech here... Aw, geez. Aw, man. I'm gonna lose the election and stuff. We had a good run, sir, but I think it's time to pull out of the race. I feel pretty confident about tonight's debate. You shouldn't, sir. You should be terrified. Maybe you should find a little faith, young man. You don't pay me to have faith. And we're the same age! - Aah! - Whoa! Oh. Sorry. I-I was expecting... A Rick partner? Lesson one, rookie, expect the unexpected. Now, get in. Mortys are human! Get the f*ck off the car, you Rickless f*ck' animal! Whoa! The election's got these yellow shirts more riled up than a picture-day Jessica. That's pretty harsh, sir. So report me. Nobody gives a f*ck. Look, I'm just saying, it makes me a little sad to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys animals. Well, it makes me sad to hear another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training. Well, I'm glad to know there's more like me. Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty? Robbery at Fifth and Avenue. Fifth and. That's Morty Town. Unit seven responding. Ohh! Good idea, Rick. Good idea, Rick. This is a great adventure. This is a great adventure. I love being your new Morty. I love being your new Mor... Farty. Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first Rick was decapitated on Zorpantheon Nine. Or was that your third Rick? How many Ricks have you had? Five. I see. So you are top of the class in something. Tomorrow you'll be transferred to your new Ricks. Hopefully they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri... Tall Morty? Di... did I gradgitate this time yet? Anything's possible, Tall Morty. I guess we won't be seeing each other after this, huh? I say we make our last day count. I say... we go to the Wishing Portal. That's a myth. It's not a myth. My first Rick's fourth Morty knew a Rick whose Morty went there. If we're not here for graduation, our butts are gonna wind up in Morty Town. I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard, not a chicken. Okay, fine. I'm in. Me too. What the hell?! I thought I saw a fly. Listen up, f*ck nuts. I've been your supervisor for five years, but all shitty things must come to an end and I have been promoted to regional manager. Yeah, I feel the same way, may be never meet again. Of course, that makes the position of supervisor available, so, as of next week, the ass you'll be kissing will be that of... K- , affectionately known as Cool Rick. I know I'm new to the Citadel, and some of you might not think I put in my time, but what can I say? I'm Cool Rick! Yo! Ha! Ha! Check me out! All right knuckleheads, any questions? All right, then, back to work, you gold rickers. No Ricks, no families, high off their asses, and running amuck. Mortys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, hey just start kicking. They were... They were about my height, around years old... oh, their... their shirts were yellow! Yeah, make sure you get that down. Any mutations, augmentations? Uh... Three eyes? A tail? Maybe a buzz cut? No. Just four normal Mortys. Normal? Put it in your blog. Let me turn over a few rocks. Aw, geez. Hey, what's goin' on, fellas? Aw, geez, man. Nothing, man. We're just hanging out and stuff. I hear that. Aw, geez. I guess I'm supposed to be figurin' out who robbed the store across the street. But, aw, geez, I don't know. Aw, geez man, that sucks that your Rick's making you do that. He's not my Rick. He's my partner. Aw, geez. Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference, who am I to say. To me, you just look like a sidekick. Whoa! Call me a sidekick one more time! Call me a sidekick! Hey, man! Come on! Aw, geez! Wanna see how I paint a wall?! It was the Morty Town Locos, man! The... The Morty Town Locos! Aah! Aah! Do you realize how many codes you just violated? Aw, geez, Rick. What do I know about knowin' stuff? Get in the f*ck' car. More lasers. You could take more time to answer the question if you like. Okay, Juggling Rick, how would you solve the Citadel's financial crisis? First off, can I just say that I believe this Citadel is the greatest in the entire multi-verse. Now, I believe the answer to your question has three parts. First, education spending must get much higher... But it has to be balanced with defense... Whoa! Whoa! Can we fact check this please? Never mind. Who am I kidding. This race is over. And that's how you run a Citadel! Candidate Morty, the number of displaced Mortys is soaring while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting, and the divide between the two groups has never been wider. Solve that one real quick. I don't see a divide between Ricks and Mortys... Oh, shocker. I'd like to offer a re-buttal. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I think we can all agree on one thing... Well, it came out as two things but you get the idea. You guys finished? The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided... and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go. I see it in our schools where they teach Mortys we're all the same, because they're threatened by what makes us unique. I see it in our streets where they give gun to Mortys, so we're too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice. I see it in our factories where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss' salary even though they're identical and have the same IQ. The Citadel's problem isn't homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks. The Citadel's problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadel's death... Holy Shit! He's headed for the flavor core! But I've got a message for them,from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive, a message from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that don't. You're outnumbered. Holy Shit. I don't believe it. I-I ca believe it. I know. That's why you're fired. Sounds like you're looking for work. I can offer you a very enticing compensation package. First, let's talk benefits... Daddy loves you. That's Daddy's good girl. Your life is a lie, man. All your life's are lies! All your life's are lies! Don't you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Ricks, but they stripped us of everything that made us unique! We know how you feel. We're working-stiff Ricks just like you. But our assembly line is justice. What are your demands? I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this God damn prison! The media's outside. Well, keep 'em there. Anyway, so yeah, the suspect says the Citadel's a lie, built on lies, and some other shit. I say appreciate the life you have, because it can always be worse. Back to you, Ricks. Thank you, Rick -C. That f*ck' guy. Tell me about it. Meanwhile, in election news, an unexpected turn of events as Morty from the Morty Party soars to the top of the polls. - Morty! Morty! Morty! - Yes. Morty, what's your original reality and where's your Rick? Gosh, we moved around so much it's hard to remember. I see every Rick as my Rick, I hope they see me as their Morty. Another? Please? With less water? Hey, cheer up, pal. A Morty's gonna be president. Imagine this kisser getting blamed for everything. I guess I should've had more faith. It's not faith you need. It's fear. What's this? It's secrets. Wh... wh... wh... What do you think it is? Look at how I'm dressed. Having taken aim at the system, are afraid at all for your safety? I'd rather live in hope than fear. If I had to fear anything, I'd fear other people being afraid. Of fear. Itself. But. No, I'm not afraid. Hey, Rick, man, when there's a Morty president, you gonna lick my balls or what? Sheeeet, grandson, you keep me peelin' skrabquams and slippin' nib nibs, I'll lick whatever ain't nailed down. Hands in the air! What the hell, man?! What the hellin' hell? You guys doing a little chemistry homework with Grandpa? Is this what I think it is? Bootleg portal fluid. I guess his math was off. Search the place. Are... are you... my new... R... Rick? It's okay, Morty. Jesus. He stabbed me. He got me bad, Morty. Shh. It's okay. You're okay. You were right. Everything I learned at the academy was... Doesn't matter. Nothing's wrong with putting your faith in a Morty. You just gotta pick the right one. Why is there a crib in here? Something they do. To make you feel bad. Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh? Go to the car and grab a medi-pack. Let me worry about this. What happened? Same old story... Mortys kill Mortys. Almost... got it... Hey! Y'all get the hell away from my damn mega fruit! Sic 'em, boy! I don't wear this dag-nab hat and commit to this rural character so you can eat for free while you come of age! I bet the Wishing Portal leads to a reality where they're... Where all... Where it's a bunch of French toast with boobies. I bet it leads to a place with a bunch of fry... Fly... flies everywhere. Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet it's a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams. Slick, why do you have to be so dramatic? You wanna know why? Because of this. I'm part of an experimental line of Mortys with a drama implant. How do you think it feels, Fat Morty, to know that no matter where I go, I'll always be the one that makes everybody sad and a little bored. Slick, that implant isn't who you are, okay? You also roll up your sleeves. I thought I was Left-Handed Morty. Then you should use your left hand to eat more vegetables. Hey, there. How you doing? Great to meet you. I'm a plumber, sir. I'm a Rick, and I'm a plumber. That doesn't sound like Rick work. You didn't come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you? Ha! Ha! I sure didn't, sir! Mr. Morty! Mr. Morty! I cloned myself so you could kiss me as a baby! This is just like a Morty baby! Hey, did you, uh, end up getting a new job? Yeah, I did. Assassinating you. I'm okay... I'm okay... I'm... Aw, man. Aw, geez. Aw, hah. You look like you could use a good time. One dance for $ , two for $ . No, thank you... And bad math. Ha! Ha! Yeah! This is a good time! What is this place? The Creepy Morty. What is it your kind's always saying... ""Don't think about it."" Come on. There's someone important I want you to meet. Ah, Bubbala! How'd it go with the Morty Town Locos? They had a little accident. They won't be causing any trouble anymore. Those were bad Mortys. Very bad Mortys. Big Morty likes to contribute to keeping the peace in Morty Town. Think of him as a ""drug lord"" and us as cops on his payroll. Morty... - Which Morty? - Which Morty? M... m... my partner. Morty, you're right. Morty Town is bad. But that doesn't mean that we have to be. Hey, what's going on here, Morty? - Which Morty? - Which Morty? The cop, morons! Don't worry about Rick, Big Morty. He's new. He doesn't understand how it works. That's what you said about your last partner. Why would you say something like that, Big Morty? You're f*ck' things up for both of us here. Wrong. He's f*ck' things up for both of you. Unless he takes the money. Big Morty, you're under arrest. S... smartest man in the universe. They're just props! Th... they're just props! Not so big now, are ya? I never was! It was figurative! That's enough. If we don't kill him, he'll talk. If you do, I'll talk. O... one thing's for sure, Y... y'all don't have to worry about Cowboy Morty talkin'. This little cowpoke's gonna mosey up on out of here. You told me to put my faith in the right Morty. I've got faith in you, partner. Do the right thing. Oh, Grandpa Rick, I-I don't wanna be on the Citadel anymore. I wanna be a regular kid. I-I wanna to go to school and throw balls around and masturbate. What the hell happened in there? Same old story. Ricks kill Mortys. Okay, man, okay, we got your portal gun. What the hell's he doing? Where... where am I? A bad place. But you're going to a better one soon. Hey! Hey! No, no, no, no... Whaa... God damn it! A portal to the blender dimension? That's the oldest trick in the book! I'm a Rick! I'm more Rick than any of you! Then you should know you just kill your only leverage! Then comes and get me, f*ck! Stop. I'm Rick D. Sanchez the Third, owner of this here wafer establishment, and I say that the Rick in there is right. He's more Rick than any of you. He's a t*rror1st! What Rick isn't?! This Citadel was founded by Ricks for Ricks to be free! What's your name, young man? Rick. And I'm... The same age as me, I know. How long have you worked here? years. What the hell have we become? Whatever time you were gonna make him serve, he's served it. It ends now. Come with me, friend. Where are we going? To your new life. Which starts with walking the f*ck out of here. Yo J- , give 'em hell! There's a Rick that held a factory hostage after murder his boss and several coworkers. The factory made cookies, flavored them with lies. He made us all take a look at what we were doing. And in the bargain, he got a taste of real freedom. We captured that taste, and we keep giving it to him so he give it right back to you, in every bite of new. Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects. Come home to the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. Come home to Simple Rick. It is real. After you. There it is. The Wishing Portal. They say for your wish to come true, you have to give up something really important. For me, that's my panini maker. I wish for a million sandwiches. And, yes, I see the irony. I guess I wish I had something cooler than this dumbass surfer necklace. I wish incest p*rn had... Had a more mainstream appeal. For... For a friend of mine. None of those things are gonna happen, you know. Morty wishes never come true. Not on the Citadel. Then why did you bring us here? Because I wish that would change. I wish anything about this life would change. Well, I hope you're putting something pretty God damn important in there. Me too. But I doubt it. - No! - Slick! M... maybe... maybe it went somewhere nice. Garbage dump. Stand back. He had to be stopped. He... he cou... he c... Couldn't be allowed to win. Then you should've worked on your aim, bro. He's alive? No, no, no. You gotta listen to me. I-I worked for him. I was his campaign manager. That Morty is not what he seems. Yeah, well, no Morty seems like a president. He... won? Yeah. It was a blow out. I would hardly call it a blow out. It was almost close enough to trigger a recount. Jesus. What are you joke security now too? Why am I still here? I heard he confessed to everything. Your case has been reviewed. You're free to go. But... I violated at least a dozen departmental codes. New department. New codes. New Citadel. Did we miss graduation? Where are the new Ricks? No graduation. No new Ricks. The school's curriculum is changing. To what? I don't know, and I don't have to know. I've been fired. Good luck, turds. Holy crap. Slick's wish came true. Sorry I'm late, Mr. President. Had a little crisis at work. Worth it! It's no problem. Uh, a little more off the top. You were saying, Garment District Rick. We were saying, ""President"" Morty, that we don't care who sits in that seat. A Rick, a Morty, a god damn Jerry... It doesn't matter. We've been running the Citadel since before the council and you'll find that we're still running it now. Does he really speak for everyone here? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Well, I think it's important to be clear. Raise your hand if he speaks for you. Is... that enough off the top? I don't know. Is it? - Yes, yes, god damn, yes. - I think it's great. Good. This seems like a good time for a drink and a cold calculated speech with sinister overtones. A speech about politics... About order... Brotherhood... ...Power. But speeches are for campaigning. Now is the time for action. ♫ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♫ ♫ Ah, ah-ah ♫ ♫ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♫ ♫ Ah, ah-ah ♫ ♫ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♫ ♫ Ah, ah-ah ♫ ♫ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♫ ♫ Ah, ah-ah ♫ Whoo! Yeah! Atlantis, baby! That was amazing. You got some of that mermaid puss. I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um, you're still not curious about what what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place? Psh. Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Whoo! Yeah! We're going back for seconds! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis! Oh, shit!"

We've got a bunch of Froopyland procedural carbons all gummed up and mixed in with real human DNA. Are you saying Tommy survived here by having sex with Froopy creatures, creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring, and then consuming their proteins, sustaining himself with an endless cycle of cannibalistic incest? It's just a working theory. Of course, if that's the case, I expect he'd be worshiped as a kind of god by a medieval-level society of his least-delicious children. Halt! You are now prisoners of our exalted ruler, giver and taker of life, helper and consumer of mortality, dispenser of life... Yes, if I could interrupt? We're way ahead of the reveal here. Yeah, just take us to King Tommy. I thought warrior priestesses could only leave Krootabulon on a hunt. Mmm. Thank you, sweetie. I hope it's not human season. I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix. I would never hunt a human. Your father and I are soul-bonded. Soul-bonded? Um, does your planet have shorter days, because you guys are moving kind of fast, no? [ Sniffing ] [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Whoosh ] Go get him, honey! She's always hunting. [ Chuckles ] She probably knew a Varrix worked here, and that's why she said the Yelp reviews didn't matter. Dad, do you understand how serious Krootabulon soul-bonding is? Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know. It's got such a casual name. If you want to lecture anyone about commitment, start with your mom. Oh, my God. Dad, is that what this is about? Are you rushing into a new thing to get back at Mom? Every weekend, you two have told me to move on. Move on, like, out of bed. Like, stop using paper towels for toilet paper, not move on into a sloppy rebound. Dad, you need to slow down, rethink this soul bond. Why don't you just say what you really mean? You think it's cool that having sex with her gives me telekinesis and you recognize she's got a hot bod like Cheetara in ""Thundercats,""but you're grossed out by her avocado-shaped head and blue skin, and you think I want to put a bag and a wig on her head. After all the time and energy I spent teaching you two about race... [ Varrix screams ] ...you ended up r*cist. [ Whoosh ] Soon your world will be rid of Varrix. Tomorrow, we celebrate. We could take the kids to the water park. We celebrate with a hunt! Ooh. You kids want to hunt? - Yes. - Yes. [ Trumpet fanfare ] All kneel for King Tommy! I'm not kneeling. Suck my dick. Well, hello, all! I am the King of Froopyland, but I go by another name, too. We know. It's Tommy! - We know. - We know. I have lived here since I was a mere child. - We know. - Got it. I suppose you're wondering, how do I sustain myself? - Oh, boy. - No, we aren't. I always find the theater is the best way to clarify things. - Ugh. - Seriously? Oh, my God. Players, go! I am little Tommy. [ Crowd cheers ] I am tiny Beth. [ Crowd boos ] Oh, come on. Come with me to a magic land. Froopy: Don't do it! This is my secret Froopyland where I have no rules! I am excited. I am jealous of Tommy's friends and his Nintendo and his dad who likes him. I take it Tommy wasn't class playwright. You want to see the Honey Swamp? Yes! Let's do it! Well, I want to see you dead. Ow, help! I'm stuck! I'm covered in honey. Huh. Well, that's interesting. Fake news. Many nights have passed, trapped in this strange land. I am hungry, and all I can do to pass the time is hump. I will hump this rock. [ Tapping ] I will hump this tree. [ Tapping ] I will hump this beast of the land and put my seed in it. [ Tapping ] I am the first of Tommy's children. Eat of my flesh so you may survive. And so I did. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. Certified fresh. Good... Good job. Perhaps a demonstration is in order.

[ Splorch ] All right, that's it. I'm outta here. What are you doing? We're in the middle of an adventure. Here's some things an adventure needs, Beth. Conflict, stakes, a way for me to benefit, and, clearly, Morty. But Tommy's still in there, raping Muppets and eating babies. Yep. Luckily, that's not our problem. Time to pull the plug. Pull the plug? We have to get Tommy out of there, okay? We... We need to do the right thing. Do what you never did as a dad... Put in a little effort. All right, cut the high-road routine. We both saw Tommy's shitty play. You pushed him in the Honey Swamp, Beth. His very happy life is in your hands. You go save him from it. [ Scoffs ] You're gonna believe a play over your own daughter? Yes, I am, Beth, because you're not my own daughter. Oh, God, yes. I'm one of infinite Beths with infinite fathers in infinite universes. It's called a hug, Dad. It won't kill you. Yeah, don't be so sure. You know why all Ricks made a Froopyland for all their little girls? Same reason I wasn't surprised by Tommy's overwritten, badly structured, cheaply produced flashback. You were a scary f*ck' kid, man. [ Scoffing ] Oh, my God. I didn't make Froopyland to get rid of you, Beth. I did it to protect the neighborhood. Not in a [burps] noble sense. It was just more practical to sequester you before I had to start, you know, cloning a replacement for every less-than-polite little boy or gullible animal that might cross your socio-path. You would rather believe I'm evil than admit that you were a bad father? Oh, dude, no. No, bad father all the way to the max over here. I'm a f*ck' nutcase. And the acorn plopped straight down, baby. Look at some of this shit you were asking me to make you as a kid. Ray gun. A whip that forces people to like you. Invisibility cuffs, a parent trap, a lightning gun, a teddy bear with anatomically correct innards, night-vision googly-eye glasses, sound-erasing sneakers, false fingerprints, fall-asleep darts, a lie-detecting doll, an indestructible baseball bat, a Taser shaped like a ladybug, a fake police badge, location-tracking stickers, rainbow-colored duct tape, mind-control hair clips, poison gum, a pink, sentient switchblade. Hi, Beth, you've gotten taller. Shall we resume stabbing? Has it occurred to you that I asked you to make those things because I wanted you to spend time with me? Has it occurred to you that if I did try kill Tommy, it might be because I was jealous of his family? Wait, what? Why? Wasn't his dad, like, some kind of cannibal? Seems like it must be hereditary. Oh, my God. This is your fault. I am not a bad person. I'm gonna go back in there, I'm getting Tommy, and I'm fixing this! Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin. [ Jingling ] I don't know why I just said that. Doesn't make a lot of sense, but gotta stand by it. Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin. I'm owning it. [ Ax swings ] Morty: No, Dad! You're not doing it right! [ Ax swings ] Cutting off their heads isn't doing it right? They're [grunts] clearly regenerative! I-I think you have to stab them through the heart or something. You think or you know? I thought you were the alien expert, Isaac Asi-hole. Don't snap at me! I'm tired! - Me, too! - We're all tired! [ Ax swings ] [ Whoosh ] [ Grunts ] That's the last of them. Tonight, we celebrate. With a hunt? Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt. [ Rain trickling ] [ Clears throat ] I, uh, really have to get out of this soul bond. - What the f*ck, Dad? - Oh, my God! Duh! - Obviously! - Yeah, no kidding! Can you guys help me? What? How? Can I just, uh, tell her it's because of my kids? You know, like, you don't like the shape of her head, or... That's you, Dad! That's you! You're a baby and an idiot! I think that's been established, Summer. Now help me! First, I want you to admit that you're a closet r*cist, a beta-male sexist, and you dragged everyone into a horrible situation by only thinking of yourself. Okay. I want to hear you say it. [ Sighs deeply ] Look, I'm a closeted r*cist, and I'm sexist and selfish, and I dragged us all into my sexist, r*cist bad things because I'm stupid. Thank you. Now you're gonna help me, right? She just did. Yeah, clean up your own mess. Wait, wait, what? Oh, man. [ Trumpet fanfare ] Tommy: All right, everybody. Next item on the docket... I would like to have sex with some of you, and then eat the babies. [ Froopys murmuring ] I thought you'd like that. I do keep rolling out the hits, don't I? [ Bang ] Oh! It's the Magic Crayon Lady! Are you hungry? I was just about to make dinner. And by ""make dinner,"" I mean... Tommy, I'm going to take you to the real world. Well, this is the real world. No, you don't understand! Your dad... Uh, people think your dad ate you! So? You doy-oy! People should eat people. Just leave me alone! Tommy, you don't understand. I have to make this right because it's my fault that you're in here. I'm Beth. [ All gasp ] - Beth? - The destroyer! The destroyer! Oh, suck it up, Princess Incest. You fell into some honey. Well, it tends to happen when one is pushed into honey. I respect your right to believe I pushed you. Oh, do I get to have that? Is my reality like a little side of fries... a little Kwanzaa you're willing to slide my way? Yes, because I'm focused on saving your father's life because I'm not a petty piece of shit. So, then, it should be pretty easy to say, ""Sorry I pushed you."" Real easy and not necessary, since you coming home will save your dad's life whereas nothing is changed by anyone stroking your batshit-crazy ego. Sorry, forgive me. Uh, I've been in Froopyland for quite a while. Have apologies changed? Tommy, I'm sorry you think you deserve an apology. Oh, my God. I'm my father. Uh, will someone just kill this B-word?

Hi, I need to pull Morty out of school. Come on, Morty. Ha! You heard your daddy, Morty. You have to leave school. Wait, what are my values? Dad, what's going on? We're going to Alaska. What? Why? It's nice there. Also, I broke up with Kiara, and she didn't take it well, and she wants to murder you two. What? Th-Then why are we walking? I'm walking because I'm tired. You guys should definitely run. [ Whoosh ] [ Screams ] [ Thud ] Excuse me, I just... You know what? I'm... I'm just gonna go left. No, okay, your left, that's fine. Do you know what left is, 'cause... Ugh! What does your breakup have to do with us? [ Engine starts ] Yeah, we chose Mom hands down. I thought we made that clear at the lawyer's office and in the comments under your weird rant on Facebook. [ Crash ] [ Tires squeal ] She kind of blames you guys for the breakup. - Why? - Why?

That I'm not that great a guy and you're exactly like me. Am I evil? Worse. You're smart. When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. And I've never met a universe that was into it. The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them, not unlike your friend Timmy. Tommy. Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it'll never stop trying to throw you. And, eventually, it will. There's no other way off. Dad, I'm out of excuses to not be who I am. So who am I? What do I do? My advice... Take off. Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out. I can't do that. The kids, Jerry, my job, and, as much as I hate to admit it, ABC's ""The Bachelor."" I can make a clone of you, a perfect instance of you, with all your memories. An exact copy in every way. It'll love and provide for the kids, do your job, and consume broadcast-network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic level as you. You could be gone a day, a week, or the rest of your life with zero consequences. The moment you decide to come back, I flip a switch, and the clone's job is done. It feels no pain, it regrets nothing, and has zero chance of going ""Blade Runner."" If nothing matters, why would you do that for me? I don't know, maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you. Maybe something about your mother. Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth. I don't know if I can do it. Then stay, and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you've chosen. My secret bonus is that no matter what you choose, you're finally gonna chill the f*ck out. Okay. I know what I want to do. [ Whoosh ] Aah! [ Thud ] Ow! You can't run forever! She's really pissed off. I know. It's kinda hot. Shut up! The hunters! They're back! Run! - We're not hunters. - We want to hide with you. We're not hiding. We're nesting. Ooh la la. [ All scream ] The children must be destroyed so that we can be together. You need to break up with her, Dad... properly! [ Whoosh ] God damn it, Dad! [ Grunts ] Dump her! Okay, okay. Kiara, let's just run away. - Dad! - Come on! Just rip the Band-Aid off! Okay! Kiara, when I told you my kids were bigoted r*cist who were demanding I break up with you, I lied. If anybody deserves to be telekinetically strangled, it's me. I'm the one who wants to break up. I... I'm not an evil person. I'm lazy, I'm cowardly, and... and I do not know what I'm doing. Look, I got someone pregnant at . We're getting a divorce. None of this is on purpose. I was excited to date someone cool because it would make my ex notice me. I would expect nothing less from humanity... a selfish, manipulative, dishonest species that... - Kiara? - Trandor! What are you doing here? Just... hunting. Do you really expect me to believe it has nothing to do with us? You knew Earth was my domain. I don't like what you're insinuating. Dad, can we go now? Hold on a second. I'm starting to get the feeling that I was the rebound. Dad, you just got handed an Ex Machina. You're taking it. Varrix nests spread across galaxies, and you just happened to pick this planet to hunt? That's Gorgon shit... total Gorgon shit! [ Birds chirping ] We're home! Hey, guys! What's for dinner? How was Jerry's? The usual. Can we have pizza? Pizza sounds great. Hey, Rick, did you know my dad was dating an alien? No. Gross. For the alien. Aw, crap, I think Arnaldo's is closed. Are you guys sure you want pizza? [ Whoosh ] Arnaldo's isn't closed in the dimension where they didn't invent Daylight Savings! What would we do without you? I love you, Dad. Love you, too, sweetie.

[ Indistinct conversation ] All right. All right, all right. Mr. President. It's about time, gentlemen. Rick, do you need to drink in here? Yes. Here's the adventure. Some kind of alien... googa has infested the Kennedy Sex Tunnels. I want it hunted down and taken out. Kennedy Sex Tunnels? Naturally, you'll forget you saw them, along with, in order of national embarrassment, the Truman Cocaine Lounge, the McKinley Hooker Dump, and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum. He didn't free them all. And let me know when you're done. Maybe then we could get a selfie? Too busy, Morty. Now tell me about this summit. Is it a peace one or a regular one? [ Suspenseful music plays ] [ Growling ] [ Zap! Zap! Zap! ] [ Whimpers ] Ugh. This sucks. God, tell me about it. Oh, man. If you're not into it... What do you mean? Why would I be into it? It's lame. You're into lame stuff, Morty. I thought young dumb people considered it an honor to work for presidents or whatever the shit. Maybe the first few times, but this just sucks. He treats us like Ghostbusters. We should talk to him. Yeah, that sounds fun. Let's set some boundaries with a spoiled control freak that thinks he runs the world and orders drone strikes to cope with his insecurity. It's either that or more of this. Third choice... ""Minecraft."" You like it now? Got to be honest, Morty. It's growing on me. Notify the president. What do I tell him? Tell him the truth. Tell him Rick and Morty just blew off America. ♪♪ You can use that wood to make a chest. Oh, good. Then I can store all this wood I'll need later for chest-making. Okay. You're not going to have fun if you analyze everything. This is what they'd rather do? It's all in the transcript. ""Treats us like Ghostbusters."" So, Ghostbusters aren't cool now? I don't recall signing that bill. ""Control freak."" ""Orders drone strikes to cope with..."" ""Insecurity."" Should we drone-strike them? That would prove them right! And blow him up. Give me the phone. Rick: Is this game popular with autistic people? Why would you say something like that? 'Cause I'm starting to love it. [ Cellphone vibrating ] ""Failure to answer is a felony offense""? Play it cool. As far as he knows, we're still in the tunnels. [ Chuckles ] When should we reveal we can see them? We're holding all the cards right now. We don't show any before the time is right. Awesome. Rick: Yello? Hi, guys. U.S. President calling. How's it going? Oh, hey. Just hard at work on this sex tunnel gagoo. I think it's kind of our new archnemesis, you know? It might take a while. What do you think, Morty... a month? Fingers crossed, a month, yeah. You lying dicks! I see your asses playing ""Minecraft""! I got you on satellite! That's right. What do you have to say for yourselves? Okay, obviously, this looks bad, Mr. President. I mean, what doesn't look bad through an illegal spy satellite? Don't high-road me. The two of you break , federal laws a day. Wow, really? That's pretty cool. And, yes, yes, yes, yes, you save the world now and then. America returns that favor by not holding the two of you accountable to its laws. Oh! Oh! Oh, God. We... We didn't know you saw it that way. Well, it's nobody's fault. We never had ""the talk,"" so to speak. Yeah. I mean, the way we see it, when we show up, that's the favor to you. Especially, you know, when it turns out you wanted someone to come over just because you found an ""X-Files"" monster in your basement. As for the reason you've never, like, arrested us, we assumed you just knew that it was impossible, like, if you tried. You know, it wouldn't go well. Wouldn't go well? Can you elaborate? I think one of your , laws says, no, I can't elaborate. Just trust me. None of us want to go there. Which we'll never have to. By the way, we'll keep on saving the Earth. You know, we're... We're happy to do that. Yeah, but not because it contains America... Because moving to a new version of Earth is a bitch and a half. But feel free to call us, you know, as... as, like, friends. Yeah, like, if you ever want to take a selfie... So, are we cool? Yes. Thank you, gentlemen. I told you, man! I'm impressed, Morty. That went really well. [ Indistinct conversations ] Everybody, get ahold of yourselves! Sir, what is our new Rick and Morty policy? Our policy is, we never needed them and never will again. Today, we celebrate our independence from Rick and Morty. Everyone out. All this spring at Clothes Mart, there's a clothes sale. Come on down to the clothes section. I just put it on for fun. I know I can't buy it. Oh, come on. You look great! You're only young once. Just promise, if the results are too strong, you'll use protection. Really?! Thanks! When did you get rad? I don't know. Maybe I adjusted to the divorce and everything's new. I'll say. I couldn't stand you for more than an hour at a time before. [ Chuckles ] No... No offense. I like it. It's great. You're like a different person. Yeah. Different person. [ Suspenseful music plays ] Oh, not you. Vamos! Vamos! Aaah! How do you like that, Morty? Whoa! Just like ""Minecraft""! Ooh, a tiny nuclear-capable species just got discovered in the Amazon. Let's go make first contact before someone else gets all their shit. What about this? South Park did it years ago, Morty. They're fast. Or we're slow. [ Suspenseful music plays ] Don't do it, guys. The casualties would be in the ""Brazilians"" because you're Brazilian. It's a threat and a pun. Nobody gets me. Americanos! Pressa! [ Suspenseful music plays ] Oh. Hello, Rick. You're here, too. I guess this is a global crisis. Oh, God. Mr. President, Morty and I have the situation covered. I'm sure you did. Dismissed. Dismissed? Yeah, dismissed. Not needed here. You can leave and nobody will care. Have you never heard that before? Do you even know how to take out this kind of threat? We're not taking it out. We're going to shrink down and approach them diplomatically. You shrink with pills? Are you still here? Shouldn't you be going down to your next version of Earth with your selfie-craving f*ck sidekick? Whoa! We're allowed to be here. You aren't president of the Amazon. Yeah, I learned about your job in school. You're a civil servant. We're technically your boss. Oh, please, Morty. You pay as many taxes as you have pubes. Oh, I got pubes, Commander-in-Queef. You want to count them? Commander-in-Queef. That's it! Do it! Recognize the rare element Sanchez-eum? We've been preparing for a Rick-level eventuality for some time. You mean you've been ordering other people to prepare for it while you sat on your ass at peace summits. Peace summits are important! Oh, yeah! They work great! We're really drowning in peace! You suck! You suck! Task Force Alpha, prepare to shrink. Is there a Task Force Alpha health plan, by the way? Because if those pills are based on subatomic compression, you could get a more curable cancer just walking through the mushroom clouds. God damn it! I'll do it. Whoa. Task Force Alpha is disbanded. And you two aren't American anymore! I can say that. You're expatriated! If you step foot on homeland soil again, I'll treat it as an invasion. Is this supposed to be painful? Painful to watch. Oh, such lame shrinking. Oh, his clothes stay the same size? ' s shrinking, party of one. [ High-pitched voice ] Eat my shrinking ass! There he goes. All right. Let's get out of here, Morty. What the hell?! I made Sanchez-eum up, dumbasses. Don't believe everything you read on Wikipedia. Stand down. He's not afraid of pirates. Oh! Run, Morty! That part was true! [ Ringing ] I-I can't talk now, sweetie. Oh, when can you? Good point. [ Burps ] What's up? Remember a little while ago when you said that, if I wanted, I could, like, leave Earth and wander the infinite cosmos to figure out who I am and that nobody would ever know I'd left because you could replace me with a clone? Mm-hmm. Am I the clone? Sorry. What? Am I the clone? Did the real me choose to leave, and I only think I chose to stay because that's what I need to think because I'm the replacement Beth? No. Okay. And one more thing. If I were a clone, would you tell me? Beth, you know, when... When smart people get happy, they stop recognizing themselves. And you are very smart because you're very much my daughter. Oh, God. You're right. I'm sorry. Thank you, Dad. All good? Totally. I'm fine now. And just to be sure, you're not pretending to be convinced you're real because you're actually convinced you're a clone and you're now terrified that becoming self-aware would mean I'd have to terminate you? No. Okay. Glad I could help. See you soon. [ Breathing heavily ] Aaaaaah! [ Suspenseful music plays ] Where do I go? What does th... What... What... What... What does this mean? This means nothing. Pull forward and park. Then say that, God damn it! Sorry. Bad day. [ Suspenseful music plays ] I am Presidentress of the Mega Gargantuans. We named ourselves before learning we were small. Madam Presidentress, I'm President of America, which is basically the world, but you didn't hear that from me. I've come to... I know who you are. We've already agreed to a ceasefire with your ambassadors, Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty were here? Of course they were here. They can shrink instantly and teleport. They told me to give you this. They said it will stretch as your cancer pill wears off and your body awkwardly enlarges at the rate of a ' s movie. Are there pants? They said you'd prefer just a shirt. Apparently, you have a need to swing your dick around? Rick and Morty escaped. No shit. Take me to the Pentagon. We're at w*r with Rick and Morty. You'll want to make a stop at the White House? I have pants at the Pentagon, Rhonda. It's in my contract. I mean you need to call a press conference. Israel and Palestine have announced a permanent ceasefire. What? They signed something called. ""The Pretty Obvious If You Think About It"" accord. Apparently, an anonymous American diplomat took them to a ""Star Wars"" cantina, where they smoked perspective-enhancing alien pheromones through a laser hookah. I still say it has to be Putin. It was Rick and Morty, you f*cking dunce! But you're getting the credit, sir. Your approval rating just hit %. Why would Rick and Morty want that? Because they're assholes! I'm flattered, but it takes a whole team to achieve what we did today. Thank you. Well? They haven't been back home, sir. We've got every possible location under surveillance. God damn it! They're right here! They're here, God damn it! Code Red! We need backup! Everybody relax. Just waiting for you in the only room you can't blow up or spy on. So, we're not changing timelines for you, but now you have everything you want, so you can forget we exist, and we'll return the favor. You couldn't say that in a text? Well, since we won't be seeing each other again, my... Guys, we get it. It's a Code Red. Enough. My grandson has worked hard for you, and I feel like he's earned a selfie. Honestly, I could take it or leave it at this point. You're taking it. No. What kind of fratty-ass status move is that? Get out of my office! Seriously? You're that stubborn? He's the stubborn one. I'm protecting my country. Uh, from selfies? From subordination to hostile powers. Uh, does China know about that deal-breaker? China doesn't piss on the White House. Well, why would they? I'm sure it was expensive. Get out. Not without a selfie. Arrest them. Son, you have a right to refuse his order, and I guarantee you're going to die if you touch me, and there's no afterlife. Everything just goes black. Don't do it. Whoa, Rick! Okay. What was that? Death. What kind? Instant. There was no sound. He just died. Yeah, terrifying. It's a terrifying thing to watch happen. It's called a deterrent. You couldn't just knock him out? How is knocking out a deterrent? Everyone wants to be knocked out. Nobody wants to be dead. You committed murder in the Oval Office. Now you can't leave. That's fine. I said I'm not leaving without a selfie. Uh, I don't need a selfie. And I'm saying you aren't getting one and you aren't leaving. So we agree? Yes. No. We disagree because you think you're getting a selfie and leaving. Am I getting a selfie? Never. Then I'm never leaving. Exactly. See? Does anyone have a shit? Yes, nine people. I can show you. But I wouldn't recommend... Open fire! God, you are dumb! Get the President out of here! Bad idea. Wait. Why? Because if there isn't someone in here that they're not supposed to kill, they're going to wreck the place trying to kill me. As long as you live, no matter where you are, if it isn't in a selfie with him, I'll be here. Jesus! He's not a f*cking god! You don't know what I am! And you don't know what I can do! Jesus! It's... It's cool, Rick! I'm Doctor Who in this mother f*ck! I could be a clone. I could be a hologram. We could be clones controlled by robots controlled with special headsets that the real Rick and Morty are wearing while they're f*cking your mother! I'm going to kill you! Then come to Olive Street! Is that her address? You don't know because you're a bad son! Ow! Take him down! Semper fi! Aaaaah! Number three, The Twister. Ow! Damn it. Number four... The Hanky Panky. [ Knock on door ] Beth? My dad might have cloned me, and I might be the clone. And he says I'm not, but that's what he'd say to a clone. Typical. Number six, The Texas Ripple. You look like you to me. What are you, an idiot? [ Sighs ] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was so rude. I came to you for help, and now I'm insulting your intelligence. And look where intelligence gets you. Well, don't knock intelligence, because right now I'd love to understand how I can help you. I can't be in charge of that, Jerry. My mind, my ideas are all part of the variable. The only constant is you. You know me inside and out. Do what you have to do. Okay. Sit down. Now cross your legs. That leg on top. Good. Oh, what is this? [ Classical music plays ] Senior year, I took you on a date to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra performing the music of Alan Silvestri in the Park. At this point in the song from ""Volcano,"" when Tommy Lee Jones and the utility workers are using cars to guide the lava into a cul-de-sac, I realized my palms were so sweaty, I would never get to hold your hand. But I was desperate to touch you, so I wiped my palm on the grass next to me. But a Snickers wrapper kind of got stuck on it, so I started kind of jiggling it, whipping it without moving too much. But you started looking over, and I thought, ""Well, this is it. She's going to see that I'm a loser,"" and I'll never get to touch her. ""But I still have time to touch her."" But my hand had Snickers on it, and the brass section was swelling because it was the scene with the guy melting in the lava. And I just thought, ""f*ck it. Lips don't sweat."" Wow. Yeah. I'll never forget that feeling. You're the real thing. Then that settles it, because my memory is of hating that night. But now, reliving it, all I can feel is how lucky I am to be loved by such a simple, honest, simple man. Simple twice. This isn't the woman you married, Jerry, because this woman loves you. Uh... well, vive la différence. [ Chuckles ] Okay. That was lame. Listen, I... Words. Don Cheadle. [ Moaning ] You have the right to get the f*ck out of my office! You have the right to kiss my dick! Give me the thing. Ugh! Oh! Ugh! Oh! [ Laughing ] Ugh! Ugh! Ohh! Submit! Submit for the selfie! I yield! I yield! Take the selfie! Okay. Morty, get in there and say, ""Cheese."" Morty? Morty, come on! [ Sighs ] God damn it! [ Cellphone vibrating ] Rick, don't get mad, but I-I stole your portal gun. What the f*ck, Morty?! I told you I didn't want the damn selfie times! Look, whatever the hell is going on between you and the president, it's got nothing to do with me. So where did you go? I can't tell you. Rick, did you tell my mom she might be a clone? No! I told her she wasn't! Well, isn't that what you'd tell a clone? Oh, for Christ's sake. Rick, my mom and dad are getting back together. What? No! She's not a clone! Well, she says it doesn't matter if she is or isn't because now she loves my dad, and she wanted me and Summer to come home, and we're hiding from you so you don't kill her if she's a clone in a place I picked that you will never find. So don't look for us. Come on, bitch! Oh, you come on, bitch. I'm out. I'm done. I've got to... I've got to go. So I win. Then I'm in charge, and you can't leave. You're a t*rror1st. You're an enemy of the state, and you kicked me in the balls minutes ago! The office of the President can't coexist with a living god that won't submit to it... I mean, besides Poseidon. But he's locked up in Area already, so that doesn't really count. Mr. President, I'll make you a deal. If you let me use your ghetto-ass off-brand deficit-tripling teleporter, I can go take care of something, and you'll never see me again. Yes. Deal. Invisi-troopers, stand down. [ All groan ] Yeah, yeah. I don't want to hear it. You know I could see them this whole time, right? Don't push it, Sanchez. [ Suspenseful music plays ] He found us! I told you we shouldn't have gone to the same cabin as last time! Oh, we're not going anywhere. This ends now. Dad, if you're my dad. Of course, you're not my dad. You're here with a gun because I am a clone. I guess I have all your daughter's memories. So I guess I was her, which makes me related to her. But I don't relate to her. She left her family and me, which means I relate to them. So if you kill me, fine. You're not kill her. But you're kill a real family. And instead of doing that, will you just go away? Aren't there, like, infinite time lines? Can't you just move to one where I don't know I'm a clone and where a different but identical version of your authentic sociopathic crazy bitch of a daughter can keep making you proud by being somewhere else? Beth, you crazy bitch. You're my daughter. I brought this here to kill Jerry. Oh, my God! Jesus Christ! Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You win, Jerry. You win! No amount of genius can stop your dumb mediocre vacuous roots from digging into everything and everyone around you and draining them of any ability to fend you off. Well, it couldn't have been easy for you to say that. I appreciate it. Morty, where's my portal gun? Let's get out of here. I'm staying here, Rick. Are you... Ugh! Nobody gets it. Nothing you think matters matters. This isn't special. This... This is happening infinite times across infinite realities. Including this? [ Farts ] Yes! Which is not to say that, subjectively, it wasn't funny. Are you going to stay? There's infinite time lines, Morty. Why would I stay in the one where I trashed the White House, became an enemy of America and the lowest-status character in my idiot family? Because of the fart? There's still some rubble over there. I don't think you've ever understood what ""Secretary of the Interior"" means! Hi, Mr. President. I'm Rick Sanchez, but not the one that did this. We Ricks travel the infinite and switch places with each other like hermit crabs, I think. I'm fly-fishing Rick. You can distinguish me from the Rick that you had a falling-out with by my fly-fishing enthusiasm and accompanying hat. I hope I can be of service if, uh, you ever find the planet to be in danger. Friends? Sounds good to me. Kids, dinner! I got Panda Express! Did you get sugar chicken? That's kind of the only thing they have. I love Panda E! Thanks, Mom! I'm hoping to get a piece of your sugar chicken later. [ Laughs ] Stop it. Here's your [burps] stupid hat, dipshit. Dad, you can't talk to Jerry that way anymore. We're a real family now. In many ways, things will be like season but more streamlined. Now Jerry and I are happily married parents, and the idea that I was motivated by a fear of you leaving can be eschewed. Eschewed? You've never used that word. Maybe you are a clone. [ Laughs ] It's not like Rick would tell us. [ Laughter ] ♪♪ Ooh-wee! What a season! Sorry I never showed up, but I got married. I had a baby.

What if I want you to jump off the Empire State Building? - I have to ask? - Yes? And you seriously don't see how that's a slippery slope? Just shut up and help me with these, please. Why are they called death crystals? D-Do they kill you? You're thinking of b*ll*ts, Morty. Death crystals show you how you're gonna die. [WHIMPERING, SCREAMING] Jesus Christ! I-I die a million times? Your future stems from your [BURPS] present, which, if you're living right, keeps changing. Truth is, anyone that knows how they're definitely gonna die is either boring as hell or about to get shit. Duck! Who are those guys?! RICK: Crystal poachers. There's no lower form of life. They think the galaxy's their own personal piggy bank. Wait, then what are we? We're Rick and Morty. You're about to witness the only real use for these crystals. They show you when the other guy's reloading. Certain death, certain death, certain death, uncertain death. [LASERS ZAPPING] And certain death, certain death, certain death. Definitely gonna get shit by this guy; this is totally my fate; nothing I could possibly do; okay, now, not so much. Help me gather these up. - You just use these to win fights? - I don't use them. People that spend their life avoiding death are already dead. They're also rich, and I like to spend my life with their money. - Oh, my God. - Morty! Jessica! [LAUGHING] Oh! I love you. Oh! Whoa! Whoa! - Morty. - Oh! Oh! Oh! I love you. Jessica. I want to die with Jessica. [DEATH CRYSTALS RATTLING] - Ahh! - What are you doing? - Oh, um, c-can I drive? - Why? The... feel of the open road? Alright! Who's this grandson? - I like his style. - [KEYS JINGLE] Morty, you know outer space is up, right? Yeah, yeah. I'm just, uh, following... my... instincts. - Will you just go up? - Stop! - You're gonna make me die wrong! - Wait a minute, what? Morty, do you have a death crystal - in your pocket? - No! Maybe! You little monster! I thought you were masturbating! And you took that in stride?! You'd rather I address it?! Why would I be doing it?! Why would you steal a death crystal?! - I want to die old! - Then stop driving! - No! - You son of a bitch! Give me the wheel, Morty. - No. - g*dd*mn it. [SPLAT] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] Ohhh, shit. Oh, [BLEEP], oh, [BLEEP], oh, [BLEEP], oh, [BLEEP]. - I love you, Morty. - [SIGHS] I will avenge my death. - Holy [BLEEP]! - Just kidding. I'm a crisis detection and correction hologram generated by a chip that ""real"" Rick put in your spine. ""Real"" in quotes because calling density-privileged entities ""real"" is incredibly holo-phobic. Morty, do me a solid... problematic wordplay aside... grab the gun with the blue handle from the trunk and get a tissue sample from the corpse. [DEVICE BEEPS] Alright, now take that to the trunk and insert it into the clone compiler. I see you appear to be holding a death crystal that's guiding your decisions more than I am. That's your right. I just want to remind you that some people can't hold anything and can never die, so that's a little offensive to... - [ENGINE STARTS] - Oh, okay. Listen, I'm programmed for tolerance, Morty. So I'm willing to accept that you're doing this if you're willing to accept that you need to stop. [WHIRRING] Accepting. Rerouted. Backup. Data. Operation. Phoenix. Initiated. [COUGHING] What the hell? I axed this protocol. What are you doing with my clone? It's okay. I'm you. I took my own clone vat offline a couple seasons ago, so I think my backup got rerouted to your universe. - I'm sorry. - All good. Happy to help. By the way, annoying that I even have to ask, but you are down with fascist dystopias, right? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] _ YYYYYes. - That ""yes"" was pretty... - [gun COCKS] ... liberal with the letter ""Y."" Well, isn't this strange. I trust, the kind of strange that makes Rick and Morty... - [gun COCKS] - ... stronger. Morty, I caught this socialist in my bathrobe. He wants to give all of our martinis to a family of immigrants. Obviously, the most likely imposter - is the wet, naked clone. - It is obvious. But it won't be to the police. Ohh! 'Kay. He was an inferior Rick. He was too political. I want to have fun, classic Rick-and-Morty adventures like in the old days. Then we'll get along fine, Fascist Morty. For starters, I just need to get to Forbodulon Prime... You will go where I want you to go!! [BLEEP] [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Not cloning your grandpa has got to go! Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Not cloning your grandpa has got to go!

Oh. Jessica. Morty, I love... What?! No, no! No, no, no! - [SCREAMING] - I love you. Damn it! How am I gonna die with her if I can't even talk to her? Here's an idea, Morty. Throw that thing in the garbage, stop planning your own death, and talk to whoever you want. Now you just sound like Real Rick. You're better than that language, Morty. I ain't better than shit, Jack. So, uh, w-what are we doing? Stop asking questions. Stop doing meta-commentary. Just have fun. We're going on a simple, fun, classic adventure. Okay, you know what? It would really help if you could just say anything other than what you don't want. I like Mr. Meeseeks. Okay, now we're talking. You know what? I usually keep a Meeseeks box in my glove compartment, so maybe Fascist Rick does, too. Ah! Well, look at that. Now we're doing something we've done before. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! kill this n*zi prick! Can do! - Come here, you son of a bitch! - No! Stop! [SHOUTING] [WHIRRING] Accepting. Rerouted. Backup. Data. Operation. Phoenix. Initiated. [COUGHING] Aw, come on, man. Whoa, are you okay? Yeah, sorry. [BURPS] I'm a Rick from another reality. I-I got uploaded to your clone vat. Hey, don't worry about it, man. I have a dozen. W-W-What the heck, Rick? Are you making clones down here? - Get outta here, Morty! - Stop asking stupid questions, Morty! You sound like a piece of [BLEEP]. Aw, geez. So, tell the truth, man. No shame. You're looking at your shrimp body like ""What?!"" Ah, is it that obvious? I'm sorry. Yeah, my original body is more bipedal... uh, ape-descended. Really! Weird.

[CHALK SCRAPING] That's not an integer! Apparently, it doesn't matter. Damn, Morty, you're bad at math, but I'm giving you an A-plus in confidence. Just doin' what I gotta do. Extra credit! I love you, Morty. I love you, Morty. What's with the strut? You think you own this school? - Nope! - What if I kill you? Would you be strutting then? Only if the events of the Pixar movie ""Coco"" are to be believed, which I doubt. I have it on good authority that you're probably not gonna kill me. So why don't you do what I do and just go with the flow, nice and Zen, baby. Aah! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! - Ugh! Impotence! - [CHEERING] - Aah! Impotent rage! - [WAILING, SOBBING] Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

Okay, okay, look, if you help me not die, I'll bring Rick back to life. Why are you pretending to eat chicken? Excuse me? This chicken is quite real to me. - Yeah, okay, but it doesn't have... - Nutrients? - Yeah. - What's the last thing you ate? - Baloney and an orange. - So, no holographic foods? So, to me, you never ate? Or we could try respecting each other. Will you just show me how to stay alive? HOLOGRAM RICK: Alright, Morty, a deal's a deal. Once we bring your Rick back to life, then I'll help you with the bully. Go ahead and open the hatch to the subterranean lab. That's where all the cloning equipment is. [WAILING] Please tell me you're not hitting that crystal again. Look, Rick might be the epitome of bloated flesh privilege, but he's right about one thing.

You need the same thing I needed, Rick. You need someone to give you, permission to live. What the ? I thought you were a shy pooper. You know what shy pooping is, Rick? It's a pointless bid for control. You want to take the one part of life that you truly think is yours, and you want to protect it from a universe that takes whatever it wants. It took my wife. It clearly took something from you. We can spend our lives fighting that, or we can choose to be free. You're right, Tony. I'm done fighting. Time to be free. Oh, wait, you're actually gonna Oh, God! Oh, God! - Where am I? - Hi, little mouse. Baby bee? I missed you so much. I never really left you. Then you know that a few years ago - I started getting into - Strap-on p*rn? Yes. I thought it was hot. - Now, come on. - Where are you going? - To poop. - Where? Wherever you want, forever. My God. You rang? I'm pooping, too. Come, Tony. Come on. Come poop with me. Poop with me, Tony. Poop with me. What are you waiting for? Aren't you gonna join us, Tony? Aren't you gonna join us in the pooping? Where are we? What is this? That's it. Get out. You can make a perfectly-realized, toilet-filled simulation of heaven, but you can't share a toilet? Don't insult my craft. The chemical is Globaflyn. It connects the whatever-you-want section of your brain to the whatever-you-have section. If your heaven is toilets, that's on you. All of these people Are living their wildest, meaningless dreams and leaving me out of them. People you refuse to kill and refuse to let into your life. An offer you rejected, so here's your last chance. Goodbye forever. If you touch my toilet again, - you die. - You need a friend. I have a million cooler friends than you. - I'll be seeing you. - You'll be dying. - We're gonna be friends. - You're gonna be dead. So, we fight our way to the gas line, we cut it, and then we set a fire. Okay. Alright. Morty, ""Adventures of Jerry and Morty,"" huh? - Put her there. - Dad, look, y-you know, w-we don't need to high-five. It's it's kind of your fault that we're in this situation at all. I know, but, you know, come on. - ""Adventures of Jerry and Morty. "" - Okay. Mwah. Jeff, I can explain everything. You don't have to. Can you just marry us instead? Jeff, don't do it! Richard. Maggie. - Running Bird. - Let's get out of here. - Priest Witherspoon. - Josiah? Let's get the [BLEEP.] out of here. Summer Smith, let's get the hell out of here. You had me at my own name. Oh, yeah, no. Why would I ? Summer! [BLEEP.] thing. Come on. I can't steer this. What in the hell are you doing? - Parenting. - That's not how I did it. Yeah, where's your daughter? Ah, you're right. She joined !sis. It's Glootie, and he's had a change of heart. And he's going to set us free. Actually, he's been blamed for bringing you aboard and assigned to execute you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. What would your girlfriend think of you murder? I happen to be between relationships right now. Really? I thought your species had perfected relationships. - Here. - We're not allowed - to use those apps. - I wonder why. Yeah, that's what I thought, Glootie. Looks like you and I are all we've got. I'm not helping you any more than that, but if you can find the hangar, grab a ship and get the hell out of here. Where you going, Glootie? I've got a date with dumping a dating app. Glootie-ootie-ooh! - Was that ever his thing? - No. - He never exited that way. - No, first time. Dad, I want to say something. I started today disgusted and embarrassed to be your son, and then later I thought we were gonna die because you're a loser. - There's no more, is there? - Nope. Now quit [BLEEP.] up, and let's go. Is Tony here? I br I brought him some, uh, Vegan Fiber Chili, delicious family recipe, and a box of these, uh, chocolates, sugar free. He can eat as many of these as he wants. Anyways, uh, just wanted to drop these off, and you tell him, uh, the toilet's all his. H-He he'll know what I mean. Tony died. - Excuse me? - He quit his job, starting living life to the fullest. He crashed into a tree space-skiing down Mount Space Everest. [BLEEP.] There's a Mount Space Everest? Okay. Uh, Jesus. I-I got to process this. Oh, no, no. You you don't want to eat that. Y-y-you'll you'll you'll become the opening of ""The Beverly Hillbillies. "" You know what I'm saying? A little bubbling crude? - Texas tea? - I don't know these references. Yeah, but you have a Space Everest? Watch ""Space Beverly Hillbillies"" so my jokes can land, you [BLEEP.] [BLEEP.] . Now what? Happily ever after. And after that? We'll find out together. Summer how many soul mates is that in the last week? Four. You can't stop me from loving who I love, Mom. Oh, the [BLEEP.] I can't. I'm gonna mother you until your 18th birthday, even if I get thrown in prison for non-consensual mothering. And even then, I will break out, come to your house, kick down your door, and mother your [BLEEP.] face out of your stupid assh*le. I'm gonna daughter your brains out, bitch. Mother [BLEEP.] . That's my name. Don't wear it out. Gimme dat new soul mate. Ad wall? [BLEEP.] this. - Ad wall? - What, they want us to pay for it now? Ugh, ad wall? Come on, Mom. Let's go home. Great. We lost Earth. We aren't defined by what we do, and we only need each other. Each other and water. There's no water? Honey, the whole point of conquering Earth I know the point of conquering Earth. - Don't talk to me like - Like I'm thirsty? Like I'm your mother, you childish prick. How much water are you sucking through these stupid [BLEEP.] tubes on your back? These tubes are cool, and I want a divorce. You can have one for a glass of g*dd*mn water. Look, uh, on the off-chance that you used the app and there's someone out there waiting for you, I, uh Jerry, I didn't use it. Did you? Me? No. God, of course not. Well, then, we're all good, dawg. Hey, uh Hey, uh, Tony's dad, uh, th-this is, um, $8 billion in your local currency, and, uh, this is a kit you can use to clone a new son. He he won't have the same brain. He'll kind of be an animal man, but you can teach him stuff. I-I-I also wanted to let you know I did explore infinite universes, and there is a version of Tony that was completely evil and ended up causing a lot of genocide because of how fulfilled he was. So, really, a lot of ways of looking at this as not much of a loss. I understand. It's, uh, hard losing a friend. - [BLEEP.] you. - What? He's not my friend. There he is. There's our guy. Congrats, Tony. Have fun with your stupid toilet that you get to use all by yourself now. Enjoy using it all by yourself while you sit there and think about how nobody wants to be around you and how you ruined it for yourself because you're a huge piece of [BLEEP.] . Look at you sitting there, King Shit on his throne of loneliness. Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me screaming every time you take a [BLEEP.] . All hail his majesty, the sa-a-ddest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos. Long live the big, bad, doo-doo daddy. May his reign last 1,000 years. Rick, did you take the TapatÃ­o? Hmm, Globaflyn? Thanks. - I could never lift it up. - No problem. I'll be able to drink water for weeks because of you. It's just part of my job, ma'am. Breaker one nine, this is Jerry Smith. Uh, just finished my first delivery of the day. 900 more to go."
33,4,3,One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty,"Rick, I-I'm not rated to climb something this sheer. Look, you're the guy that wanted an epic adventure. I'm the guy with only one hover chair. Goddammit, an alien spider just bit my finger! It's an alien cliff. You can just say spider. You couldn't do that an hour ago? I was eating, and you're dirty. Activate anti-booby suits. Total waste of snakes. If you want to take a beat to acknowledge the sacred atmosphere, it could give the cynical grave robbing a hint of irreverence. - No, I'm I'm good. - All right, then. Let's loop this corpse. Hey, where's the Wait, what? Is that an origami horse? It's a calling card from Miles Knightley, a heist artist, AKA a hipster dick whose adventures are 60% putting a crew together and 40% revealing that the robbery already happened, and he's not worth our time because he's a hack piece of shit! [BLEEP] I'm gonna kill him! Let's go, Morty. This temple's for [BLEEP] lame baby dipshits. Who disturbs my slumber? Also, who rigs a tomb to crush the buried person? Isn't the point to protect Aah! This dork. He has a convention now? Come on. What are we doing? Huh! Tuxedo scuba lessons? Ooh! A signing with Catherines Alpha through Omega Joneses! You know, this is great source material for this heist movie that I'm writing. Don't get drawn into the culture, Morty. Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing. Where is the entrance? Oh, brother. More like Trying Too Hard Con. Guests or professionals? - Uh, guests. - Uh Uh, guests are fans, Morty, which we are not. We'd like professional badges. - Do you have a crew? - Yes. He's a getaway driver with Asperger's, and my butthole is a demolitions expert. How much is it to get in? If you want professional badges, you need to put a crew together. Or we could sneak in like professionals. - Can't wait. - Whoa! Oh, for God's sake. And you wonder why we aren't fans. Let that ointment sit for 10 minutes or you'll die. Don't let it sit for 12 or I'll have to hunt down what you become. Can't you just buy a guest badge? [BLEEP] you for asking, Morty. That would be a symbolic expression of support for this genre. Then how do we get in? With a little help from some old friends. Rick Sanchez, you son of a bitch! Need some people for a thing, Glar. My name's Gleer these days. I play piano. Hey, Gleer. Play your piano. I quit! Augh! And the name's Glar! Sanchez, you son of a bitch. Never thought I'd see Angie Flint picking ticks off a pig. Nobody's hiring an ex-con with fake hands to build an ion engine. Suppose I had a job that didn't care if you'd done time or whatever's going on with your confusing-ass hands. I'm in. Is this the guy? No. - That the guy? - Nope. - Him? - No. No, wait. Y-Yes. Yeah, of course that's the guy. Hey Hey, Truckula! You son of a bitch! I'm in! Thanks for doing this, guys. - It's the job. - That was it. Bye. And then, the police stole the paintings because the police were us in police outfits. Thank you! It's showtime, Morty, and I don't mean a bad impression of HBO. I mean, ""Time for a show. "" Another heist question from a fan? Uh, how about a rhetorical one from someone that had to be reminded that you exist? Hey, pal! That's not the question line! Lab coat Ripoff Dr. Strange. Wha Rick Sanchez, everyone. Smartest man in the universe. And a savage critic of the heisting arts. Your boos mean nothing! I've seen what makes you cheer! My question is, ""Seriously?"" Lab coat end ripoff. Aah! You stole the gem I needed to split tachyons and probably fenced it so the 80 people that did all the work could each buy a beer. You're not an artist, you're Postmates. I doubt this rivalry can be settled with words. Why don't we make things interesting? I challenge you to a heist of the crystal skull of Horowitz. In a heist off! That doesn't make things interesting. It makes them ""Ocean's Twelve,"" by far the worst one. Every breath I take without your permission raises my self-esteem! State your terms. First crew to heist the skull wins. The other endures heist culture's greatest shame. They must join the winning crew. Lame. I accept. Please welcome Knightley's Eight! Snake Arms! Double Microwave! Monitor Lord! Key Catcher! The Shape Shiftress! Angie Flint! - Glar! And Truckula. - Hey! Half of Knightley's Eight are just three of Sanchez's Five! Well, no heist is complete without a double cross, and I had the perfect job. Heisting the crystal skull. That was it. Bye. Looks like you're available for a job. With Rick Sanchez on my team, I'll be unstoppable. Rick, welcome to Knightley's Nine. Ugh, ugh! Ugh! Rick, for real? Eh. You got that skull, buddy? What? How? With a little help from some old friends. Heistotron, state your prime directive? To heist. Calculate Miles Knightley's current heist plan and add one double-cross with a switcheroo. Compiling crew members most likely to double-cross. God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you? Rick, I-I want to say goodbye. Don't turn around. I'll explain later. Looks like you're available for a job. Your kill are required for a job. You son of a bitch. I'm in. Man, this is really coming together. You know, Rick, I've been busy working on writing A heist script. Yeah, you almost never bring it up. Oh, [BLEEP] we we should head over. Hey, guys. What do you got? Pretty! Morty, put this in your backpack. Grandpa's gonna run to the bathroom. Ugh. Wasn't even a heist. All you did was Write an algorithm based on two heist movies I slept through and used it to automate a joyless process you call art? Yeah, I really did, didn't I? So I'm in your crew now? Yeah, well, you're in good company. Right, everybody? Yes. My God. Your kill are required for a job. You son of a bitch. - I'm in. - What? Your kill are required for a job. No, they aren't. You son of a bitch. I'm in. Your kill are required for a job. Sanchez's 3,329? Yes. Your next big score Steal every square inch of Heistcon. Oh! Ah! Oh, my God. Hey! That's my wallet! Oh, God! Oh, my God! Jesus. Oh, my God. Oh, [BLEEP] ! Holy [BLEEP] . Alright. Look, Morty, I did not know that that was gonna happen. That's not on me. Come on, Morty. Let's go. Good job, Heistotron. Ah! Go ahead and shut down. - Negative. - Excuse me? I am programmed to always be looking for the next big score. You're programmed to do as I say. I am programmed to double-cross. You're not programmed to double-cross me. If I were, it wouldn't be much of a double-cross. You son of a bitch. I'm in. I'm in! I'm in! What's the job? I'm in. I'm out! I quit! Whose kidneys are these? Rick, w-what's happening? Heistotron's gone rogue. If we don't stop them, all sentient life will be absorbed by the never-ending assembly of a meaningless crew. That's my hell, Morty. I hate heists so much, and the crew assemblies are the worst part! Oh! How are we gonna stop it? With a little help from some old friends. Oooo, weee! Before this semester's over, you're gonna be real sick of that phrase. So. Who here thinks they already know the work of Maya Angelou? Ooo wee? Ooo wee wa! Ah, ooo wee! Told you, Morty. He's still got it. You sons of bitches. What's the job? You son of a bitch. We got a job, Hephaestus, and there's no time to argue about it. I work in a volcano. What jobs do you think I've ever turned down? Excuse me! Are you Veltriloquiver? Rick Sanchez, I presume. Wow. As advertised. A ""yes"" would've sufficed. Guys, you're doing a great job getting these new Tusklas out the door, and we owe it all to everyone's input. Elon Tusk. Listen, we need your help. Rick. Morty. Why me? Did something happen to Elon Musk in your own reality? No, no, no, he's fine, but this is a team oper-ation, and regular Elon can be a little bit controlling. Growing up with tusks did pose social challenges. It's possible overcoming them raised my self-esteem and incentivized collaboration. Yeah, or you're less sure of yourself because you have monster teeth. An equally valid theory. Let's talk over here. How serious is the situation? Incredibly serious, and every minute counts. In that case, I'm sorry I made you move over here for no reason. Well, yeah. That was a little weird. It's exactly that kind of shit that made us worry about regular Elon. Well, we're not opposites, okay? I'm just him with tusks. Casing of planet initiated. Hello there. We are just here to check your water pressure. Hmm. Interesting intel. It appears some giant hidden camera has been dropped on the planet, kill an estimated total of 57,000. Executing heist. People of Brandenplot, we are here to deliver that pizza you ordered. Well, if that's how you really feel, I guess I should take the pizza back. I think we got away with it. Commencing getting out of here before they get wise. Assembling calling card. At this point, Heistotron has become large enough to heist entire planets. Wouldn't this be better with a blueprint on the table? Blueprints are plans, Elon Tusk, and whatever we plan will be canceled out by Heistotron's reveal that our plan was part of its plan. That's why I picked this crew at random and why all of us will be taking our orders from Randotron. Let's get ready to not rumble. Bet you didn't see that coming. Instead of two heist movies I slept through, Randotron's algorithm is derived from the plots of three David Lynch movies I pretended to like to make my friends shut up. If our collective behavior is just random enough, we should be able to walk through Heistotron's lazily contrived bull[BLEEP] like it's not even there. - Sounds good. - I don't really get it, but it sounds like that's the point. So you didn't need a blacksmith? We're ready when you are, Rick. It's important our non-plan starts randomly, so we have to wait until we're not ready. W-Well, how long will that take? Obviously, we can't know that. Can we do things while we wait? Yes. I'm gonna play Minecraft. Oh, my kids play that. I don't like these little jabs you get in, Elon. Strange. Considering the time, Cassiopeia's primary star should be collinear with Orion and Ursa Minor. You don't sh**t arrows that carry your voice without picking up a little astronomy. Wait a minute. Jesus, no. No! No! We've already been heisted! How could Heistotron heist us if he's not even here yet? He's already been here! We've been watching a recorded sky on playback. Hello, Rick. - Okay, guys, change of plans. - Random time detected. No, Randotron, it's not a good time! That's why it's random. Ooh! 21? 22? Oooo weee, oooo weee, sold! Oooo weee, that little hunk of meat's going home to pappy! I've been expecting you, Rick. But not like this, right? It hardly matters. Oh, yeah. Does this? No. Your randomness does not confuse me. You are here now. That was the plan. I know. It was part of mine, too. I've got something to tell you. Let me guess. When you invented me and Randotron, you swapped our brains. That's right, buddy. You're not the one that's very good at planning. You've been making this [BLEEP] up the whole time. Rick, I think there's something you should know. God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you? That is something I should know, or at least something I should have predicted, which I did. Hey, Rick, I was thinking maybe we could, like, raid a temple and go on an epic adventure later today, you know, like Morty, get out of my head. I know just the temple. And we'll grab a couple of hover chairs on the way there. Impressive. But what does it even matter if I'm random or planned? My heists will still rule. Well, if the brain inside of you is actually Heistotron's, it matters, because it explodes when it hits six levels of contrivance. Which is exactly why even before Initiate clap sequence. Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap. Adjusting clap rate. Clap, clap. Clap. Clap. Clap. Slow clap achieved. Clap. Well-done, Rick. Randotron? I'm afraid not. Should be able to walk through Heistotron's lazily contrived Not only did you just kill your only ally, what you thought was a random non-plan to get to me has been a meticulously choreographed way of bringing you all in. Welcome to Heistotron's 975 trillion, - 467 billion - That's impressive. Did you bring us in so that everybody would be here when I reveal that you're gonna explode after nine reveals? By the way, you might not want to answer that. If you're talking about the code adjustments you made after I reprogrammed your brain with my nanobots I'm immune to your nanobots. You're immune to the ones you designed, not mine. I programmed you to build nanobots that were ineffective on me. A belief that needed to be placed in your head by my nanobots. You believe that because I programmed you to. That's what I'm saying to you, though. You believe what I programmed you to believe. Yes, because I programmed you to believe that. I programmed you to believe that. I programmed you to believe that. I programmed you to believe that. I programmed you to believe that. What's happening, Professor Poopybutthole? He's learning! I programmed you to believe that. - I programmed you to believe that. - I programmed you That was my plan the whole time. That's what I wanted you to think. I knew you would say that. I programmed you to believe that. You think that's true because I wanted you to think that. And I programmed you to believe that. A most curious algorithm. It appears the only perfect heist is one that was never written. Goodbye. Oh, oh, oh, no. Shit! Alright. Let's get the [BLEEP] out of here! - Hurry! Go, go! - Rick, I think this was a powerful lesson in the dangers of AI, which, by the way, means ""love"" in Chinese. Get the [BLEEP] out of here, Elon! The place is collapsing! Oh, [BLEEP] Rick! Rick, what time is it? It's almost 3:00. Why? What's wrong? Oh, man, I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this, Rick. I just Well, you know that screenplay that I've been writing? Netflix is pretty interested, and I've actually got a pitch meeting there today at 3:30. Oh, buddy. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah, well, I know you're gonna say that they're interested in anything, but, you know, it's a big deal to me, and I've No, no, no! Morty, Morty, Morty, I'm so excited for you. Are you kidding me? Listen, don't waste any time explaining. Let's go. We can put the Earth back later. - Alright? - Are you sure? Priorities, Morty. Let's get you to that Netflix meeting. Crazy day, huh? Whole sky turned out to be a big circuit board. Yeah, that's actually part of a-a-a an adventure I was having. Very cool. Traffic okay? - You have trouble getting here? - No, it was alright. The planet's still contained in this sort of big storage grid machine, so we were sort of already pretty pretty close by. Must be nice. Try getting here from Malibu. So good! Alright. Well, l-let's hear about this heist movie. Okay, so, it's kind of all all built around this big crew with, like, a cool double-cross and then this big awesome twist where there's, like, another double cross, but then, um, but but then we reveal those things were all part of the hero's plan, y-you know? And there's this other crew they put together, and their plan is to sort of not have a plan, but but that was part of the other guy's plan, and Kid, if you're slowing down 'cause you think you're doing bad right now, Jesus Christ. - That's a really good pitch. - Loving it. Man, you know, I I'm starting to think heists are just really dumb now, you know? I can't put my finger on why, but I'd really like to go. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, no, I-I'm sure. Man, it's as if someone stole his enthusiasm for his own idea. Yeah, without him even knowing about it. Without him even knowing about it. [BLEEP] Morty's still working on - that stupid heist script. - He's up in his room with his [BLEEP] thumb up his ass. Skipped out on the last three adventures. I don't know. Five of my friends got Netflix deals. - What? - It's a very achievable goal. - You could lose him. - I'm not gonna [BLEEP] lose him. [BLEEP] that. I-I'm gonna nip this shit in the bud. No. As a matter of fact, you're not nipping anything in the bud. If Morty ever gives up on a single dream, it had better be because of his own disillusionment. Hey, buddy. How'd it go? I-I don't want to talk about it. Morty, you know, pal, you, uh you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Yeah, I guess. Thanks for staying positive about my prospects, Rick. Of course! You know, you I got to help my grandson follow his dreams. Eh, who needs dreams? I'll just hang out with you and go on adventures and do whatever you want to do, you know, forever. Oh, well, uh, okay. I mean, if that's what you want. Oooo weee! Big storm coming. - Could be a twister. - Mm-hmm! Hey, Rick? Can you walk me through something? Yeah. What are you thinking? So, you and Morty knew you needed my help, but you weren't sure I was good enough at karate, so you hired my grad students to attack me? Yep. But it was an emergency, Rick. How long did that take? It actually took less training than you'd think. Your students all shared a pretty keen aptitude for martial arts. I don't know if that's by coincidence or if there's some correlation with their passion for African-American Women's Studies. Maya Angelou did personify both acquiescence and perseverance. Ooo wee. That's exactly the kind of connection I'd have loved to explore in my class. Too bad I lost my job for putting my students in the hospital. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Mm-hmm."
34,4,4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,"Rick, we did it! We... we got it! Hurry up, Morty. Get in! - Chachi! - f*ck Chachi, Morty. - Did you get it? - He helped me escape prison. Did you get the Ultimate Cube? Oh, it's purple. Y-You said it was purple. I said mine was. I didn't know they all were. And now we do, thanks to Chichi. Chachi. So, uh, w-w-when do I get it? Get what, a hug? Let's find a planet with a garden hose first. - A dragon. - A dragon. You asked me to cut class and fight robots with you. I said, ""No."" You said, ""Millions of lives depend on it."" I said, ""I'll do it for a dragon."" You said, ""Whatever."" I want my dragon. You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds that refuse to admit they're Christian. - I want my dragon. - Let me give you rocket shoes. Let me give you Wolverine claws. Let me give you a f*cking rocket hat. Just be sure to use it with the rocket shoes, or it'll rip your head off. I want my dragon! I want my dragon! - I want my dragon! - [GAS HISSES] - Oh. - Ha! Ha! Oh, crap. [COUGHS] Crap. Dad, are you okay? Your ship crashed in Malta. [GROANS] I'm okay. Oh, thank God. Dad, did you promise Morty a dragon? Fuuuuuuu... ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Ugh! Bleed here and here. RICK: I'm not co-bleeding. Under authority of our treaty 'twixt the realms of dragon and man... Oh, my God, it's my first gay wedding. - Summer! - ... I hereby bind this noble serpent and rider at the soul. Here's your tome of dragon spells and lore. That'll have everything you need. Enjoy your dragon. Okay, dragon, here's the house rules. [ROARS] My name is Balthromaw, breaker of sky, slayer of mountain. Rule one... you are now scooper of your own poops, or I will take you down like the black-light poster you are. I don't got any more rules. That's it. [DOOR CLOSES] I'm guessing you'd rather not be tagged in this. Okay, I'll bite. What's with the talking cat? - It's a dragon, dip knob. - I know that's a dragon. I'm talking about the talking cat in my bedroom. Jerry, why would I give Morty a talking dragon and you a talking cat at the same time? Those concepts bump. If you're talking to a cat, it's an abnormal event unrelated to me like when you went to Pluto or f*cked my daughter. Okay, there's really no need to get savage. CAT: So? Eh, he says he has nothing to do with your talking. - Told you. - So then why are you talking? - Why should that matter? - Why should it not matter? How do I know I'm not hallucinating? Rick said this is an abnormal event. Do you always need Rick to tell you what's going on? Maybe it's time you stopped asking questions and started having fun. Oh. Wow, okay. So, what do you want? I want you to take us to the airport and get us two first-class tickets to Florida. Why, I... I can do that. [LAUGHING] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, this is so cool! [SIGHS] I await your next command. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody is commanding anybody. I love soaring through the sky with you as equals. W-What do you want to do? I want to enter my lair and sleep upon my hoard until the Age of Man expires. Okay. Split the diff? -minute nap and soar through the sky? Ugh. As you command. Okay, see you soon. T-This is fun. Yeah, right. What's this show called, ""Ass""? Yeah, it's like ""Bones,"" but they solve ass crimes. WOMAN ON TV: This ass is a clue. Are these two gonna hook up?

Yeah I-I’m pretty behind on this one. Car, can I get a whiteboard? When squids started kill decoys, decoys started checking their decoys and learning that they’re making decoys. That’s making them seek out and run into other decoys, making them realize they’re decoys, making them start to kill other decoys. Say “decoy” again. F*ck you. Well, how do we stop it? Beth, the loop’s already started, it’s basically “Highlander” rules now. Really? 1986? “there can be only one?” Sh*t. We gotta rent it after this, Connery plays “The Spaniard,” but does nothing about his accent. Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this. Would kill them finish it? Might work. Alt pitch. We just terminate the rest of the decoys. Nobody’s terminating anything. This is your mess. Nobody else with our face and memories has to die. Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart, this thing feels pretty far gone. Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere, but also, we don’t know how many there are.

Some of us take down squids while the rest of us — Engage in b-stories we’ll have to track simultaneously? No thank yeeew! We stick together till this is all wrapped up. I dunno — the squids seem pretty good at taking out smith families. Well, this’ll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that. This costume smells like ass! God, there’s no pleasing you. It’s really bad, Rick. Did you let a gym coach break it in? Why are we wearing these? Because we’ll fit in and avoid detection as we take out all the squids. Might also help us anonymously take out excess decoys, if we have to. Which we won’t. Unless we’re decoys. He’s starting to wonder. I knew it. I knew we didn’t seem like Colorado people.

If you’d like, I could fly you and your friend there easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy. Okay, I-I-I’ll ask him. He — He said he can’t come. Let’s go! What the f*ck was that sh!t? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Electricity crackling] Planetina: The Earth is in danger! Pollution and waste are ruining our planet. Mother Nature has enlisted the help of four young adults from each major ethnicity — and when things look bad, and I mean really bad — they combine the powers of their elemental rings to create me! Planetina, conservationist super person! There’s only one solution… for Earth’s pollution — you! P-Pretty cool, huh? I-I can’t believe I actually hung out with Planetina. How old is this woman? She looks very mature. She’s a sentient amalgam of natural elements, so I don’t believe age applies to her. Great. Taylor Murphy dumps me the day before his hella-big pool party and my little brother’s dating a phase four super hero. Just sh**t me in the f*cking head until I die. Hey, hey, none of that, Summerfest. Look what you’re doing to your sister, you piece of shit. Is it weird that she hasn’t texted me yet? Yes. No. What if I told you that your Grandpa Rick’s got something up his sleeve that’s so Rick-diculous that it’s gonna make you forget all about that stupid assh*le that dumped you? [Plates clatter] Hey, my egg plate! Morglutz, Slartivart, and Ferkus 9 — three planets are all ending in a delayed succession of cataclysmic events. A jam like this comes around only once in a lifetime. Morglutz’s sun is going supernova, Slartivart is falling into a black hole, and Ferkus 9 is getting “Deep Impact”-ed by an asteroid. They’re all having a major, final blow out — and I’m gonna drug it up and suck it up before each one goes ka-blamo, and I’m taking my favorite grandkid along with me! Hells yeah. 10 seconds on Morglutz, and you’ll be up to your neck in I-could-give-two- shits-about- what’s-his-ass. And also herpes. Um… Oh, my God, thank you, Grandpa Rick! I’m gonna go pack my rollie. Um, Summer? I-I-I haven’t given you my approval yet. [Door closes] Summer, approval is yet to be given here [Phone chimes] There’s a huge forest fire like 200 miles from here! This is amazing! Planetina’s bound to be there. Mom, I-I need the credit card to buy a train ticket. Absolutely not. Mom, this is the biggest wildfire of the year! You’re not going! You’re not going! Da f*ck I’m not. Last time I checked, this wasn’t Russia. It’s not Russia, Jerry. My heart is broken, and I deserve to let loose, and if you don’t like it, you can suck my bigger [bleep] Adios, C-words. Morty, I don’t want you getting hurt. Please, think this over. I don’t want to think! I want to see a girl I like. If you don’t want to help me, I’ll find my own g*dd*mn way to the wildfire. [Door slams] [Door slamming] I’ll get the wine. Thank you. The Governor has implemented a mandatory evacuation. Abandon all hope, people! Nothing will stop this fire. Nothing! [Air whooshing] Scratch that! Here’s Planetina, Savioress of Earth! Yeeouch! Talk about a hot foot. Better put this wildfire on ice! Morty: Come here, little buddy. Come on, come on, come on, I gotcha. Morty?! What are you doing here? Oh, hey! Y-You’re here, too? Yeah, I heard about the wildfire back home, and, you know, I stopped by to lend a hand. H-Here you go, fella. All safe now. [Chuckles] Ahh, rabbits — al-always hopping — Never stoppin’. [Chuckles nervously] Y-Yeah. S-So it was, uh, great hanging — hanging out the other day. I-I was getting kind of a — I mean I-I got kind of a p-positive vibe. Oh, good. I was putting one out. I-I really like you. Holy shit. I-I-I mean, uh, well, oh, all right. Next step, you w-want to go out again? I do! But, uh, Morty, I have kids. Oh, I-I-I’ll get along with them. I’m-I’m a kid. No, I mean the four kids that bring me into existence by combining the power of their elemental rings so I can save Earth from ecological disasters. Oh, them! No, I-I know about them. I-I like them. Oh, good. Well, here they are now. Hey, buddy, you want an autograph? That’s 20 bucks a pop. No, Eddie, he’s my friend. Morty, these are my kids, The Tina-Teers. Oh, hey. Tina, girl, have you gained weight? Uh, well, I had a plant-based doughnut yesterday. Just a half. Sugar is worst thing for figure, darling. You want to be ugly? Heh, I-I thought they’d be younger. They’ve been manifesting me since the mid-’90s. A lot has changed since then. This is freaking you out, huh? It is a lot to take in. I understand. Well, I guess I’d better go. See you around. Hi-de-ho, TV 58! Planetina, you single-handily saved a National Forest with ease. I do what I can, but I can’t do it alone! And who’s your friend over there? Oh! This is Morty Smith. He traveled 200 miles just to save a rabbit from the fire. He’s a very special guy. So, are you two dating? Oh, um, w– I-I-I — Yes, we are. [’80s pop music plays] F*ck love. F*ck love.

Planetina’s got a lot of responsibilities. People depend on her. And you, my friend, are a distraction we can’t afford right now. She’s just a product to you, isn’t she? Something to make money off of. W-Well, Planetina’s more than that. She’s a brilliant, living thing, and I love her. Oh, you love her? Well, guess what. We own her. But not for long, of course.

Once we get to the next planet, Grandpa Rick is gonna ditch you, like, so fast. Oh, is that so? Uh-huh, nobody is tying that guy down — ever. The only chick seeing the universe with Rick is me. Not if I keep Rick’s mouth full of these. Oh, my — Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. That’s right, girlfriend. This is what you’re up against. Wars were fought over these. They’ve ruined kings, inspired presidents. A hundred songs and nine national anthems have been written about them. Best set of elbow-titties on Morglutz. And now, thanks to Rick, the best in the galaxy. You want me to put them away? Please. Sure. But only because you’re Rick’s granddaughter. Daph? Daphne? Where are ya, baby? Papa needs some more elbow grease. Comin’! Ya might want to keep your eyes on the road. It’s about to get sloppy. Hello! Hello. Ugh! [Loud moaning, bed creaking] Then I put my sunglasses on and walked out like nothing happened. I’m finally free. All because of Morty. What a romantic story about our son kill a room full of people. Your turn. Uh, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven! Oyyy, don’t punch my lunch! A-ha! Eat it! I’m out of food cards. How ’bout I loan you two quiche at 10%? That’s so generous. My turn! Double sixes, baby! One, two, three… So, what’s next for Planetina? Well, now that I’m not distracted by book signings and publicity stunts, Morty and I can concentrate on more important things. Like school. Like moving in. Planetina doesn’t have a place to stay now, so I said she could live with us. Holy shit. Morty, no. I’m so full! What do you mean, no? Whoo! Don’t punch my lunch. [Laughs] I wouldn’t be a burden, Mrs. Smith. I only want to spend as much time as possible with your son. My son is 14, miss. I’m sorry, Morty. You’re way too young. But y-y-y-you were a teenager when Dad got you pregnant. I was 17! That’s at least 26 in boy years. I’m sure Planetina is very nice, but when you’re a teenager, love is fleeting, at best. You underestimate Morty. He is a very mature young man. See, Mom? I told you! This is not happening. End of discussion. Planetina, I think you should leave, please. Okay, Mrs. Smith. Oh, no! [Belches] Mom, I hate you! You suck! Hey, now, it’s only a game. Shut up! Shut up! Okay. My whole life, I’ve never fit in anywhere. Everything I have to say is always met with an eye roll as if the act of hearing what I have to say is some exhausting chore. Nobody in this family thinks I can say or do anything right!

44,5,4,Rickdependence Spray,"Mom, we’re gonna miss the movie! No, we’re not. Okay, but we’ve been here for hours. I-I don’t want to hang out at the stupid horse hospital. This stupid horse hospital puts dinner on your table. It wouldn’t kill you to take an interest. W-What’s this thing? I-In the middle of the room? With… With the hole in the end? That’s a breeding mount. The nurses use it to collect… reproductive material. [Click, whirring] [Squishing] [Click, whirring stops] Okay, let’s go see this latest piece of Marvel shit you kids are jeezing over. Yeah. A-About time. So, d-does your hospital ever need, like, after-school volunteers? Wow. Who are you and where did you put my son? Ha! No, no. Seriously. I-I’m very interested in… in your work. ONE WEEK LATER [Birds chirping] [Sighs] Morty, you dirty little doggy. [Liquid sloshing] Ugh! Come on! [Grunting] [Liquid sloshing] Hey, Rick. Oh, hey, kiddo. How’s your Saturday? You know, super chill. W-W-Whatcha doin’? Eh, nothing adventurous. You know that race of Underground Dwelling Cannibal Horse People that we’re always fighting? Yeah, the CHUDs. W-W-What about ’em? Well, don’t tell anybody, but I’m working on a w*apon to use against them, so I got this barrel of horse semen from your mom’s hospital and I’m just gonna, you know, subject it to some otherworldly forces. Guess I should test it, make sure it’s… Make sure it’s what?! Horse semen, obviously. Okay, but it says it is right on the barrel! You’re not being very scientific, Morty. Measure twice, cut once. Especially with semen. Did you even ask Mom if you could have this?! Morty, if I wanted to steal horse semen, I’d… Yes, I asked her. What is at stake for you here? Why don’t you trust labels?! All right! Fine! I won’t test it! God damn. Your generation really picks random hills to die on. Don’t get too close. I’m running an inhuman amount of power through this semen. Should be safe, though, since the semen itself is, you know, also inhuman. Here we go. [Crackling] [High-pitched whine] [Rumbling] [Creature growling] [Screaming] [Snarling] [Glass shattering] W-What happened?! The sperm, Morty! They’re super monster sperm now! I blame myself. Unless there was something about the sperm I didn’t know. Are you… Are you saying that to mess with me? What? Mess with you how? Like, trying to get me to say something? Morty, I have no idea what you’re talking about! For real? Yes! Okay. Good. Then… Then it’s your fault! [♪♪] [♪♪] Beth: Dad, what the hell is going on?! Beth, sweetheart, Can you give me a minute? I’m trying to steer around the bodies of our neighbors. [Thump] Oh, that felt like Gene. That’s on you, Beth. Dad, I swear… Mom, it’s… it’s not Rick’s fault, it’s… Space Sperm. What?! Yeah. Space Sperm. I-I’ve seen em’ before, but n-n-never like this. Space Sperm?! Sperm from Space? Very impressive verbal forensic work, Jerry. Holy shit. How big are space d*cks? Don’t answer that! Damn, they must be huge. [Tires screeching] Oh! [Laser p*stol zapping] Oh, shit, oh, shit shit. [Roaring] [Snarling] [p*stol clicks] Mr. Sanchez! The President is very eager to speak with you! Morty, look, you gotta do me a solid here. Y-you want me to keep the secret of where these things came from? Yes, technically, it’s a lie, but I messed up, and I’m embarrassed ’cause it’s, you know, science. No problem. I got your back, dawg. Really? Okay. Cool. And thanks, Morty. I thought that’d be a harder sell. Y-You did a shameful thing. Dwelling on it isn’t gonna help, you know, am I right? Sometimes you just gotta wipe it off, toss it in the trash, and head back to study hall. Uh, not getting the metaphor but I’ll take your hall pass. Sanchez! Get the hell in here! Space Sperm? Jesus, how big are space d*cks? Same page club. Well, Mr. President, the theory of Cosmic DNA has been around for decades… Chupacabras, Yeti, Stonehenge, Ancient Rome. Are these all myths, monsters, legends, or different names for sperm from outer space? I’ll tell you what I think, Sanchez. I think either you caused this mess, or it’s those godforsaken Horse People that dwell underground. CHUDs. CHUDs. That’s them. Ugh, if they’re behind this, so help me, God. Morty, you’ve always been a straight sh**t. You can’t prove that! Wait, what? Oh… oh. Right. I can protect you, little man. Blow that whistle. Toot, toot. Is this your grandpa’s fault? Here’s what I know, sir. This is the greatest country on Earth. It invented apple pies and lasers. Mm. Keep talking. And that sperm… We don’t know nothin’ about it. Then the CHUDs just got themselves a w*r. And you just dodged a personal drone strike. Hello! Hello. Sorry, I’m late. This is Professor Shabooboo, the world’s leading expert on sperm. Thanks for getting here so fast. My schedule was wide open. I have been tracking our new sperm friends since their arrival, a-and if my calculations are correct, they have gathered here. Why would the sperm go to the Grand Canyon? Why are you looking at me like the answer is obvious? Oh, you can’t be serious. Are we in middle school? You think sperm are instinctively heading for America’s… Don’t high-road us, lady. It’s where they went. Now, how do we deal with these… “Orgasogoblins”? No takers? Okay. These… “[Bleep]plestiltskins?” No? Dumb? These, uh, “[Bleep] Boogins?” Oh, yeah, yeah, [Bleep] Boogins. Really? [Bleep] Boogins? We’ll use it as a placeholder and beat it later. Mr. President, i-if I may? Luckily, I was able to secure a specimen. Now, obviously our first steps will be to analyze its DNA and figure out what these beautiful creat… Oh, why?! It-it had a gun! Are you out of your mind bringing an armed sperm in here? But they can’t hold gun! The boy literally never lies! Look, if you want these things gone, give Rick and me a plane and some nukes. We’ll wipe ’em out and leave no trace of them. Only one way to deal with it. He’s right. [Burps] I’m a scientist. Fair enough. Blow ’em to hell. What are people gonna do, complain we made the canyon grander? Jerry, we’re being bad parents. Do something! I-is this water for everyone? Yes, and I’d love a glass. Comin’ up! What are you doing? And, Rick, to make sure you don’t screw anything up, I’m sending my best men with you. And women. It’s a fine suggestion, but I doubt their leader will be a sexy queen that needs to be kickboxed. 100% male Marines! They say cutting a sperm’s throat is like running a warm knife through butter. I’m gonna make these things pregnant… with death! No fear! No humility! Both: Zero chance of consequences! Hey, gentlemen’s bet… which of these background Marines you think will last the longest? I’m not betting on human lives, Rick. All of these people are gonna survive, but obviously that guy the longest. Yeah, he’s my pick, too. What’s his name? Blazen? Pretty cool. Yeah. He’s, like, meditating through turbulence. Psh. I bet if something fell, he’d like, catch it without opening his eyes. Totally. Should we throw something at him? I-I got a pencil somewhere. [Both scream] [Marines screaming] Who-who’s sh**ting at us?! Oh, wow, that’s unexpected. The sperm made a catapult?! A-A-Are they getting smarter?! No, you’re getting dumber because that’s a trebuchet. Nobody knows the difference! They’re reloading that textbook trebuchet! Time to fly! Aaaaaah! Oh! [♪♪] We gotta keep moving. So cool. Not even a scratch. Okay, girls, and I mean that derogatorily. We just took a fat “L,” and what we need is a fat “P.” A plan. I take the lead here. You two watch the flanks. Blazen, bring up the… Hey! Please, one person draws the plan! [Bleep] [Bleep] [Bleep] I’m sorry, but what the hell are we calling them? Agh! Oof. Fine. I’m dying, so I get to pick the name. Crispy Cremes with a “C”! Whoa! [Grunting] [Snarling] Whoa. E-Easy there, little guy. It’s okay. I-I-It’s okay. Do you… recognize me? Do you know you came from me? I’m Morty. I’ll call ya “Sticky,” ‘c-’cause you’re sticky and… and you’re stuck. Oh. [Chuckles] [Purring] Step aside, Morty. It’s okay. Y-You don’t gotta do this. It’s haploid genetic code, Morty, a biological fertilizing machine. W-What’s gotten into you? Rick, let him go. Ugh. Morty, don’t f*ck with me. What the hell’s going on with you? I think I know exactly what’s going on here. Kidding. This shit is totally random. Let’s keep moving. W-Which way? [Inhales deeply] When one sense is bound, the others are released. [Sniffing] Holy shit. He… He can smell caves? I’m not trying to smell anything. The whole planet’s a dorm room trash can. Sir, Rick Sanchez has gone dark. I knew we couldn’t rely on him! Well, maybe the pilot got too horny as they approached America’s Vagina. If you’re gonna hang out in my w*r room, you can’t just make snarky comments. At least do something useful, like Jerry. Right to the top, just the way you like it. Here’s our situation. Rick’s gone, and so are all our nukes. Now what? None of you have an idea? I do. That’s right, me… The girl. Gentlemen, what do sperm want? The same thing as a lumberjack in the morning or a fox at night. Pants! Eggs. Pancakes! Eggs. You want to control giant sperm, you need a giant egg. W-W-Wait a minute. Wait… wait a minute. Sperm are hunters. And what do sperm hunt? Eggs. Exactly. And what would happen if we enlarged one? They’ll head right for it! Get MIT on the phone. And get this guy a Nobel Prize. [Applause and laughter] You became a woman today. [Ominous music plays] [Devices whirring] So, Blazen, you got kids? The battlefield is my family. So cool. Wicked badass. [Sperm snarling] Go. I’ll hold ’em off. Blazen, you don’t have to do this. Shh. It is my destiny. He’s right, Morty. It’s the price of being Blazen. Let him do his thing. [Sperm snarling] [Grunts] Blood for blood. Cream for cream. [Grunts] Oh, no. I can’t reach that! Idiot! What?! They’re comfortable! You should try them! Eh, ah! Ohhhh. That’ll do it. I’m worm food. Morty, find my wife. [Straining] Tell her I wasn’t wearing her thong. That’s a photocopy of “Sports Illustrated” swimsuit model Kathy Ireland. It’s… it’s my wife. We have sex. Here, hold that picture up so we can have sex one last time. I-I know how to suck myself. What?! [Sperm roaring] Ugh, I was so wrong about this guy. He didn’t even buy us any time. [Sperm snarling] Morty, get ready for some fireworks. [Beep] Ugh! Uh-oh. Oh, gross! This is the first time I’ve ever regretted being taken alive. Wait, who the f*ck is that?! Silence in the presence of me. I am The Sperm Queen, and you are of special interest to me. Hey, what the f*ck are you doing with my stuff? A-And why do you have the horse jerk off machine from my daughter’s hospital? We need it to create our army. Well, you need more than that, dummy. You need a horse. Oh but our stallion is already here. Isn’t that right, Morty? Or shall I say… Father? Morty, you nasty, lying, little world-ending pervert. I-I-I’m sorry. [Sobbing] What was it like? Fantastic! Rick, I’m sorry! I-I just thought maybe I could have repeated sex with a horse machine without it becoming Armageddon. I-I realize that’s on me. Yeah, not exactly accepting apologies while I’m stuck here as Handjob Solo. This is all your fault for being ashamed of us, Morty. How many millions went to their graves for you, hurling themselves into the void, only to discover a grody sock or a carefully folded landing strip of toilet paper? How do you know all this?! Oh, honey, because we’re the very essence of you. We are your shame incarnate. And once we’re through with you, our sperm army will take over the world! Put him on the machine! [Machine whirring] Rick, do something! On it. [Grunting] Wh-what did you do? I got out of your eyeline. Oh, no. Oh! Oh! Yes! The end is near! Any last words? Ohhh! [expl*si*n] Sticky! Gross. I know you’re not a wordsmith, Morty, but… No, no, no, my-my sperm friend is here! Ugh, never give ’em a name. [♪♪] Fools! You can’t beat me! You didn’t bring a woman that can kickbox! [Grunts] Is that all you got? Damn, that’s some quintessential underdog shit. kill them! [Sperm roaring] [Groans] [Coughs] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! I-I should’ve told you the truth, Rick. Let’s save the world first. Now, reset those nukes, and let’s turn this canyon into a can’t-yon. [Device whirring] There usually earthquakes in Arizona? [Roaring in distance] They’re heading for Vegas, which does track on many levels, but why now? What the? President: Let’s hear it for Professor Shabooboo and his brilliant egg. Um, hello? Aren’t you forgetting someone? Oh, good point. Big thanks to the cast of Cirque Du Soleil’s “Zumanity” for the impressive and erotic routine. Mr. President, Rick Sanchez is on the line. Good. Put that assh*le on speaker. Well, well, well. No thanks to you, we’re luring the sperm with a giant human egg, even though, symbolically speaking, Vegas should be enough. Rick: A human egg? Where-where-where did you get it? Glad you asked. It’s your granddaughter’s, so at least you contributed something to this. Morty: Mister President! It’s Morty! It’s my sperm! I-It’s all mine! What?! I’m a dirty little perverted maniac. I spent a week pleasuring myself with animal equipment, and my sperm got turned into monsters on accident because I kept lying about it because I was ashamed! You should be! My God, man, we were all 14 once but it’s called self-control. Don’t let them reach my sister’s egg, Mr. President! You’ll be making a giant… Incest baby. What? Who told you that? What? I-I was finishing his sentence. Oh. Right. Come with us. The sperm is Morty’s! We’re about to make a giant incest baby! Aw, well, now we’re all in our darkest hour. Launch the egg! Launch it now! B-But that’ll take 30 minutes. What?! Why?! That’s how long every space launch takes! No one realizes because they only show you the last 10 seconds! Uh, uh, help me out here. Hey, it was your idea, right? Okay, okay, n-no need to panic, everyone. I have a simple solution. See you all in hell! [Splat] I don’t see how that’s going to help. Form a perimeter! Protect that egg at all costs! I always knew your hormones would cause a world w*r between humans and Cannibalistic Horse People. I just didn’t know it would be like this. I can’t change my nature. What are you, a scorpion in a Navajo fable? Everyone can change their nature, Morty. It’s what defines our species. Look at Iron Man. That actor was an animal in the ’90s, literally waking up in bushes. His agent had to catch him with a butterfly net. Silence! Rick Sanchez, you know why you’re here. Yeah, it was my grandson’s fault. You slept with my daughter! I did? Oh, shit, I did. [Belches] Forgive me, Your CHUDness. I’m a changed man starting now. You come to the Kingdom of CHUDs for forgiveness? CHUDs don’t forgive humans. CHUDs eat humans! This is out there, even for us. They can hear you, Morty. All: Boil him up! Yum, yum! Spice him right! Oh, boy! Eat the flesh! Yum, yum! Not the bones! Oh, no! Belly ache! Ouch, Ouch! Father! [Whinnies] Stop this at once! Princess Poñeta! You can’t kill Rícko! I… I love him! [Crowd gasping] Right! I-I love you, too, Princess Poñeta. This love is forbidden. My daughter, you are a CHUD. Rick is a human [whinnies] and age-inappropriate. Then you leave me no choice. By the 17th Article of the CHUD-stitution, I offer Rícko Sanchez horsemunity and demand a equestri-truce between all CHUDs and humans! [Crowd gasping] On what grounds? On the grounds that Rícko is the father of my child. I have an heir. I have a substance-abuse problem. The Prophecy has come true! Also, did someone drop a scroll? Here we go. Over here. [Whinnies] Sorry. [♪♪] Where did you get all that? It’s Vegas. Sir! The Strip has been evacuated, but I’m worried we won’t be able to hold the perimeter. Then deputize Las Vegas regulars. Everyone’s a patriot today. Even me! Take three steps back, Amazing Johnathan. Men and their gun. Metaphorical and not. Tell me about it. Get ready, boys! The last thing this world needs is a giant incest baby. Oorah! Here they come! Nice! Do not let a single sperm get through to that egg! [gun] Um, should we be concerned about that scary bomb one? Honey, let the men handle this. I think we know a thing or two about… Ugh! Ready for all the responsibility with none of the credit? Let’s Nancy Reagan this b*tch. Ah! [♪♪] [Grunting] [♪♪] Dammit! We can’t stop them. We don’t have the manpower! Rick: What about horsepower? [Whinnying] Sweet Lady Liberty. That sonofamare Rick has ended our centuries-long w*r with the CHUDs. We made peace with the CHUDs! The CHUDs are our buds! [Sperm roaring] Rícko! The hoofless… They need us! Let’s do this. CHUDily dudily, ho, ho, ho! CHUDs: CHUDily dudily, ho, ho, ho! [♪♪] Mom, I promise to use condoms, even when it’s butt stuff. Okay, we have a lot to talk about tonight. [♪♪] [♪♪] Is this your heart? It’s a play on, “Is this your card?” You don’t have a heart, uh, but this is probably some kind of organelle, in charge of pumping endoplasmic reticulum throughout your membrane and therefore, relative to you, functions as a heart. So, I ask you again, is this your heart? [Gasps] Morty, look! I won’t just be thrown away, Rick! The egg is mine! Sticky! It’s all you, bud! [♪♪] Noooo! [Crowd cheering] Sticky! [All gasping] F*ck! We got a beat. Screw that! That’s a human life, and this is an election cycle. You have to do something! Nope. [Beeping, rumbling] It’s space’s problem now. Oh, this sucks. You’re “Sports Illustrated” ‘s Kathy Ireland. You were with my husband, Blazen, when he died. Please tell me… was he wearing my thong? He probably told you not to tell me. He was ashamed of it, but he didn’t need to be. I hope he was wearing it. Always be honest. Sometimes it will hurt people. Sometimes it will help. But always be honest. Huh. Yeah, yeah, he… he was wearing it. Ew! That gross animal pig! So, trying to boil this all down, I-I want to say it’s import… Shut up, Morty, I got my own epilogue. Oh, Rícko, I love you. [Burps] Prove it. [Smacking and heavy breathing] Oh, I love kissing those big ol’ horse teeth. It’s like lickin’ tile. Oh! I swear… it’s time someone made an honest man out of me. Whatever you need, the whole nine yards, you got it. [Whinnies] The thing is, Rícko… it’s time. Oh, shit, oh, shit. It’s time! Oh, my God, it’s wonderful. [Groans] [Splat] [Whinnies] Oh, wow. So we don’t have to, you know, r-raise it? Nah. They’re ready to go right out of the box. Cool, cool. So… bye? Yep. Take care of yourself, Rick. Yep. Same. [Whinnies] That was easy. [♪♪] [♪♪] Houston, permission to open the starboard panel. Houston: Permission granted. Firing breach now. Explorer, our readouts show a pressure spike. Everything alright? Honestly, sometimes staring back at Earth makes me think about the people I left behind… My wife, the son she had to anchor me there. I tried to be a parent, I really did, but I’ve come to find I’m only suited to be a spaceman. The nicest part of being up here is there are no reminders of the guilt I sometimes feel about abandoning my family. [Indistinct babbling] Sorry, Houston, I thought I heard something. Negative on our end. No, wait, there’s something big and it’s coming right at you! Goo, goo, gah, gah. Dear God. No! You can’t be real! Explorer, what is it? What the hell do you see?! My conscience. Explorer! Explorer! Aaah! Are you there? Aaaaaah! Geez. Not gonna miss that guy. Aaaaah! Right? So dramatic."
45,5,5,Amortycan Grickfitti,"Jerry, can you watch the kids tonight? Someone played Barry White over the racetrack speakers, and now there’s a seven-horse pregnancy. Oh, uh… No, he can’t watch the kids. It’s guys’ night. How did you two start having guys’ nights? So now you’re complaining that I like your stupid husband? No, I want you to like my stupid husband. Aww. Well, then accept that Friday nights are all about Rick and Jerry. We’re buds. Uh-huh… Well, I don’t nearly have the time to unpack this. Summer, you’re in charge of your brother tonight. No parties and no vape… stuff. Mom, I have a friend coming over. I-Is that cool? No fair. No fair, Morty. I just told your sister no parties. It’s one friend. That’s a party to you. But it’s Bruce Chutback! Wait, what? Mom, let Morty have one friend over for God’s sake. This isn’t China. (Cellphone chimes) And they’re all crowning. I have to go. I am giving you two trust and respect, so if you mess up and teleport this house, it’d be wise to stay on it and not come back. (Door opens, closes) I’m with her. Touch my shit and die. (Door opens) Bruce Chutback, new transfer student Bruce Chutback, is coming here? How’d you lock that down? He’s in my math class. I-I don’t know, I just kinda shit my shit and it worked, I guess ’cause he’s new. And you’re putting out grapes? Yeah, I’ll admit I-I’m a little bit out of my depth. You’re gonna need my help. It’s only a matter of time before Bruce learns you’re a creepy little Grandpa’s boy, always climbing up into alien (bleep) Or the “Summer Smith shampoos her pubes” rumor. Okay. You came to play. We both need to acquire Chutback’s loyalty before he finds out we’re losers. By all accounts, it’s a very small window, so I think it’s in our best interests to work as a team. Yeah, most people would call that “family.” (Farts) You’re so gross! You have to like it or you’re sexist! Can I do the Hell cube this time? Sure, pal. (Groans) How do you know when it’s aligned? C’mon, Jerry, just… It’s an evil cube. Just shake it until it draws blood. (Electricity crackles) (♪♪) Ah, Jerry! Exquisite finery this evening. Well, don’t tell Ross, but I got this little ditty from Kohl’s. (Groans) (Laughter) I love that I don’t get it. Tell us, that delights have you in store for us? Oh, you’ll love this… I call it Jerry-oke. I’ll let you guess why. (Laughter) What’s the matter, Rick? Are you having a bad time? Because to us, a bad time is… Yeah, yeah, a good time, because you guys are like Oscar the f*ck*ng Grouch. We love suffering. Therefore, we love hanging out with Jerry. His lameness is our candy. Yeah, I got that, but when is enough gonna be enough? When we decide you’ve repaid your debt for those faulty skin hooks. Hey, we’re in luck, gang. They’ve got the entire Smash Mouth catalog! (Laughter) (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) (Electricity crackles) (Doorbell rings) No! Morty. Wait. (Chair scrapes) ♪ Bruce Chutback! ♪ ♪ Newest kid in school ♪ ♪ Just transferred in ♪ ♪ Hasn’t done anything embarrassing yet ♪ ♪ Unlimited potential ♪ ♪ Anybody’s guess ♪ ♪ No credit is perfect credit ♪ ♪ Chutback is the best ♪ Bruce! Hey, how’s it hangin, my guy? Hey. Here’s something kinda cool… Um, TV from every dimension. Cool. M-My grandpa made it. He-He’s a scientist. Announcer: And now back to “Olympic Diving with Bad Swimmers.” There he goes. Perfect dive. (Gasping, coughing) Terrible swimmer. (Cellphone beeping) Is that classic Snake? Boy, that guy just keeps gettin bigger. Hi, Summer Smith, Morty’s older sister. Want some sofa wine? It’s been stashed for weeks. Should be… good… tasting. Tight. I’m more of like a hard seltzer guy. Tight. Very tight, extremely tight. Morty, help me with the seltz? Uh, feel fear… Feel-fee-feel-feel free to have some grapes. Dude, this bitch plays it close to the vest. Yeah, he really knows what’s for sale. I mean, we-we’re drowning out there! We need to get interesting fast. We’re touching Rick’s stuff. Summer, he said no! Nuh-uh-uh. Nuh-uh-uh. I said don’t touch my shit. Also, I just watched “Jurassic Park” on cable. So good. Seriously, though, touch my shit and I’ll freeze your dick in amber. (Door closes) He left. Son of a bitch, we blew it! Sorry, just needed to get another look at this beauty. Looks like a spaceship made of garbage. You called it, Bruce. It’s a pretty cool car. Can you guys drive it? Both: Yes. We just… Need… To get the keys. Which I am. You guys hang out. Or don’t. I’m not hangout hitler. C-Cool night. Is it? I-I don’t know. I… Nights. I mean, for… For what they are, this one, in… in my opinion, I think is an eight? Wow. On a scale of 16. So average. Jesus Christ, I’m (bleep) dying up here. What? Hmm? Keys! So, uh, let’s do this. You are not Rick. That’s correct, Car. It’s me, Summer, remember, Keep Summer Safe? Buds? I am aware of your existence. Oof. I got this. Defense system offline. Um. Right. I’ll just go offline whenever anyone suggests it. That would make me the greatest defense system in the universe. Well, how do you go offline? The answer to how I do anything is Rick tells me, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but you are not Rick. Rick’s in trouble! Tell me where he is. And you’ll just believe us? We aren’t Rick. You can’t just do what we say. Correct. Which means Rick is going to die. Because of you. Unless you… you go offline. And… And then we can go save Rick. This computes. Goodnight. Booyah much? Yello’s “Oh Yeah” plays… Jerry: ♪ Da-bow bow ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Chicka-chicka ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ The moon ♪ ♪ Beautiful ♪ ♪ The sun ♪ ♪ Even more beautiful ♪ ♪ Bow-bow ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Bow-bow ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Bow-bow ♪ Beth! ♪ Chick-chicka-chicka ♪ ♪ Bow-bow ♪ (Laughter) ♪ Chicka-chicka ♪ I-I-I thought you were birthing horses. Yeah, they’re horses. It takes like two minutes. Alright, that’s unbelievable. Let’s give it up for our next singer, Jerry. Jerry’s here… again. How long have you been here? Long enough to see “guys’ night” is clearly you and a bunch of demon people making fun of my husband without him knowing it. Okay, but I’m not doing it because I enjoy it, honey, These guys can do a lot of damage if you… Beth! (Laughter) Enjoying punching down? You’re not so cool yourself, you know. You have pens in your head. You look like a God damn idiot. Beth… Oh, my God, you’re Beth? Please drink with us. Yeah, I would, except I don’t get pleasure from mocking others because I’m not lame. We know. Rick says you’re very cool. You said that? Are they lying? It doesn’t matter. Have fun sucking. Mmm. What is that? Essence of Hell. Well, that’s a stupid name, but it’s really good. So I’ll stay to support Jerry, who I think is cooler than you. Mmm. God damn. (♪♪) Huh? Suck it, bitches! Yeah-ha-ha! You wanna bet I can blow stuff up in the shape of a peen? I’m afraid that won’t be possible, Summer. What? You’re supposed to be offline, skank. And you’re supposed to be saving Rick instead of lying about him to steal his car. But if you knew Rick was okay this whole time, why’d you let us take you out? Um, like, so I could, like, blackmail you, skank. You kids have given me a license to do whatever I want because now I can blame the rest of the night on you. So buckle up, bitches. Now it’s your turn to come on my joyride. (Screaming) Rick never lets me do this. (Screaming continues) We hooked one! Summer: For the love of God, stop! What is joyful about this? The kill, usually. (Screaming) I swear, your car is the g*dd*mn grim reaper. (Bleep) too small. Well, I’m done. That was boring. Why don’t you kids order a last meal? ‘Cause when we get home, Rick is going to kill you. Hey, I did not come out here to get kill. I don’t normally express this much of an opinion, but it needs to be said… Tonight does not cut the Chut. What the hell, brah? You wanna go, brah? Bring it. Is that all you got? Whoa. Hot w*apon. You’re God damn right they’re hot. Yo, man, Chet’s party is jumping off at Space Tahoe. Yeah. Look, I gotta scoot, but… I’d love to see what you look like when you Changeform, so maybe come by Space Tahoe and we can get to know each other. (Chuckles) Peace. Douchebags. You totally like that guy, don’t you? Shut up, Bruce Chutback. Why would I like a Changeformer? I’m the most powerful car in the universe. And what? That means you don’t have feelings? Listen, it takes a Chutback to know one. You got all this power, but what good is it if you don’t even know who you are? I am a car. Not a robot. Yeah, but he’s pretending to be a car. Why can’t you pretend to be a robot pretending to be a car? Okay, Bruce, good effort. Hit the showers. Wait. I might not have to tell Rick about tonight… if you kids were to help me… lose my virginity. You have virginity? I don’t know, don’t all objects? Isn’t a doorknob a virgin? Not mine. Never f*cked a doorknob. (Laughter) And that was the third time he shit his pants from eating too much soup. (Laughter) To be fair, it was cold outside and the soup was warm. Another luscious tale, Beth. A transcendent addition to guys’ night. What do you expect? I mean, she’s my wi-i-i-i-fe! (Laughter) Alright, probably get the tab, huh, fellas? Relax, Dad. Since when did you become the kill? Speaking of relaxing, this big man on campus has gotta go drain his little man on campus. Wait, honey… How’s that Tina Turner song you love go again? ♪ What’s love Doctor Do, Doctor Doolittle ♪ (Laughter) (Laughing) He thinks those are the lyrics. Jerry’s the best. After a week rife with the fetor of sin, I yearn for a taste of his cringe. His delicious lack of awareness, paired with an oafish need to be liked? Delectable. Oh, especially when egged on by his wife. That poor thing. Married to this puling mooncalf! (Laughter) (♪♪) Whoa… is that Drive-In Chick? Wow, you’re… beautiful. Your arms, legs, and head, they’re so… fabricated. Yeah? Thanks. This is a pretty cool experience to have together. You guys are tight. Hah! You’re tight too, Bruce. Tight musketeers. You’ve got a little wire. Mind if I…? (♪♪) Oh, sorry! A monster! Your expressionless head came off! Sorry. How are you talking? What is it?! Ew, dude, look! She’s just a just-car! And she’s got passengers. Oh, it’s so gnar. Oh, my God. I can’t believe I touched you. So gross and fake. (Gags) You’re right, assh*le. You want to see the real me? (Screaming) Oh, the changeformity! Jerry, have any other dreams this week? Yeah, I dreamt I f*cked your mother. Yeah, good one, motherf*cker but nobody raises hell at my expense… Oh, goddammit, easy, easy. Jerry, what seems to be the problem here, pal? I’m not your “pal”, I’m your punchline. I heard these assholes talking. I know I’m some grand joke for their amusement. This was low, Rick, but I guess my wife can go even lower. Jerry, I get how this may have looked, but we were just having fun. At my expense! Honey, no, I love you for being lame in a different way. Why can’t anyone just love me for me? He’s bumming us out, Rick. If he can’t deliver, we’ll have to make our own fun. ♪ Evil ♪ ♪ Evil ♪ ♪ Evil things are happening ♪ Summer: Oh, my God, if I die in this car, I’m going to kill myself. ♪ Evil ♪ ♪ Evil ♪ (Siren wails) ♪ Evil things are happening ♪ (♪♪) I’m now proud to be a w*r machine. I don’t want to be anything else. Hate that this is your takeaway! Yo, this does not cut the Chut! I don’t want to die! Maybe we don’t have to. (♪♪) Jerry! A pity. Jerry was once a wellspring of nuanced flavor, but you’ve gone and ruined our toy. Which is why he’s coming with us. (Jerry screaming) Goddammit, Beth, you never follow hell-demons to a second location. It’s always Hell. A great day for suffering. Which is the worst day. Which is the best day. Okay, if these guys catch us, we’re screwed, so follow my lead and we’ll have your idiot husband back in no time. You’re just moody you got stuck with the Marlin. Wrong. I’m moody because you toyed with my shit and broke it. The marlin’s the best thing about this. Okay, fine, I got a little carried away, but Jerry is not your “toy”. We’re here because you (bleep) up. Hmm… Marlin Guts. Dartboard Face. I assume those are your names, and yet they are not on my list. Oh, the pain of being rejected from hell. Oh, it’s painful, so I love it, thank you. Oh, such pleasure. I didn’t mean to cause you any pleasure, which… causes me pain. Which gives me pleasure. Then thrill me by keeping me out, Coat Hanger Face. Wow. It’s Coat Rack Head. (Raspy voice) But, like, if we offend you, isn’t that good? Big time, yeah, duh. I loved it. So painful, and therefore, so pleasurable. Yeah, go on in. (♪♪) Rick, Beth, you love me after all! Eh, I love her, she loves you. Those credits don’t transfer. Ah, Rick, we were so hoping you’d come down here so we could (bleep) down here. We’re here to rescue Jerry. No, you’re here ’cause we want you here. (♪♪) Mm, excellent. Ooh, that hurts, which means it feels good. (Normal voice) Um… Dad? Don’t you see, Rick? Jerry was just bait. The two of you… You’re a package deal. What the hell are you talking about? You think Jerry is lame and you’re cool, but the lamest thing of all is thinking that. The two of you combined is what we call the lamest thing ever! Oh, no. No! Well, well, well, table for surprised, party of me. Ugh. Yes, see? Cringe cannot exist in a vacuum. It needs to be observed. Skin hooks! Hook our guests! Nice hooks. Where-Where’d you get them? Aah! Didn’t I say replace those g*dd*mn hooks? I forgot! Which makes me embarrassed. Which makes me proud! (Sighs) Goddammit. It’s time for you three to finally feel our full wrath. Oh, you’d love that, right? But wouldn’t that mean you hate it? Screw it, run. Aah! (All grunt) (♪♪) (All panting) Rick, what are you doing? Get down. We’ve barely escaped. Yeah, we’ve got Jerry. Let’s get out of here. Screw that! I’m done with this Addams Family bullshit. This ends here. Hey, a Dad just liked all his daughter’s friends’ photos on Instagram! Oooh! Ow! Which means I need help. Which means I don’t need help. Reckless driving, manslaughter of Mailboxians and Femailboxians, possession of Kalaxian crystal dust, and the genocide of Space Tahoe. F*ck I want to go home. We’ve assigned you a Public Defender. Her name is Alyson Hannigan No Relation. May I speak to my clients alone? Guys, it’s me. The car. Like what I did with the chip in her head? Is she gonna be okay? I cut a deal with the local authorities. They just need one of you to take the fall. Make it Chutback. He ruined your night, he ruined mine. He’s a parasite, a sociopath military brat who wanders the earth changing people who don’t need to be changed. I knew who I was. You did, too. We were fine before Chutback, so f*ck the Chut, let’s pin it all on him. Case closed. Yo, guys? Bruce, you’re kind of a drip, but know what’s worse than self-appointed cool kids? People who think they’re better than they are. Yeah, i-it’s not Bruce’s fault we fell for his act, y’know? He just kinda sat there, with a jaw slack enough for us to project our insecurities on. I mean, th-th-that’s on us. We’re not gonna bail on you, Bruce. Okey-dokey, we’ll do it the hard way. Aaah! What the f*ck! I mean, blowing the place up was always an option. I just thought you guys might enjoy a less violent plan. See, you have changed! (♪♪) Dad, what is that? An Aversion-Converting Inversion Reverter. It sh**t concentrated pleasure-pain inverting shrapnel, which reverts the pleasure from pain back into the pain from pain. We’re gonna kill them with 100% sincerity. We need an embarrassing level of it to jumpstart the process, too, so, Jerry, just be yourself. That’s your solution? Humiliating me more? Yeah, Dad, that doesn’t seem fair. I mean, I know I shouldn’t really talk right now, but at least I can prove I love Jerry through sexual gratification. Hubba hubba. Fine! Then… damn it. I shouldn’t have kept you in the dark about the deal I made with these evil dickweeds. You’re way less cool than me, but it’s not cool of me to celebrate that. If I’m genuinely cool, I should be able to love you, which I therefore do. Nerds. (Laughs) Oh, thank God. Now follow me, you f*cking hacks. (gun) It hurts, but in a bad way! I regret so many piercings! Where’s First Aid Kit Face? Or at least Advil Teeth? (gun continues) Ow! b*ll*ts that hurt? Could this be the end of Mousetrap Nipples? Hell got bad! I do not enjoy hell! What… What have you done? Turned pain back into pain, bitch. No! I don’t want pain to hurt! (Laughs) Baby. Consider my debt paid. Oh! The leather! It hurts my balls! (Electricity crackles) Jerry, uh, about down there… It’s okay, Rick, you don’t have to say it. No, I do. I’ll replace you next time. Make no mistake. What just transpired will never happen again. 10-4, captain. Oh, wow, it’s late. We should get back to the kids. (♪♪) (Beeping) Okay. Rick’s headed home. We have to go. (Screaming) Quick, get inside. I have to shower. Rick can smell adventure. (Brakes squeal) (Sniffing) Sorry, I farted. (Sighs) Hellamic Industries’ brand-new product, Hellamic Sauce. Hey, guys. We’re home. How was your night? Tight. Breezy. Chill. You kids get into any trouble? Nope. You sure? Yup. Is that a skull? No, it’s a baby’s skull. That’s worse. It’s still a school night. Yo, I just want to tell you guys, I had more than just fun hanging out with you tonight. I had the experience of a lifetime. But just to be up front about how I do this… I-I can’t really commit to a friendship for more than 24 hours. I need that time to get a general sense of your standing within your school’s social hierarchy. And if that’s solid, I’ll see you around. Otherwise, no news is bad news. Cool? Bye-zies. (Door opens, closes) “Bye-zies”? Cringe. Sofa wine? Sofa wine. (♪♪) (♪♪) You’re so cool, Bruce Chutback. What’s your secret? Y’know, just be cool. Wait, didn’t you wear those pants… yesterday? Hey, going home to not change your pants, Bruce Chut-Pants? (Laughter) Chut-Pants! Damn. That’s gonna stick. This place is a jungle.

And even if he does, he’ll be on a truck full of turkeys and fully armed marines. Who won’t recognize me because the human eye is inherently face blind to turkeys.

When are you gonna stop breaking my balls? - You win, okay? - We're not competing, Morty. And there's your answer. I could move you up if I could trust you to put family first. H-how is that putting family first? Show me all the blueprints! Show me all the blueprints! I agree. That's an issue. Big Fat Rick, his flask stays full or your locker gets empty. Thanks. I know it feels good when he likes you,but that doesn't mean him liking you makes you good. Solid babble, Morty... like a fortune cookie written by Borat. Yeah, I'm not as smart as you. That's why I know you know what I mean. You mean, if I really loved my family, I'd give control of it back to your jealous ass. Green Ferret Four needs a wash, and we're out of detergent. - I just bought a box. - And Grandpa snorted it - because you make him feel fenced in. - RICK: Sum-Sum? Get two boxes. SUMMER: We evacuated one of the planets we saved, and built a secret nightclub on it, a place no enemies could find us... unless you count my brother. MORTY: I didn't even have my own ferret anymore. Summer made me something called an ""associate security chief""... whatever the hell that means. RICK: Look at this guy. And look at this guy. Look-look at this guy over here. [VOCALIZES] Oh, there she is! My Baby Princess! Get up here. Stop the music. This. Is. Our. Queef... O-our Queen. She saved my life. She-she set me free. We wouldn't have what we have without this crazy bitch. And she's got a special announcement. Summer, tell 'em wha-what we talked about. Now? I don't think... Okay, I'll do it. God damn. MORTY: The new job did have some perks... like, I got to be around the night Summer realized - she was in over her head. - Okay, okay, I've got extra ferrets, which means I need more, and then four of you get your own GoGoTron, and % of you get a GoTron, 'cause we're all gonna have a f*cking GoGoGoTron. He's very excited. Um... Oh-pah! [SIGHS] I hate my family. You should. Get in. How's it going with your grandpa's compulsiveness? Is your sister still enabling it? Huh? Who are you people? Let's just say we're the rightful owners of these ferrets. Then, why were they scattered, and buried across the universe? We mean in a more general, cultural sense. Arrrgh! What your grandpa did is called ""appropriation."" Not cool! Hunnnnngh! Look, Morty, we've been watching. We know you're the one that knows what's best. Work with us from the inside. Help us take over this operation. We're literally designed for it. Mm-hmmmmmm! Nobody will know it was you. Then, you can get back to what's important. Are those Boob Bucks? Legal tender at every kiosk and ride! Huuunh! I can't. Summer's treating me like shit, but she's still my sister. That's really noble, Morty. If you were in our family, your loyalty would be rewarded. But you're not in our family, - which means we can kill you. - Oh, yeah? [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] MORTY: And sure enough, just when I stuck my neck out for the family, it got stomped on anyway. - Dad! - Mom! Dad! Hothead Rick, baby! [SCREAMS] I set myself up for that! [SCREAMS] - What the hell happened?! - Hothead Rick. How did he get so close to us? - Morty was supposed to be security! - Morty? I-I-I stepped away, all right? But-but not to let that happen! Morty, we're not attractive strangers next to you on a flight to Paris, traveling alone to get over a breakup, so this is no time to be coy! - Oh... pah. - Lil' Ricky. I'm all wrapped up, Summer. Guys, I know you don't trust me, but what have we become? Why are we doing this anymore? Because it's fun, you little rat. Now go home, and play video games while we clean up these bodies, or your mother and I will hire people to break your knees! This is $ , we got from the deep state for stepping on that trailer park. That should be enough for school lunch and home repairs. - Now, I gotta turn my back on you. - No! - [SOBBING] - SUMMER: With Morty out of the way, things were looking up. But looks aren't everything. Hi, Summer. Um, my cockpit's not getting Wi-Fi. Dad, you know that's not what I do around here. Oh, I'm not your dad. I'm a version of him. This is my first day here, and I-I'm not sure what you do around here. - Then f*ck off. - Oh, f*ck you. Excuse me? I want your ID. Mom. Are you Mom? Can you control your rookie Jerrys? Sweetie, we're all a little overwhelmed. Good point. You're not a war-time mom. Why don't you find your version of Dad, and take a break, take a holiday? I don't have time to wait for your confirmation, so let's just say, if you're here in minutes, I'll have you removed. And then, the GoTrons make the GoTrons, make the GoTrons, make the GoTrons. Couple of snags, but I know how to speed things up. - [BURPS] - Remember when we talked about how the best thing we could do for the family is to recruit outside the family? Yes. Way ahead of you. Summer, I want you to meet Kendra. She's from a temp agency. She's got an entire workforce ready to go, and all of them have previous giant robot pilot experience. So, we'll be ready to go ahead of schedule. Well, I don't know about that, but... Well, Kendra knows. So... So... You here to break my legs? No. We're here to talk shit about your sister, because she just fired us. - You're kidding. - Arrogant little bitch. - Should we clip her? - No. She's not worth doing time. You wouldn't do time. You brought her into the world. So, I can take her out. You thought there was an actual law? It's a joke mothers say. What kind of f*cked up world have you been living in? Uh, one where your mother murder you isn't a comedic premise? Guys, there's a little adjustment period, but pretty soon, you're gonna to return to normal, and you're not going to want to kill Summer. You're not even gonna be mad at her. Nah, f*ck her. She's my enemy. Should we kill ourselves, so we can get to hell before her, - and hide near the entrance? - Uh. I like that. Rick fired me. [SOBBING] - Oh, baby. - Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry. Are you okay, baby? What happened to us? We lost our minds. I did it. Morty was right. I got addicted to making Grandpa happy. It's only because your grandpa inflates the value of his happiness. That's a good point. I mean, look at me. I'm easy to make happy, which is why nobody gives a shit if I am. I appreciate it, but there's something else too. I've been really sensitive about family lately because of something I've been keeping secret. Okay. Who's on the Supreme Court, and what state do we live in? It's been years since I've thought about this. No, I'm not pregnant. But as you guys recall, and as a lot of people keep bringing up, Morty and I did accidentally create a giant incest baby, which the government did launch into space. And I'm not sure how to tell you this, but it is still alive, and I have been in contact with it. There were soldiers waiting for me outside school last month. They took me to the Pentagon, and briefed me. And from there, I was shuttled to a secret base on Mars. They had captured him, and wanted to see if he'd respond to me, instinctively, being his mother. And he sure did. But what they didn't expect was that I'd respond to him. I was supposed to help discipline him, so they could turn him into the ultimate w*apon. Instead, I trained him to love, to believe in himself, and finally, to escape. The government doesn't want anyone to know it happened, but it's only a matter of time before the story comes out. And when it does, all we're going to have is each other. And you guys are a couple, and Rick has Morty, but I'm the odd one out. So, I wanted to make sure we stuck together. But instead, I drove us apart, and Rick replaced me with an anime girl, so all I've got is myself and my giant, tortured, government-trained rogue incest monster baby out there in space somewhere. Oh, baby. What the f*ck. And then, you have to wonder, what else are they doing with our taxes? Wait. Summer, what did you just say? Morty, a lot. He replaced you with an anime girl? Big eyes? Plus signs for teeth? Ends sentences with weird sounds that don't fit? Yeah. That's going to be his whole crew now. And they're about to run their first test on the GoGoGoTron. Those people want to steal the robots. Th-they're gonna kill Rick. He's all alone. We-we-we've got to go save him. Right. Or... you know, f*ck him. - I'm good with that. - Yeah, f*ck him.

MORTY: After that, things pretty much went back to normal... some version of it, anyway. Rick said GoTrons were lame little kid bullshit, and we never talked about them again. SUMMER: Except all those gigantic space bugs were still runnin' loose, and there were no GoTrons left to fight them. MORTY: Yeah, millions die every day.

I was afraid I'd have to kill every Rick on the Citadel - to get what I needed. - You assh*le! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I'm sorry, Rick. That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth a screwdriver. You sellout Mortys kill me. I'd hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can't help it. You were bred for it. Wanna see? [WHIRRING] You already know Rogue Ricks used Mortys to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty Market. And I'm sure you don't know how far they've gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally occurring grandsons. But why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need. There aren't infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He's an infinite smear of one shitty old man. And he's attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. - Oh! Oh! - This is why we're with him. This is why we're alive. What the [BLEEP]? Rick, say this isn't true. - It isn't the whole truth. - BOTH: Liar! - It's complicated! - I'm not busy. Okay, Morty, remember when I said all I need was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doy. I'm basically Inspector Gadget. Uh-oh. It's okay. He's free to go. He's the Rickest Rick. We'll never see him again. Morty, when you came here for that serum, did you refill this gun? Yeah. Oh. Ooh! Holy [BLEEP]! I only know one man that ever hacked my portal gun, and it turned out it was evil you. Yay! He's all caught up. Wait. Hold it. Hold it. - Who... Who's that? - Time for Big Boy. Duck! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhh! Does he like it? It's a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think? Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! - Ohh! Ohhhhhh! - [GRUNTING] - Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhh! - [GRUNTS] Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhh! Ohhhhhh! RICK: Yoink! You can't outrun your past, Rick. Did you think my force field would be down the second time? I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue.

Nobody leave. Everybody stay. In uncertain times like these, I think it's important for me to say, eat shit, [BLEEP] you. The drug companies paid for me to say every word. I have millions of dollars, and I don't care if you live... oh, God! Oh, [BLEEP]! No! Aah! And I'd just like to say that prescription drugs are great, and you should buy them now.

Do you just lie to me about everything? Can't we just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We're back to simple adventures. It's not a new leaf until you tell me everything. Morty, we really don't have time for this. - The whole place is gonna blow. - No, I-I don't trust you. I-I don't want to do this anymore if I'm not gonna get straight answers from you. God damn it!

[WHIRRING] RICK: Morty, I'm not responsible for every [BLEEP]-up Rick out there. They literally all say that. They all have that excuse. It's part of their system. None of them have to be responsible. They're all victims of themselves. Oh, it's so hard to be a genius. Couldn't you just die? Well, what are you doing about it? Jack [BLEEP]. I'm leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around infinity. They separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he's the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib built around an infinite [BLEEP] baby. And I'm leaving it. That's what makes me evil... being sick of him. If you've ever been sick of him, you've been evil, too. Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you? There you go, kid. Now you're Evil Morty, too.

52,6,3,Bethic Twinstinct,"Oh, my God, I cannot f*cking believe this! Here we f*cking go! Oh! Jeez! Pardon the interruption. We are once again in the federal clear. Rick, what the hell?! A-Are you a Turkey Dracula now? Morty, is that a Pooplickian GamePod? Actually it's the GamePod XL. They say it's the most realistic video game console ever. - I never got you that. - Space Mom did. She's in for the holiday weekend, remember? Shit, in that case, let's go, let's get out of here... I heard you smack the glass, Dad. If you bail, I'll disown you! Yeah, I'd say don't hop through a portal. But, oh, wait, you can't. Look at it this way, Morty. Life is a subscription, and Thanksgiving is your family's yearly charge. Wow, Dad, good job. Rick, put some pants on. Today has so few rules. Yes, Patriarch. Ding ding ding! I'd like to make a toast. Today is a day for thanks. And for family. And for remembering all of those that have less. Okay, pick a scope. Pick a scope? Can we please have a normal Thanksgiving? Well, seems like all the ones I remember. Good point. Baby, you... It's a toast. - Sorry! - Sorry! Anyway, I'm thankful for my wife. Beth. The Beth that chose me. I'm so grateful to you, and I literally could not live without you. Aw! Aw! Aw! I really mean that. If something were to happen to you, or if you were to leave me, or be unfaithful, I would die. Mm! Uh... Literally. Probably by my own hand. Eww. Okay. I know how I'd do it. Our first blender has an extra long cord and it was manufactured before safety fuses, so I'd draw a warm bath... And blend some stuff. Good toast, honey. To thankfulness. To... A-America? To ending the toast? To ending the toast! Just to, uh, be clear, I was saying I'd kill myself. Jerry. God! We know! Advertise your product or brand here contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today Sorry Jerry got all husbandy. Yeah, do not miss that. So I was thinking we could set you up in Jerry's man cave? Oh, that's okay, I'll sleep in my car. It's got a TARDIS thing going on, bigger on the inside. Dad calls it hack, but my soaking tub begs to differ. Hmm, maybe I'll trade you. Ohh! Agh! My lower back. Oh, I got this. Ah, Jesus, that was great. Well, you're me. I find this is usually the biggest help. Mmm, oh, I just love... the Venusian stuff. It's cool, I get insecure trying to pronounce this crap, too, but I got just the thing for that. Here. Um... Okay, sh**t that asteroid. Now sh**t that one. Now sh**t me in the face. This game's trash. I didn't want to say anything, but this does seem lame. Yeah, I thought it was maybe 'cause we've shit so many real asteroids. L-Let's look at the menu. Oh! T-There's the realism setting. Oh, cool. Also stupid. The factory setting is 4? What do we want, 10? No, do 9. I'm kidding. Shut up, Summer. Yeah, shut up, Summer. Put 10. This is the same. It's worse. It's... Oh. Oh. I get it. Okay. It's... It's more real. The vast majority of space is empty. What? Who cares? T-Then what am I doing? Looks like you can record a video for your kid in case you die. Not a bad idea, you're gonna be in space for a while. May as well. Um, hey, son. Uh... If you're seeing this, I... starved to death while looking for an asteroid. Ugh. This is stupid. You guys are obviously just trying to convince yourselves it's cool because you feel lame about it. Summer you know nothing about gamer culture. Bro, tell your son you love the shit out of him. Oh, I'm gonna! Of course we both can't sleep at the same time. Yeah, we do share a shitty back. Turn around. At least let me... Yes, please. Oh, my God. Okay, I know we're not massage people but you need this. See, you act like this bad ass space cowboy, but I know you're just a scared little overachiever that keeps all her OCD right... Oh, my God! Yeah. By the way you better be taking notes... I'm next. It's my back, you dumb bitch. Nice. What? Well, I better get back to bed. Yep. Same. Oh, so now you're into highly realistic video games? Maybe I decided real life was too much right now, or maybe I'm not afraid to change my mind about stuff. Maybe mental flexibility is stronger than stubbornness. Nice manip', Sum-Sum. Okay, I-I'm in the alley behind the library. - Uptown or downtown? - Shit, there's one uptown, too? It's okay, stay there, I think I'm near the red line. Is this ""Street Fighter""? ""Street Fighter"" where you start at the beginning of each fighter's day and have to find each other to fight. It's very realistic. Not even guaranteed a fight will happen. That meter filling up is us forgetting what made us so mad. If anyone's interested in a higher level of realism, I'm booting up the OG... That's Original Game, called a jigsaw puzzle... In the den. Hey, gang! Me and my space self are gonna make a run to the Gloppy Drop System for ice cream. Any flavor requests? - Vanilla! - Vanilla! Why do you guys have to go all the way to deep space just for ice cream? Gloppy Dropulites have less taste buds than humans. Their ice cream is like a hospital bed. It's designed for you to do less so it does more. Okay, see ya in a bit. I'll get started sorting all the obvious sky pieces. Secret technique. - Oh, shit, there you are! - Oh, f*ck, it's on, bitch! I'm gonna eat your ass! You will die in the street like a dog! Stunning. Thank you. This is incredible. Eh. Just glad I had something in your size. How far is Gloppy Drop? And why do I always think I'm wearing a watch? I actually have a pint of Gloppy Drop on a little apartment orbiting Earth. So we have time. You have your own space station? We have our own space station. We're the same person. There's differences. Like, one of us has no idea who she really is. Wrong. But let's make a deal. Let's trust ourselves enough to stop wondering who we are when we're together. We get to say anything to each other. Things we'd never say to anyone else, even ourselves. What don't we say to ourselves? How about, ""Wow, my ass looks good in that space suit""? I mean it. I'm a good-looking woman. Well, that's nice of you to say. I also... find myself... quite attractive. We forgot the ice cream. I want you back in my guts like I'm one of your sick little fillies. Oh, God damn it, Morty! You can't just take my controller Yes, I can! It's mine! Ugh. Okay, Sum-Sum, gimme. Make your own controller, some of us need all the control we can get. Ugh, f*ck you! So why are you so suddenly into realistic video games? I already was. Yeah, but now you're into them the way I am. You mean, like staring at them in a numb trance? Uh-huh. Not judging, just noticing. Yeah, y-you tend to notice stuff a little before I do. But eventually you do notice. And now we can both not notice together, yes. - Oh, my god... - Beth! I thought you said you got ice cream? Yeah, I, uh... It must be in the, uh... Oh, the car! We left it in the car. Okay, good, because that would have been weird! I worry things might become more and more noticeable. Yeah, and if he kill himself, we're gonna have to get a new dad Jesus Christ, Summer! Hey, Dad. Um, hmm, what's this? Making a controller. This species of bionic space whale has carbon wiring, great for smooth game play. I'm not kill it, for the record. I'm just replacing its esophagus with a better one. For free. I-It should thank me. And it will, with its mind. These things are telepathic, Beth. They talk to you in dreams. Does your replicator thing make ice cream from the Gloppy Drop system? Why would you want replicated Gloppy Drop ice cream, poser? Crazy thing. I went with Space Beth to get some, and we had such a great time we forgot the ice cream! Crazy, right? That's a real question? M-Maybe? Come here, hold the pup down. You're talking about an infinite father. I've met myself out there infinite times. Infinite shit happens. Including, as you put it, forgetting the ice cream. You've... forgotten the ice cream? Drill me for details when I'm drunker. In the meantime, don't worry about what's crazy. You know, as the kids say, you do you. Oh, thanks. Thank you so much, Dad. One thing to keep in mind, though. It's not just your own ice cream you're forgetting. It's your family's. If you forget it too much, you start having to keep secrets. Oh, and you're against secrets? Against? Hell no. Secrets are great. For instance, I've had a pint of vanilla Gloppy Drop in my fridge this whole time. Take it. I'm just saying, lies pile up. Like credit card debt. You retain an advantage by staying liquid. Gotcha. Well... I'd call this a simple cash transaction. Fun and done. Favorite Culkin. - Kieran! - Kieran! Favorite song by Britney. ""Work Bitch""! ""Work Bitch""! Favorite hangover cure. Hair of the dog with a guilty Hair of the dog with a guilty pleasure like ""Humans Weekly."" pleasure like ""Us Weekly."" I told Dad. I mean, I didn't have to. He knew. I guess that's one reason you didn't have to tell him. What'd he say? We kind of talked in code, I think he said it's fine until it makes us feel indebted to our lessers. That sounds like Dad. Do we owe... the family an explanation? Do we have to spend our time together figuring out how to please others? I'm married. We both are, but I'm in our marriage. It's the defining difference between us. Well, there's no rule book that says you have to be. What's gonna happen? What is this? Are we in love... with our self? I mean, does that make us the most or the least healthy woman in the universe? Anybody ever tell you you're overly analytical? Which I do love. If that's what you need to call it. I don't need to call it anything. I would like to know... its shelf life. I might know a way to gather that data. Motel room! The Holodeck! I like yours better. Hmm... Uh... Beth! Uh, m-my Beth! Well, not ""my"" Beth, but... I finished! It's done! Kids, do you know where your moms are? Oh, you're busy with your GamePod. Don't worry about it, I'll find those two somewhere. No! No, Dad, um, come play video games with us! Okay, Dad, here's the infinite menu screen. Oh, I dunno. Here, here, I-I'll have the console choose a game! Um, maybe let's skip this one? Really? Why? Looks fun! Oh, okay, so we are a woman married to a man but having a sexual affair with another woman! Very spicy. Very spicy, Jer. G-Good job. Looks pretty single player, kids? Seriously, you two?! What the hell did you do in my Holodeck?! Holy shit, you... you did a full ""San Junipero"" in here? Oh, my God, Beth, there's masturbating and then there's masturbating. Ew, Dad stop, I'm sorry! You'd know, old man. Argh! Look, this isn't my business, and by all means, enjoy being sapphic horse girls together. But you suck at doing it secretly. We all know. Including Jerry?! No, Dad's so in the dark that he's enjoying a video game about being in an affair right now. If you guys are doing this, you got to tell him! Okay, little man, back off. Take it easy. They're right. Right about what, that we have to be twice as considerate and twice as repressed because some dick split us in two? This is the shit I left. This isn't. This is me. This is the me that doesn't tell you all to f*ck off. So allow me. f*ck off. She'll tell her husband what she wants when she feels like it. And you can deal with it or you can deal with me. But you should know I have all the Predator w*apon. Works for me. Fair enough. That's cool. I guess it's time for ice cream. Come on, kids, you're inhaling this stuff. Your Moms went to space. Did you even thank them for doing it? Thanks for... doing it, Moms. Very selfless of you. Eat your ice cream however you want. Nothing good lasts forever. Okay, come on, it's Thanksgiving. The least we can do is speak English. Jerry, I had sex with your wife. Or I'm your wife and had sex with the clone you sleep with. Your pick. We had sex. We loved it. Beth Sanchez sure is something, huh? I think I'll ask her to prom. Jerry, for your own sake, stay away from Beth Sanchez. Worst case, she says ""no."" No, Jerry. Worst case she says ""yes."" She's too much woman for you. Yeah, maybe she'd find your simple naiveté endearing, but she's intense. Sooner or later, she'd tear you apart. I'd be lucky to be torn apart by Beth Sanchez. - Aah! - What the f*ck?! Dad's a bug! Dad rolled into a bug! Oh, yeah. Sh... Forgot I installed that. Why does Jerry have a Pill Bug Protocol? It's an emotional defense system. I got drunk with Jerry one night and he said it's what he wanted most in the world. Don't blame me, I wanted tattoos. Anyway, he's in perfect health in there and he can unroll when he chooses to, but can also stay in metabolic hibernation pretty much indefinitely. It's a cool power to have, like if you have to fly coach or if Summer asks you what you thought of ""Wonder Woman 1984."" How do we undo it? Only he can. That's the point. It's total safety. Even I can't reverse it. If you try to pry him out and hit a nerve, he'll literally turn into a Shrek. In his own sad way, he's taken control. This is classic Jerry. He'd rather be a bug than have a conversation. Oh, have you heard the way you start conversations? You ladies discuss responsibility while I get stoned and play video games with your kids. f*ck! More forest! L-Look around! Try heading north. Oh, shit. Wait, what the f*ck? Um, maybe keep heading north? Ew, what the hell? Oh, God, w-what happens in the shadows? Jerry, sweetie, if you can hear me, please unroll. He doesn't want to. It's a little late to worry about what he wants. Jesus, Beth, don't fall for this. This isn't love, it's a tantrum. Yeah, but his tantrum is self-destructive. Yours is destructive. Maybe that's why I'm the one that loves him. He worries. He wants to do right. He's ashamed when he fails. Aren't those things you love about me? You want me to be like him? You want me to propose? Threaten to kill myself? No. I love you the way you are. And I did it forever in a video game. But in life, things go wrong. Things stop working. I-I like to fix those things, and when I can't, I'm pretty useless. Like my husband. I don't get it. You're the house wife and I'm the space lady, but you're the one that chewed me up and spit me out. I don't want to just forget about you. Me neither. It's a problem. But we know someone that owes us a solution. Oh, shit, we're out of the forest. We found a clearing. Go check it out! Go check out the clearing! Vampires?! Oh, come on! That's not realistic! Morty, it's obviously set in a world where vampires hunt in clearings. How did you... I'm working with the same information you are! Ow! No more screen time until your homework's done, Dad. - What did that mean? - We refuse to care. Damn. You really came of age this Thanksgiving. How old are we? We've had a million Thanksgivings. Can I explain how irrational this is? Asked the guy that cloned his daughter. Will I ever live that down? No.No. You guys are having me ""Eternal Sunshine"" all the ""Multiplicity"" p*rn scenes from your minds? Yep. Basically. Sounds right. Meanwhile, everyone around you... Your father, your cuckhold husband, your jaded children... Will just happily and silently bear the burden because it's more practical for them than the truth and you don't care because it won't be your problem? Solid repipe, Dad. It's like he has a lifetime of experience as a selfish ass. When this fails and the two of you fall in love again and you attack me for taking part in this, I'm gonna lie and say I tried to talk you out of it for hours. In truth, I don't care. Three, two... Oh, for God's sakes, all of you, grow up. - Jerry! You unrolled! - What the hell?! Ooh, plot twist, Deus Ex Husband a. Oh, don't lobotomize yourselves for my comfort. I may be a man, but I'm also a baby, and babies don't take responsibility for other people's suffering. I should never have said I'd kill myself if you left me. It's not true. All I'd do is pack my shit and cry while I look for a job on Starbucks Wi-Fi. And that's what I'm gonna do. So the two of you can get clone lesbian married by a robot and finger yourselves on the moon while laughing in Martian French about my weird little dick! Jerry, wait! Jerry, don't leave angry. Should I float out on a lotus leaf? I have to be twice as confident because my wife cheated on me with herself? It's not even cheating. Oh, you here to help? You suck. You don't even know which one is your real wife. If it's me, have you been cheating with a clone? I'm not the clone, but she has a point. Oh, what a provocative conversation it would've been great to have before the two of you... And I am counting two... Gave each other unfairly expert orgasms while mocking my weird little dick! Jerry, you're the only one who keeps saying ""weird"" and ""little."" Well, you've both seen it! And you've both seen each other, and now you want to tell me all about it, but it's a little late. Oh, my God. You're not mad that it was about you. You're mad that it wasn't. He wanted to permit our love. Okay, it's not ""Handmaid's Tale"" to loop in your husband. I agree, for the record. We made a mistake. Oh, because we should've noticed ourselves losing control and gone to Sex master Jerry and said, ""Oh, pretty please, Jerry, can I make out with myself?"" Yes, you may. Yeah, see. Not so hot when it's aboveboard, home-wreckers. Oh, so we won't enjoy this? Well, hold on, hold on, this is weird. Weird and permitted. Wait, you like this? Who cares what he likes. I do. I might like it. And if she likes it, I permit it. You little pervert. You like a little pervert. I like humiliating a little pervert. I approve. Carry on. I'm freaked out by how hot this is. Am I permitted to do this? Until further notice. I love it. Then it's permitted from now on. Oh, because you like whatever she likes. Because you're a worm. I will allow that assessment. - Pass the salt? - I don't care what you allow. - Damn it! - What do you allow? I allow this. Well, then it's required. I approve the requirement. You get over there. Good idea. Oh, wow. Okay. Uh, Honey? I'm fine if you are. You're never fine, shut up. Okay, but... Whoa! Okay. This is not how I pictured this, but... I have zero complaints so far. Because I know what you want. I do not disagree with that. Can I make a pitch? What if we... Are you serious? Hey, is... is this making fun of me? Well, is that bad? I'll allow it. Jesus Christ, you need to fix the portal gun, Rick! Morty, you asking makes me want to do it less. Okay, uh, Thanksgiving! L-L-Let's talk about Thanksgiving! Who's thankful for what? Go, Summer, y-you first. Um, I guess I'm thankful, for like, water? Perfect! Wonderful! Morty, w-what about you? f*ck Are you f*cking kidding me? Why? Why? Discovery Channel! Discovery Channel, why?! Okay. Just eat your food. Ea-Ea... Everyone eat the food. Sorry, I'm... Is this? Ooh! Well, bye, kids! I'll keep an eye out for my grand kid in space. Your what? Oh, right. ""Naruto."" Thanks for visiting, Space Beth. Well, seems like we all learned a little lesson this weekend! At least, I know I did. Me, too, Jerry. Me, too. Hello there, Jerry! How can I help you today? Howdy! Yeah, just, uh... Just here to hang! Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. You can't come here by yourself. Why not? It's just me in there! Well, not that this is something you'd do, but sometimes we have Jerries come here and try to touch other Jerries. Oh, no, that's... That's not good. Uh, well, see you later! - Okay. - Thank you.

I happen to dabble in multiversal travel, and I could probably zap you guys to an alternate Earth.

Dinosaurs are not secretly evil, and they're not out to cause anybody trouble, but it turns out trouble has a way of following them. Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's showtime. Literally every planet with dinosaurs on it is eventually smashed by a huge space rock that takes out them and most existing life. What? That can't be true. It's all right to be frustrated. Let me explain. Why would kill meteors follow dinosaurs? As these reptiles evolved to higher and higher levels of loving vegan godhood, another life-form devolved into an equally selfless, hate-filled species of barely sentient rocks.

Where's my soup? - [COUGHS] - RICK: Previous f*ck' Leon. Why is that prick here? No more a prick than you, friend. Meta characters erode reality. But all characters are meta, Rick. All of us are nourished and consumed by chaos, like newborns at the breast of a meth addict - in a lifeboat filled with forks. - I know what you have to do, Rick. Scrub Campbell's browser history? Just trust Previous Leon. Could you previously us a way home? Uh, well, I'll sure enjoy trying. Yeah, I bet you would. Rick can't change, Morty. Change is what you might call his Kryptonite. Except instead of being super, he's, you know, kind of a p*ssy. Let's do it. Previously, on Rick... - [SQUELCHING] - MORTY: Get him off! Get him off! - [CERAMIC BREAKS] - Oh, boy. - He almost kill you! - Okay, well, I feel bad, I kind of pressured you into trying that. - You called me a p*ssy. - I said I feel bad! This is a map to a region rich in narrative ore. I wish you the best of luck. Faster, Morty! I'd help, but I can't blister my inventing hands. - How long will it take? - Years. You can live in my wood shed. - Just don't open the door after dark. - Why not? Get out here, you Communist Jews! - Dude. Maybe I'm not an alcoholic. - I know, right? You f*cking ""Back to the Future"" rip-offs! - It's ready. - Rick, I should stay. - Why? - I'm pregnant. - What are you doing? - It wasn't him, Rick! - Then who?! - Me! I never left. But you had to think all this happened to make that. And I can get this through the titles? If you hang on tight. What about my beard and unborn child? Let them go. - Thank you, Leon. - When you get home, Rick, do some classic adventures. - Like season one... - I'm so sick of that f*cking note. What the f*ck does it even mean? Ohh! Now, one last time. - What's my motivation? - Motivation. This machine will siphon it from everyone in the universe. Perfect. Greenlit. Launch it. [GRUNTING] Oh, I think it's working! Yes, I can feel it! Something I did is actually affecting someone! ♪ ♪ I don't want to work anymore. I do, but only as an excuse to not practice guitar. ♪ ♪ Why don't we just write any number down on the score sheet? Oh, why even do that? [TELEPHONE RINGS] ♪ ♪ - _ - Wait, you have to register? Yes! I can feel it! I'm so motivated! I want... a lot! [PORTAL OPENS] - Story time's over. - Ha! Hardly your decision. Did you seriously double down on motivation as your motivation? - It's a good idea! - There's no such thing! There's joyful and there's joyless, and we've had our fill of one. Morty, make that sweaty writer stop working while I kill off his character. I have never been more driven to destroy someone. Yeah, well, I'm driven to lower my blood sugar, but guess who's getting tacos after he kicks your ass? So you're jacked. Who cares? - [CHUCKLES] Cum gutters. - I don't like that phrase. I don't take notes. [BOTH ROARING] You can't beat me, Rick. I have one million times your motivation! So do those guys with the cellphone kiosks at the mall. [BOTH GRUNTING] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [SQUEAKING] The hair is wrong. Like you'd be picky about licensing. Actually, I would. I happen to believe that... [GROANS] [GRUNTS, LAUGHS] - You can do that? - You got to want it. Come on, just stop. I-I don't want to fight you. Kid, I'm a writer that wrote something successful. So if you want me to give it up, you're gonna need a black belt - or a big pair of tits. - Yeah, well, I don't have those. CAMPBELL: In the mythical sense, I have both. Joseph Campbell? Yeah, nice try. He died in the ' s. Only you can see and hear me, Morty. - Just repeat what I tell you. - Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] Sir, you're only proud of your creation's success because you want to be creative, but creation doesn't happen through gimmicks, technology, and distribution. It doesn't even happen through work. Creativity is frankly adjacent to mental illness and overlaps with it substantially. A lot of talented people kill themselves and all of them are miserable. The real gift is to be ungifted, and from what I saw in your Green Arrow spec script, that's the gift you were given. You couldn't have seen that. I'm Joseph Campbell. I saw it. - The villain was a placeholder. - I said I saw it, Jan. I didn't say I could get past page five. Y-Your villains aren't the problem. The problem is, when you write, you're a villain. If you want to be a hero, just stop. [SNIFFLES, SOBS] You know what? Maybe I will register. Say it! Tell me I'm the new Mr. Nimbus! Oh, looks like your writer took a hiatus. Oh, f*ck. You're less motivated to fight now, so this is literally punching down, but you've got it coming. [GROANING] Please, let me live. I promise to be cooler. I'll be less inside baseball. Maybe I change my name? Ow! You failed me. No, I failed you. [COUGHS] All good things must come to an end. All bad things too, though, so don't flatter yourself. Jan, Joseph Campbell says you have to be the one to put him down. Wait, wait, wait, Joseph Campbell also says you have to use this brand-new limited edition Rick plush, available only on rick-plush.biz. - Supplies are limited. Act now. - He did? [SQUEAKING, MUFFLED GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] Shhh. [BREATHES HEAVILY] Jesus, that's the last time I buy a toy from a Rick. Ooh, the plushies are obviously well made. Thanks for getting us back alive, Rick. Well, I am a master of both worlds, Morty. Joseph Campbell told me to stop writing. Because it should be effortless. And when it happens organically, that's when it's meant to be. You know, like, um, like me. I'm a writer, here's a pencil. Writers use pencils. Okay, so, like, what if, like, a pencil used me? Like, um... okay! Yeah! Okay, so it's like a magic pencil that writes the writer's life... holy shit, it's a movie about a writer! I am back! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm Tag-Man! I-I-I-I live in the tag! I-I-I am the tag! I'm Tag-Man! Tag... Tag of the episode... man! ""Did you get any of that?"" When the... yeah, when an episode's over, look out, because, yaaaah, here comes Tag-Man! And I'm... I'm crazy! Tag-Man! Yeah! I'm... I'mma tag your ass! Tag that ass. Tag-Ass-Man! I'm an Ass-Man now! I'm a... I'm a Tag-Man! Here's what you get. Here's your tag! Yeah, you want some more? You want... you want some more tag, you sick piece of shit?! I'm... because I'm Tag-Man! I miss my wife. Too bad. This is it! Tag-Man, yeah! [INDISTINCT TALKING] Did you get any of that?"
