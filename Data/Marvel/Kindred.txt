He first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #31 (December [[1965 in comics|1965]]), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].\n\nHarry is the best friend of [[Peter Parker]] (Spider-Man&#39;s alter ego) and [[Flash Thompson]], one of the ex-boyfriends of [[Mary Jane Watson]], the son of [[Norman Osborn]], the husband of [[Liz Allan]] and the father of [[Normie Osborn|Normie]] and Stanley Osborn. He is the second character to assume the &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Green Goblin]]&#39;&#39;&#39; alias while one of his clones was amongst the many users of the [[Iron Patriot]] armor as the superhero &#39;&#39;&#39;American Son&#39;&#39;&#39;. He is also the creator of [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah Stacy]] who are both later to be operating as his [[demon]]ic [[revenant]] &#39;&#39;&#39;Kindred&#39;&#39;&#39;. \n\nThe character has appeared in many adaptations of &#39;&#39;Spider-Man&#39;&#39; outside of the comic books, including various cartoons and video games. [[James Franco]] portrayed the [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|character]] in [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|Sam Raimi&#39;s &#39;&#39;Spider-Man&#39;&#39; film trilogy]] (2002\u20142007), and [[Dane DeHaan]] portrays the character in &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]&#39;&#39; (2014).\n\n==Publication history==\nHarry Osborn first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #31 (December 1965),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 31|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= This monumental issue saw the first appearances of Peter&#39;s upcoming love interest Gwen Stacy, prospective best friend, Harry Osborn, and even the future super villain known as the Jackal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].\n\nIn &#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #122 (July 1973), Harry&#39;s father, [[Norman Osborn|Norman]], is killed off, and a subplot leading to Harry inheriting his father&#39;s identity as the [[Green Goblin]] is introduced. This subplot culminates in &#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #136 (September 1974). Writer [[Gerry Conway]] said that the idea of Harry Osborn becoming the Green Goblin stemmed in part from a desire to deal with the consequences of the psychedelic drugs Harry began using in &#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #96 (May 1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway said that he had had experience with such drugs himself, and that \&quot;with psychedelic drugs, hallucinogens, if they&#39;ve been misused, there is a potential for additional hallucinogenic experiences that are completely beyond your control or volition. I could imagine Harry getting hit by something like that, in the fragile emotional state following the death of his father, and losing touch with reality, as a result. Besides, I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept forever, so it all came together\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 14|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHarry dies in &#39;&#39;[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #200 (May 1993). Artist [[Sal Buscema]] said that drawing the final two pages of this issue was a deeply emotional experience for him due to how long he had drawn the character, and felt it was appropriate that writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] chose not to add any dialogue to those pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aushenker|first=Michael|date=October 2010 |title=Not Amazing, but Spectacular|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=44|page=60 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSeveral years later, the Spider-Man writers made plans to reveal that the mysterious villain Gaunt was Harry Osborn, who was still alive and had orchestrated the entire \&quot;[[Clone Saga]]\&quot;, but an editorial edict prevented this from coming to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veronese|first=Keith|date=October 2010 |title=Spider-Man: The Beginnings of the Clone Saga|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=44|pages=69\u201377 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harry was eventually revived in &#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #545 (December 2007). He received an entry in the &#39;&#39;[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] Update &#39;89&#39;&#39; #5.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHarry is the only son of [[Norman Osborn]] and [[Emily Osborn|Emily Lyman]]. The circumstances of Harry&#39;s birth weakens Emily, and she dies after a long illness. Heartbroken, Norman becomes a cold and unloving father; Norman either contemptuously dismisses Harry or lashes out at him in fury.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual&#39;&#39; #14. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Harry spends much of his life trying desperately to earn his father&#39;s approval. Unbeknownst to him, however, Norman had traded his son&#39;s soul to the demon Mephisto in exchange for wealth and power, and Harry would be cursed for the rest of his life while Norman forgot the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 5 #72. Marvel Comics.|year=2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Harry enrolls in Empire State University. Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon becomes one of the most popular as well, despite his aloof manner. He has a [[clique]] of rich, popular students around him; one of these is the lovely [[Gwen Stacy]]. Gwen is intrigued by a new student: bookish, studious and painfully-shy Peter Parker. Harry takes a dislike to Parker; he resents the attention Gwen pays to Peter, and he assumes that Peter&#39;s standoffishness is snobbery. After confronting Parker, Harry realizes that Peter is merely shy and is also worried about his ailing aunt [[Aunt May|May Parker]]. Despite this rocky start, Harry and Peter became friends, eventually sharing an apartment.\n\nHarry does not realize that his best friend is the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], nor that his father became the [[supervillain]] Green Goblin in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum. Moreover, before he became friends with Harry, Spider-Man was unmasked and captured by Green Goblin.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #39 (August 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent battle, an electric shock removed all memory of being Green Goblin from Norman&#39;s mind. Spider-Man then hid all evidence of Norman&#39;s double identity, to keep Harry from being hurt by the revelation.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #40 (September 1966). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, Norman&#39;s Green Goblin persona resurfaces from time to time. These are difficult times for Harry, as his father&#39;s periodic episodes are unexplainable. He had experimented with drugs in his teens; but he escalates his usage, as well as trying ever-harder substances. This affects his mental stability and his relationships with his friends. Spider-Man uses this to his advantage during one battle with Green Goblin; he is able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son&#39;s emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental drug overdose. The sight shocks Norman so much that it brings him back to sanity.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #98 (July 1971). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Green Goblin===\n[[File:Amazingspider136.jpg|thumb|upright|Harry Osborn as the new Green Goblin, battling Spider-Man on the cover of &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #136 by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]\nHarry is dumped by [[Mary Jane Watson]] due to being fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. Disconsolate, Harry turns to drugs and overdoses on amphetamines. He recovers at home instead of at a hospital, as Norman wanted to keep the matter quiet, and a doctor diagnoses him with schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Amazing Spider-Man #121. Marvel Comics.|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tragedy, compounded by imminent bankruptcy, drives Norman over the edge. The elder Osborn kidnaps Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then throws her off the [[George Washington Bridge]] (or [[Brooklyn Bridge]]). In a vicious battle with Spider-Man, the Green Goblin accidentally impales himself on his own [[goblin glider]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #121-122 (June\u2013July 1973). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Osborn secretly witnesses this. Wanting to protect his father&#39;s identity, he strips Norman Osborn&#39;s body of the Green Goblin costume. Blaming Spider-Man for his father&#39;s \&quot;murder\&quot;, Harry, angry and mentally unbalanced, swears vengeance. Having inherited his father&#39;s company, Harry manages to get the business back in shape. One day, to his shock, he finds a Spider-Man costume in Peter Parker&#39;s apartment and realizes that his best friend is the man he blames for his father&#39;s death. Using his father&#39;s old equipment, Harry confronts Peter as the second Green Goblin.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #136. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nNot wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoids fighting his old friend. After Spider-Man is able to thwart Harry&#39;s initial attempt on his life, Harry is knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There, he raves that he is the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but is dismissed as a lunatic.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #137. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He is put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. [[Bart Hamilton]] to extract the Green Goblin secrets from Harry through [[hypnosis]], and buries the knowledge deep within Harry&#39;s mind. Hamilton then raids one of Harry&#39;s hideouts and becomes the third [[Green Goblin]]. Meanwhile, Harry is released and considered cured. He sustains a concussion that makes him forget his knowledge of Spider-Man&#39;s identity and he and Peter rekindle their friendship.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nFor a while, Harry&#39;s life seems back on track; his company begins turning profits once more, and he develops a romance with [[Liz Allan]] after they meet at the wedding of [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]. Not long after the two are married, and eventually they have their son [[Normie Osborn]] named in memory of the boy&#39;s grandfather. Harry also gives his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane Watson. However, Harry starts regaining his memories when he is blackmailed by the original [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]] (Roderick Kingsley) with a package which contains evidence that his father was the original Green Goblin. When Hobgoblin learns he had raided all of Norman&#39;s hideouts, he leaves Harry alone, knowing he had nothing more to offer him. Later, Harry is forced to act as Green Goblin a few times, once to defeat the second [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] (Jason Macendale). This Hobgoblin is seeking the Goblin Formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength; Harry is able to defeat him by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto Hobgoblin. Harry even wonders if he could use the Green Goblin persona for a career as a superhero, but Peter convinces him that Green Goblin had too much baggage for such a role. Harry buries the Green Goblin menace within his mind once more and focuses on his business and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Web of Spider-Man #67. Marvel|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Death===\nThis tranquility is shattered when the aftereffects of the \&quot;[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]\&quot; crisis sunder the barrier between Harry&#39;s conscious and [[subconscious]] minds. Once again, he remembers being Green Goblin\u2014and his hatred of Spider-Man. Harry has now convinced himself that Peter Parker resents the Osborns&#39; \&quot;stable family life\&quot; due to never having been wanted by his own parents or guardians, when in fact it was the complete opposite. He uses Peter&#39;s trust in him to capture him, and subjects him to hallucinogenic gases to psychologically torment him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #180-181. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He finds himself unsatisfied with this revenge, however, and decides to kill Spider-Man. However, given the opportunity he proves unwilling to kill his best friend.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #182-183. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHarry investigates his father&#39;s old hideouts and notes, and finally uncovers and ingests the formula for the original Green Goblin&#39;s superhuman strength. He then kidnaps his wife, son, and brother-in-law [[Molten Man|Mark Raxton]], terrorizing them in an old family mansion. Raxton manages to signal their location to Spider-Man who defeats the Green Goblin and turns him in to the police.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #189. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Spider-Man pushes for Harry to get psychiatric treatment from Dr. [[Ashley Kafka]], but he is ultimately transferred to [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|the Vault]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #190. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the state is unable to put together a sufficient case against Harry, and after just a few weeks in prison, he is released.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #199. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHarry discovers that his father developed an advanced version of the Goblin Formula, but was unable to test it before his final battle with Spider-Man. After testing it, he ingests the new formula. When he spies Spider-Man investigating his townhouse, Harry loses his temper and attacks him as the Green Goblin. He injects Peter with a drug that leaves him immobile and, in a fit of depression, activates timed explosives that he had planted throughout the townhouse, planning to kill both himself and Peter. However, when he realizes that Mary Jane and his son Normie are also in the townhouse, he is shocked back to his normal self. Harry rescues Mary Jane, Normie, and Peter before he collapses. He belatedly realizes that he did not test the new formula diligently enough, and that it is, in fact, lethal before he dies holding Peter&#39;s hand.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Post-mortem===\nSometime before his death, Harry created a computer system with copies of his and Norman Osborn&#39;s minds programmed into it; after Harry&#39;s death, the computer system activates and abducts Normie Osborn with the intent of subjecting him to the Green Goblin Serum (the same one that had caused Harry&#39;s death) to make into the newest Green Goblin. This computer facsimile of Harry and its robotic drones (which resemble female versions of Green Goblin) were all destroyed by Spider-Man and the [[Molten Man]] who manage to save Normie from it.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil&#39;&#39;. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harry had one last trick up his sleeve. Sometime before his final confrontation with Spider-Man, Harry had employed the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to construct [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Peter&#39;s parents to play with his emotions. The plot ends with both constructs revealed as fakes when both \&quot;die\&quot;, shattering Peter&#39;s mind. After nearly killing the Chameleon, Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter, demonstrating that Harry was as manipulative and cruel as his father when gripped by insanity. Peter goes temporarily insane from the shock, even briefly rejecting his identity until the return of his clone [[Ben Reilly]] snaps him back to reality.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #389&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome time later Spider-Man encountered another digital version of Harry&#39;s mind, this one a hologram created by a group of rebel Scriers. This group had reconstructed Harry from all available information about him in the hope of using him to manipulate Normie, who they wished to use as a weapon against his grandfather. This Harry, possessing all the memories of the original, refuses to entertain the idea of his son becoming a killer, and assists Spider-Man in defeating the leader of the group. He then explains to Normie that Spider-Man is not an enemy and thanks Peter for all his help over the years. As the hologram disappears the badly injured Scrier grabs Normie with the intent of killing him, but someone - implied to be Harry - grabs the Scrier from out of the darkness and breaks his neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2000, Marvel Comics|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;Return from the grave&#39;===\nAfter [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]&#39;s manipulations of the timeline, details of Harry&#39;s death are seemingly retconned as being faked by [[Mysterio]] and his father who spirits his son away to Europe where he is held prisoner in several \&quot;rehab\&quot; clinics and believes that his son had relapsed into drug addiction, and this, in turn, led to his brief return to wearing the Green Goblin costume.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #581. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Mephisto&#39;s alterations, Harry&#39;s body was exhumed and tested, indicating he was dead.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil&#39;&#39; #1 (June 1996). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is explained to have been a \&quot;genetic duplicate\&quot; provided by Mysterio to fool anyone who investigated later, indicating he was alive all along and Peter simply did not know.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #581&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt some point, Harry is released from rehab and reunites with his friends. However, because Peter recruited [[Dr. Strange]], [[Mr. Fantastic]], and [[Iron Man]] to help him wipe out all evidence and memory of Spider-Man&#39;s secret identity (save from Mary Jane), Harry recalls his actions as the second Green Goblin but no longer remembers that Peter Parker is the web-slinger. His marriage to Liz Allan disintegrates and the two divorce. Harry engages in a string of relationships, several of which result in Harry marrying and divorcing in rapid fashion. He is in a relationship with Lily Hollister. Harry tries to help Lily&#39;s father in the latter&#39;s bid for Mayor of New York by funding her father&#39;s campaign with his dwindling finances.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #545&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHarry is also one of the leading suspects for the secret identity of a new Goblin. In the \&quot;[[New Ways to Die]]\&quot; story arc, [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]] battles Norman Osborn and is infuriated when Norman states that all he cares about is killing Spider-Man. Norman dons the Green Goblin costume and mentions that Harry has been in the Green Goblin&#39;s lair. Norman calls Harry, who realizes from Norman&#39;s distorted voice that Norman is wearing the Green Goblin suit. This horrifies and disgusts Harry, who vows to stop his father. Harry angrily confronts his father, who wants Harry to follow his legacy and become a greater man. The confused Harry is saved by Spider-Man. Spider-Man, who wants to beat Norman senseless, stops when he sees an area for human testing. Harry is claimed to be the one responsible for the atrocious acts, although he attempts to plead innocence. Harry later states that he wants to talk to Peter, who moments earlier was kissed by Lily, and is seen leaving with a mysterious canister labelled \&quot;Prometheus X-90\&quot;.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nPrometheus X-90, it is revealed later, was developed as a successful cure for Mark Raxton&#39;s condition as Molten Man. The only human test subject was Charlie Weiderman, the short-lived second Molten Man, and the only person on whom the serum could be tested. After the cure is administered, Liz finally forgives Harry and gives him back the wedding ring, which she originally claimed she lost.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #582.

She begins giving him a hard time about whining so much about his father. Harry thinks her behavior is because she is sick. She continues to tell him she uncovered one of Norman&#39;s secret rooms described in the journal. This explains why she kissed Peter after the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] attacked; he almost found the secret trigger to open the room. When she first entered the room, she found the Green Goblin&#39;s equipment and some experiments. Knocking over some chemicals, she absorbed them and is now able to transform at will. She explains that she discovered Menace&#39;s attacks against her father gives him more public support. She also tells him that she accepts his marriage proposal. After their talk, Harry enters one of his father&#39;s weapons caches, takes a glider (filled with bombs and winged bombs), a pair of Goblin gloves, a sword, and a dart gun containing an unknown chemical.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #586.

Harry tries to stop himself during a battle with Spider-Man, but Shaw takes over and is wounded by S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #74&lt;/ref&gt; He is once again used by S.H.I.E.L.D. to attract his father,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #115&lt;/ref&gt; but the two end up doing battle, which leaves Harry dead. Peter later makes a speech that honors his friend.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #117&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually revealed that the OZ formula gives Norman and Spider-Man immortality, making it possible that Harry is still alive somewhere.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man #6&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Zombies: Return]]&#39;&#39; #1, Zombie Spider-Man is taken to an alternate reality where it is the past and Peter is still in college, Harry and Gwen are alive, etc. Harry is shown hanging out (with a mustache) with Peter, MJ and Gwen. However, he is later shown being eaten by a zombified [[Sinister Six]], along with his friends.\n\n===Spider-Man: Clone Saga===\nIn the simplified re-telling of the [[Clone Saga]], Harry is revealed as the mastermind behind Peter and Ben Reilly&#39;s troubles throughout the story. Having secretly survived his final battle with Spider-Man, and still unhinged due to the side-effects of the Goblin formula, Harry carries out a vengeful campaign against the Spider-Men with the aid of [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]. His plans also include the cloning of his deceased father, who apparently was killed by his Goblin Glider in this reality. Harry soon heads out to attack Ben Reilly in the guise of the Green Goblin. His plans are thwarted when Kaine switches sides. The Norman clone, who is not insane due to not being exposed to the Goblin Formula, tries to convince Harry to stop before sacrificing himself by jumping in front of the moving Goblin Glider (akin to Ben Reilly&#39;s death in the main universe). The series concludes with an irate Harry swearing vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man: Clone Saga&#39;&#39; #4-6&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Spider-Man: Life Story===\n&#39;&#39;Spider-Man: Life Story&#39;&#39; features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Peter has Norman arrested to prevent the Green Goblin from hurting anyone, leaving Harry in charge of Oscorp. In 1977, Harry is engaged to Mary Jane, but shows signs of a drug addiction brought upon by the stress of his position and his father&#39;s imprisonment. Norman convinces Harry to attack Miles Warren as the &#39;&#39;&#39;Black Goblin&#39;&#39;&#39; to retrieve his clone, but Harry discovers that Miles also cloned Peter and Gwen Stacy in the process. Harry realizes Norman cloned Peter because Norman still considered Peter the more worthy heir and attacks him. After Peter convinces Harry of his father&#39;s manipulations, Harry blows up the facility, killing all the clones except Peter&#39;s. However, Miles reveals that the \&quot;Gwen\&quot; Peter was with was actually her clone while the real Gwen died in the explosion, leaving Harry wracked with guilt. By one year later, he has broken up with Mary Jane and left her with a significant amount of money before disappearing. In 1995, Otto Octavius breaks into Oscorp and threatens Harry into letting him use equipment to study Peter and his clone, Ben, to find a way to clone himself. Chaos erupts after he discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben is the original. When Otto attempts to kill them both, Harry sacrifices himself to save Peter. As he dies in Peter&#39;s arms, he apologizes for being weak with Otto and his father, though Peter reassures him that he was not. It is later revealed that Otto was allowed to enter Oscorp by an elderly Norman, who has a heart attack and dies after learning of Harry&#39;s death.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man: Life Story&#39;&#39; #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Spider-Gwen===\nIn this version, Harry Osborn is a social outcast at high school who is constantly bullied due to a rumor that he tried to burn his old prep school down; Flash Thompson notably bullies him and nicknames him the \&quot;Green Goblin\&quot;. Gwen Stacy and Peter befriend him out of pity, and Harry asks Gwen out to the prom, angering Peter. He witnesses Peter transform into the [[Lizard (comics)#Spider-Gwen|Lizard]], fight [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]] and die. At Peter&#39;s funeral, he feels guilty that he did not do anything to prevent Peter&#39;s death, and disappears from school for two years.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Gwen&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt; He returns one night tells Gwen that he joined the army and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after Peter&#39;s death and plans to avenge him by taking down Spider-Woman. During his fight with Spider-Woman, he takes the Lizard serum to overpower the heroine, but runs away after discovering Spider-Woman is Gwen. He then goes on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. and is pursued by ninjas belonging to [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]], [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Spider-Gwen|Wolverine]], and [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Spider-Gwen|Shadowcat]] before fully transforming into the Lizard. Figuring out that there is a connection with their powers and a mysterious substance given to her by [[Kingpin (Matt Murdock)|Matt Murdock]], Gwen manages to get the Lizard serum out of Harry&#39;s blood and combines it with the substance, which forms the [[Alternative versions of Venom#Spider-Gwen|Venom symbiote]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Gwen&#39;&#39; vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Spider-Geddon===\n*During the \&quot;[[Spider-Geddon]]\&quot; storyline, the Earth-44145 version of Harry Osborn arrives at Oscorp and makes his way through the building. The narration is in the form of a letter to Harry from Peter Parker on what is happening at Oscorp. As a six-armed [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Spider-Man (Norman Osborn) (Earth-44145)|Norman Osborn]] is informed of Harry moving through Oscorp and having been secretly armed, he is told that Harry is on the 15th floor near Mr. Warren&#39;s lab. Becoming Spider-Man and arriving where a warped [[Cosmic Cube]] is located, Norman confronts Harry who dons the Kobold armor. It was revealed during the fight that Norman killed Peter Parker as a badly-injured Harry fires a laser beam at the warped Cosmic Cube.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Edge of Spider-Verse&#39;&#39; #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n*During the return of the Inheritors, Spider-Gwen&#39;s device to travel through the multiverse got destroyed by Verna and then Gwen got stranded in an alternate universe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Geddon&#39;&#39; #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In this universe Peter Parker and this universe&#39;s Gwen Stacy got a job at Oscorp and Peter wanted to create a cure for cancer, after his Uncle Ben died from it. Peter was experimenting with spider venom to create the cure but one of the spiders bit Harry Osborn making Harry this universe&#39;s Spider-Man. Harry alongside Gwen Stacy as this universe&#39;s [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Spider-Geddon|Green Goblin]] started to fight crime together, until during a fight with the Sandman, both Harry and Gwen&#39;s father got killed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Geddon Ghost Spider&#39;&#39;. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Infinity Wars ===\nIn the new universe created by the folding of reality in &#39;&#39;[[Infinity Wars]]&#39;&#39;, Harry&#39;s father, Norman, is fused with [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russel]] and becomes [[Werewolf by Night#Other versions|Goblin by Night]]. This version of Harry is the best friend and partner of Peter Spector (a fusion of Peter Parker and [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]]), who operates as the vigilante [[Moon Knight#Infinity Wars|Arachknight]]. When Peter tries to kill Norman as revenge for Norman killing Peter&#39;s family, Harry intervenes and saves his father. After Ben and May were killed by Norman, Harry discovered his father was cursed into an uncontrollable Goblin, and caused him into killing both Peter&#39;s uncle and aunt against his will. While Harry is taking care of his father, Norman loses control and bites Harry, passing the curse to him.
