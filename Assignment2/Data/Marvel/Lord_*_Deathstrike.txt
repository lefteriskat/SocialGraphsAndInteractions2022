The Hellfire Club often comes into confrontation with the mutant superhero team, the [[X-Men]].  Although the Club appears to merely be an international social club for wealthy elites, its clandestine &#39;&#39;&#39;Inner Circle&#39;&#39;&#39; seeks to influence world events, in accordance with their own agenda.\n\nCreated by the &#39;&#39;[[Uncanny X-Men]]&#39;&#39; writer/artist duo of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], they were heavily influenced by a 1966 episode of the British television series &#39;&#39;[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]&#39;&#39; (\&quot;[[A Touch of Brimstone]]\&quot;).&lt;ref name=xcompanion2&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men Companion II&#39;&#39;. 1982. Fantagraphics Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The name \&quot;[[Hellfire Club]]\&quot; in fact has a historical precedent, having been a popular name for [[gentlemen&#39;s clubs]] in the 18th century. Additionally, the hierarchy of the Inner Circle is modeled on the pieces of a chess set, with Black and White sets of Kings, Queens, Bishops and Rooks.\n\nThe Hellfire Club and its Inner Circle were introduced in \&quot;[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\&quot;, attempting to subvert the X-Men&#39;s [[Jean Grey]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #129-135&lt;/ref&gt; This incarnation, composed most notably of Black King [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and White Queen [[Emma Frost]], would remain prominent for many years. After their initial confrontations, the Hellfire Club and the X-Men settled into an uneasy alliance.&lt;ref name=\&quot;uxm209\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;nm51\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #51&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually changed as endless power struggles perpetuated a series of upheavals within the Inner Circle. The club has appeared in two X-Men animated series (&#39;&#39;[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]&#39;&#39;), both times being renamed as simply The Inner Circle, due to the aversion of using the term \&quot;hellfire\&quot; in a children&#39;s cartoon. Members of the Hellfire Club appeared in 2011&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[X-Men: First Class]]&#39;&#39; as the main villains, led by Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, Azazel and Riptide. The Hellfire Club\u2019s Inner Circle also appear as the main antagonists of the [[The Gifted (season 2)|second]] season of the television series &#39;&#39;[[The Gifted (American TV series)|The Gifted]]&#39;&#39; led by a character named Reeva Payge played by [[Grace Byers]], and the [[Stepford Cuckoos|Frost sisters]] played by [[Skyler Samuels]].\n\n==Publication history==\nIn creating the Hellfire Club, &#39;&#39;[[Uncanny X-Men]]&#39;&#39; writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] drew heavily upon a 1966 episode of the British spy series &#39;&#39;[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]&#39;&#39; entitled \&quot;[[A Touch of Brimstone]]\&quot;.&lt;ref name=xcompanion2/&gt; In the episode, agents John Steed and Emma Peel attempt to infiltrate a secret society named after the [[Hellfire Club]] of the 18th century, whose members of the \&quot;Inner Circle\&quot; all wear period costumes. Emma Peel&#39;s guise as \&quot;the Queen of Sin\&quot;, dressed in a black leather corset, would be the model for the Club&#39;s Queens, her first name even borrowed for White Queen [[Emma Frost]]. The leader of the episode&#39;s club was played by actor [[Peter Wyngarde]], best known for his role as [[Jason King (TV series)|Jason King]], forming the basis for [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]]&#39;s new \&quot;Jason Wyngarde\&quot; identity.\n\nThe other members of Claremont and Byrne&#39;s Hellfire Club were similarly drawn from the names and faces of famous actors: [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] was based on actor [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]], [[Harry Leland]] on [[Orson Welles]] (who acted as Harry Lime in &#39;&#39;[[The Third Man]]&#39;&#39; and whose film &#39;&#39;[[Citizen Kane]]&#39;&#39; featured a reporter named Jed Leland), and [[Donald Pierce]] was based on [[Donald Sutherland]] (the surname referencing his [[Hawkeye Pierce]] character from &#39;&#39;[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]&#39;&#39;).&lt;ref name=xcompanion2/&gt;\n\nLater writers would further the references to &#39;&#39;The Avengers&#39;&#39;: Sir Patrick and Lady Diana, from the Philadelphia branch of the 1780s, are named after actors [[Patrick Macnee]] (John Steed) and [[Diana Rigg]] (Mrs. Emma Peel); conversely, the Black Queen of the London branch was revealed to be named Ms. Emma Steed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Excalibur&#39;&#39; #99&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Overview==\nThe Hellfire Club counts among its members the most famous, wealthy, and influential members of society. Membership is passed on to descendants, and can also be earned through wealth or influence. While many accept the invitation simply for the pleasures that the Club offers, others seek wealth and influence. In fact, the purpose of the Hellfire Club is to obtain and exert power through politics and economic influence instead of outward conquest and domination. Since its foundation, the Hellfire Club has been involved in wars and assassinations to further the agendas of the Club&#39;s most powerful members.\n\nThe Club has branches in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Paris]]; the various branches are all overseen by the Lord Imperial (a position long-held by Sir Gordon Phillips).&lt;ref name=\&quot;xxm3\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Treme X-Men&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to most members is the Club&#39;s Inner Circle. Originally known as the Council of the Chosen, this secret group formed around [[Edward Buckman|Edward \&quot;Ned\&quot; Buckman]], each member assuming the titles of the major chess pieces. As White King, Buckman financed [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]]&#39;s revived [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] program with the assistance of probationary member [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #100&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw, now Black Bishop, began securing allies within the Club, meeting [[Harry Leland]], [[Emma Frost]], and [[Donald Pierce]], as well as his loyal assistant, [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]].&lt;ref name=hellparents&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: The Hellfire Club&#39;&#39; #4&lt;/ref&gt; Buckman, no longer having a use for the dangerously-ambitious Shaw, ordered a Sentinel attack on Shaw and his allies, resulting in the death of Shaw&#39;s lover, [[Lourdes Chantel]]. That night, Shaw and Emma Frost purged the entire Council of the Chosen, remaking it as the Lords Cardinal and appointing themselves Black King and White Queen.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Classic X-Men #6-7\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Classic X-Men&#39;&#39; #6-7&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nShaw&#39;s Inner Circle soon turned their attentions to the [[X-Men]], kidnapping several of their number. [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], as Jason Wyngarde, was made a probationary member pending his subversion of the X-Men&#39;s [[Jean Grey]]. Jean Grey was in fact the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]], a god-like cosmic entity who became unstable after Mastermind&#39;s psychic manipulations, turning into the [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]]. The Hellfire Club had failed, and the X-Men had taken their toll: Phoenix had driven Mastermind insane, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] had crippled Donald Pierce and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] nearly killed Harry Leland and several guards.&lt;ref name=\&quot;uxm132-135\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #132-135&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDespite such setbacks, the Inner Circle continued to pursue its agenda. Shaw, using his connections to [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] to initiate [[Project Wideawake|Project: Wideawake]], secured a government contract for Shaw Industries to manufacture [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], profiting from the state of fear concerning the \&quot;mutant menace\&quot; despite secretly being a mutant himself. Frost meanwhile ran the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], a prestigious preparatory school affiliated with the Hellfire Club that secretly trained a team of young mutants, known as the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]]. The Inner Circle also underwent some personnel changes, notably the expulsion of Donald Pierce for conspiring against his mutant colleagues,&lt;ref name=\&quot;mgn4\&quot; /&gt; and the addition of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] as Black Queen.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #189&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAlthough the hierarchy of the Inner Circle goes through constant upheaval due to the competing egos and political motives of its members, it continues to exist in the same basic structure today.\n\nMagneto briefly took the title of Grey King after Sebastian Shaw was voted out of the Inner Circle,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #75&lt;/ref&gt; and with Emma Frost he began plotting against Black Queen Selene,{{issue|date=September 2014}} having planted Hellion Empath into Nova Roma via his relationship with New Mutant Magma prior to ousting Shaw.{{issue|date=September 2014}} However, when Magneto discovered the X-Man Rogue alive and well in the Savage Land (where Magneto was visiting),{{issue|date=September 2014}} Magneto abandoned the Hellfire Club and ultimately went into exile when he was rejected by Rogue when he murdered the Savage Land priestess Zaladane.{{issue|date=September 2014}} Meanwhile, Emma Frost attempted to force former Hellion Firestar to rejoin the Hellions but was rebuked by Firestar and her new teammates in the New Warriors.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Warriors&#39;&#39; #10&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDisjointed, Selene exploited the chaos to launch a pre-emptive strike to slaughter the Lord Cardinals with aid from a group of young mutant \&quot;Upstarts\&quot; who were loyal to Selene. Points for each kill were awarded by the [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]] and Magneto, Shaw, Pierce, and Frost were all targeted, before Selene herself was betrayed by Trevor Fritzroy and Gamemaster. During this time the Inner Circle of the London branch was working behind the American branch&#39;s back and was influencing [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the secret government agency &#39;&#39;Black Air&#39;&#39;. [[Captain Britain]] (Brian Braddock) held a position for a short term on Shinobi Shaw&#39;s advisement to investigate its activities as they had mutual objectives. [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] collected evidence of their crimes and the Inner Circle was either arrested or went into hiding.\n\nThe Upstarts&#39; uprising was quashed by Sebastian Shaw. He reinstated some of the old Inner Circle until he disbanded it due to his own invested interest in business pursuits. The Club still continued loosely partly due to Selene&#39;s influence, although it never had the same prestige as the original.\n\nSebastian Shaw again reformed a variation of the original Inner Circle with a nobler outlook posing as a force for good, which may have been a deception on his part. Tessa/Sage rejoined the Inner Circle to observe this and to assist [[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa]]&#39;s usurping the position of Lord Imperial which Shaw had claimed.\n\nThe Hellfire Club was next under the leadership of Roberto da Costa as the Lord Imperial aided by Sage. [[Sat-Yr-9]] (under the guise of Courtney Ross) as the new White Queen, aided by her assassin [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], her \&quot;Warrior White Princess\&quot;. As with many members in the past, both Sat-Yr-9 and Viper have their own personal agendas.\n\nFollowing [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Sunspot remains as Lord Imperial, while Shaw resumes his activities, though under Sunspot&#39;s close watch. While Sat-Yr-9&#39;s whereabouts remain unknown, Viper returns to [[Madripoor]] to oversee [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] operations&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Avengers&#39;&#39; #42&lt;/ref&gt; and Sage became a member of the short-lived [[New Excalibur]], only to end up as one of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].\n\nWhen the X-Men and many other powered or depowered mutants came to San Francisco, an offshoot of the Club, known as the Hellfire Cult, begins attacking mutants and \&quot;species traitors\&quot;. Officially, their leadership appears to be [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], but the real power behind the scenes is the mysterious Red Queen. Their activities draw the attention of the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; 500-502 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nKade Kilgore later took control of the Hellfire Club. Kilgore founded the Hellfire Academy where he recruited mutant outlaws as its faculty and started looking for students to attend this school.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Wolverine and the X-Men #20\&quot;/&gt; The Hellfire Academy serves as the direct opponent for the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wolverine and the X-Men&#39;&#39; #23&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Lord Imperial===\nThe &#39;&#39;&#39;Lord Imperial&#39;&#39;&#39; is not a member of the Inner Circle or any particular branch of the Hellfire Club; the Lord Imperial is the true leader of the Hellfire Club and oversees all branches of it. As such, only a few individuals have held the title. Sir Gordon Phillips, while unknown at the time, ruled as Lord Imperial for most of the club&#39;s modern history, holding the position from before the club&#39;s introduction&lt;ref name=\&quot;xxm3\&quot;/&gt; until his death: killed by Sabertooth on a cruise ship filled with humans infected with the [[Legacy Virus]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Uncanny X-Men #388\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #388&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Sir Gordon Phillips&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Elias Bogan]]&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa (Sunspot)]]&#39;&#39;&#39;\n\n===Inner Circle===\nThe constant intrigue, backstabbing, blackmailing and politicking that plague the Hellfire Club have resulted in many changes of the Inner Circle, as new players seek out membership in order to obtain influence, power and wealth. The following lists the membership of each incarnation of the Inner Circle and the title they held; in descending order of rank are Kings and Queens, followed by Bishops and Rooks.\n\n====The Council of the Chosen====\nThe original Inner Circle (existing prior to the club&#39;s introduction) consisted of:\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Edward Buckman|Edward \&quot;Ned\&quot; Buckman]]&#39;&#39;&#39;  - White King\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Paris Seville&#39;&#39;&#39; - White Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Bishop\n\nSebastian Shaw was instrumental in the Hellfire Club&#39;s funding of [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]]&#39;s resurrected [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] program, but having completed his purpose, White King Ned Buckman sought to eliminate the ambitious Black Bishop. After a Sentinel attack on Shaw&#39;s beach house resulted in the death of his lover, [[Lourdes Chantel]], Shaw and his ally [[Emma Frost]] purged the entire Council in one night and appointed themselves its Black King and White Queen.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Classic X-Men #6-7\&quot;/&gt;\n\n====The Lords Cardinal====\nShaw renamed The Council of the Chosen as The Lords Cardinal following his takeover of the New York branch, and appointed a number of allies to key positions. Frost began running the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]] at this time. [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]], also known as Mastermind, later became a probationary member pending his subversion of the X-Men&#39;s [[Jean Grey]] into the Club&#39;s Black Queen.\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black King\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Emma Frost]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - White Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Donald Pierce]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - White Bishop\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Harry Leland]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Bishop\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind)]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - A probationary member who was presumably intended for one of the two Rooks.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] (posing as [[Jean Grey]])&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sage (comics)|Tessa]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Shaw&#39;s personal aide.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Associate of the Hellfire Club.\n\nFollowing Mastermind&#39;s failed subversion of Jean Grey,&lt;ref name=\&quot;uxm132-135\&quot;/&gt; the title of Black Queen was once again empty. Donald Pierce reached the rank of White King but was later expelled for conspiring against his mutant colleagues.&lt;ref name=mgn4&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Graphic Novel&#39;&#39; #4&lt;/ref&gt; New members appointed during this period were:\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]:&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Queen&lt;ref name=\&quot;New Mutants vol. 1 #23\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #23&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Friedrich Von Roehm]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Rook&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #22&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Emmanuel da Costa&#39;&#39;&#39; - White Rook&lt;ref name=\&quot;New Mutants vol. 1 #23\&quot;/&gt;\n\nA truce between the Hellfire Club and the X-Men began after an encounter with [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] resulted in the deaths of Leland and von Roehm.&lt;ref name=\&quot;uxm209\&quot;/&gt; This truce soon grew into a formal alliance as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], as the leaders of the X-Men and Xavier&#39;s school respectively, took over the shared position of White King.&lt;ref name=\&quot;nm51\&quot;/&gt;\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - White King (with Magneto)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - White King, later Grey King\n\nStorm and the X-Men would later seemingly die, leaving Magneto alone to deal with the Inner Circle. After a protracted power struggle, Magneto turned Emma Frost and Selene against Shaw and expelled him from Inner Circle, assuming both mantles as the new Grey King.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #75&lt;/ref&gt; Magneto, while never formally resigning, would soon withdraw from the club, after relocating to Savage Land to deal with the threat of the villainess Zaladane.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #269&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Selene would turn against Frost and Magneto after learning that the two had sent Empath (one of Emma&#39;s students) to Selene&#39;s Amazon fortress Nova Roma in order to subvert Selene&#39;s granddaughter Magma. Selene would create \&quot;The Upstarts\&quot;, a group of young and wealthy mutants who replace the Hellfire Club. Organizing a \&quot;game\&quot; where whichever member killed the most Hellfire Club members would rule the group, Emma Frost&#39;s students in the Hellfire Club were slaughtered by Trevor Fitzroy and Emma herself put into a coma. Fitzroy also \&quot;killed\&quot; Donald Pierce and his Reavers. Magneto meanwhile, having relocated to Asteroid M, invited a young healer named Fabian Cortez and his group known as the Acolytes to stay with him. Cortez (whose power was to boost other mutants abilities) manipulated Magneto into declaring war upon the X-Men and ultimately hijacked control over a SHIELD orbital weapons platform, to blow up Asteroid M, seemingly killing Magneto. Sebastian Shaw would be \&quot;killed\&quot; by Shinobi Shaw, a young mutant who was fathered by Harry Leland but raised by Sebastian as his son.&lt;ref name=uxm281282&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #281-282, &#39;&#39;X-Men&#39;&#39; #1-3, &#39;&#39;X-Factor&#39;&#39; #67&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, Empath used his powers to manipulate all of Nova Roma (including Magma) into thinking they were kidnapped victims of Selene&#39;s, who had been manipulated due to her mind control powers, into thinking they were citizens of an ancient, long lost Roman settlement in South America.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Warriors&#39;&#39; #31&lt;/ref&gt; Selene however, would soon fall prey to her new allies own wrath as Trevor Fitzroy and Selene&#39;s ally, the Gamemaster, turned against her and allowed Gamemaster to take control over the Upstarts.\n\nWhite Rook Emmanuel da Costa was also killed around this period, though his death was unrelated to the agenda of the Upstarts. A group of immortal mutants known as the Externals, became aware of a prophecy that one of the New Mutants was destined to play a major role in the salvation of the planet. The prophecy referenced two New Mutants in particular, de Costa&#39;s son Sunspot and the New Mutant [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], one of which potentially possessed the secondary mutation of immortality and the destiny of savior of mutantkind.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Force&#39;&#39; #21-23&lt;/ref&gt; As Cable infiltrated the New Mutants under the notion that Cannonball was to be the immortal messiah, the External&#39;s leader Gideon sought to corrupt Sunspot, who was the messiah promised in the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Force&#39;&#39; #11-16, &#39;&#39;Avengers World&#39;&#39; #19-21&lt;/ref&gt; Already a family friend, Gideon had de Costa&#39;s secretary poison the White Rook in order to force his super-hero son to leave the New Mutants and take leadership of his family&#39;s company.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #98&lt;/ref&gt; When Cannonball survived a near fatal impaling (which Cable mistook as being the result of his being immortal), Gideon turned on Sunspot who was ultimately rescued by X-Force.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Force&#39;&#39; #15&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWith exception of de Costa; all of the Hellfire Club Lord Cardinals killed by the Upstarts, later recovered. Sebastian Shaw faked his death, as did Magneto. Donald Pierce was rebuilt by Stryfe along with the rest of the Reavers, while Emma Frost recovered from her coma and repented her evil ways.\n\n====Shinobi Shaw&#39;s Upstart Inner Circle====\nSelene had originally planned on creating a new Inner Circle with the help of the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]] - among them [[Shinobi Shaw]], son of Sebastian Shaw - but they betrayed and imprisoned her. Believing to have successfully assassinated his father,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Factor&#39;&#39; #67&lt;/ref&gt; Shinobi Shaw briefly took over the New York branch of the Club, seemingly with support from the [[Externals|External]] [[Candra (comics)|Candra]]. He offered membership in his Inner Circle to [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]],&lt;ref name=\&quot;hell29\&quot;/&gt; Storm,&lt;ref name=\&quot;X-Men vol. 2 Annual #3\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men&#39;&#39; Annual #3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] (also known as Roberto da Costa, son of former White Rook Emmanuel da Costa),&lt;ref name=\&quot;X-Force vol. 1 #62\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Force&#39;&#39; #62&lt;/ref&gt; but all declined.\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Shinobi Shaw]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black King\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Benedict Kine]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - White King\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Benazir Kaur&#39;&#39;&#39; - White Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Reeva Payge&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Candra (comics)|Candra]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Associate\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Cordelia Frost&#39;&#39;&#39; - Probationary member\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Ebon Knights&#39;&#39;&#39; - Shinobi Shaw&#39;s Black Guard\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Ivory Knights&#39;&#39;&#39; - Benedict Kine&#39;s White Guard\n\nThe titles of Payge and Kaur are not established. When Cordelia Frost (younger sister of Emma) applies for membership to the Inner Circle, Shinobi states that the title of White Queen is already taken.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Generation X&#39;&#39; Annual &#39;95&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nShinobi Shaw&#39;s actions as Black King were limited to failed attempts at extending his influence and monitoring the London branch of the Club.\n\n====The London Branch====\nThe Hellfire Club&#39;s London branch is introduced briefly operating parallel to Shinobi&#39;s Inner Circle.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Excalibur vol. 1 #96\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Excalibur&#39;&#39; #96&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of Black and White, the titles of the London Inner Circle are designated Black and Red.\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Emma Steed]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Queen&lt;ref name=london&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Atlas&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Margali Szardos]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Red Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Quentin Templeton&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black King&lt;ref name=london/&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Alan Wilson&#39;&#39;&#39; - Red King&lt;ref name=london/&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock (Captain Britain)]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Bishop\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Conrad Strathdee&#39;&#39;&#39; - Red Bishop&lt;ref name=london/&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Scribe (comics)|Jane Hampshire]] (possessed by [[Mountjoy (comics)|Mountjoy]])&#39;&#39;&#39; - Red Rook&lt;ref name=london/&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Rutledge&#39;&#39;&#39; - Servant\n\nCaptain Britain, having inherited club membership from his father, Sir James Braddock, was asked by Shinobi Shaw to infiltrate the London Inner Circle, as the branch&#39;s mysterious agenda surely ran counter to both their interests.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Excalibur vol. 1 #96\&quot;/&gt; The London Branch and their plans were soon brought to an end after a failed attempt to use a demon&#39;s essence to control the city.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Excalibur&#39;&#39; #99-100&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Queen and Red King were taken into police custody.\n\n====Shaw&#39;s Second Circle====\nSebastian Shaw, despite his apparent death, later re-emerged&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Force&#39;&#39; #48&lt;/ref&gt; and retook control of the Hellfire Club in attempt to restore its former power and glory. Selene, freed from her imprisonment by the Upstarts, took under her influence a resurrected [[Madelyne Pryor]] in her quest for revenge.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Man&#39;&#39; #7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Man&#39;&#39; #13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Man&#39;&#39; #16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw meanwhile attempted to ally with the [[Age of Apocalypse|AOA]]-exile [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]]. Meeting in New York, Shaw proposes a reformation of the Inner Circle with the following line-up:&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Man&#39;&#39; #20-22&lt;/ref&gt; At first operating in secret from outside the Hellfire Club (still under Shinobi Shaw&#39;s control), Sebastian&#39;s group soon reasserted control over the organization.&lt;ref name=\&quot;X-Man #28\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Man&#39;&#39; #28&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black King\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Trevor Fitzroy]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - White Rook\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Madelyne Pryor]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Red Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Donald Pierce]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Applicant for White Bishop\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sage (comics)|Tessa]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Shaw&#39;s personal aide\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Ella&#39;&#39;&#39; - Selene&#39;s personal servant\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Associate\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Miss Hoo&#39;&#39;&#39; - Associate\n\nSelene&#39;s mind control over Madelyne Pryor eventually waned, and the Black Rook&#39;s allegiance soon turned to Sebastian Shaw.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Man&#39;&#39; #24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned, Selene contacted Fitzroy and Tessa to counteract the changing balance of power.&lt;ref name=\&quot;X-Man #28\&quot;/&gt; Donald Pierce returned to the Hellfire Club as a probationary member,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Cable&#39;&#39; #47&lt;/ref&gt; however his failure in attaining the alien technology of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] resulted in his expulsion from the group.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Cable&#39;&#39; #50-53&lt;/ref&gt; Pryor meanwhile had betrayed and deserted the club. Shaw, presented with a mysterious offer,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #72&lt;/ref&gt; decided to accept its terms and resign from the Inner Circle, advising Fitzroy to do the same.&lt;ref name=\&quot;xmen73\&quot;/&gt;\n\n====Selene&#39;s Hellfire Club====\nSelene, finding herself the sole remaining member of the Inner Circle, reformed the club in her own image and allied with the ruler of Hell, [[Blackheart]]. After a confrontation with the [[Fantastic Four]], Blackheart is imprisoned and Selene&#39;s captive [[Daimon Hellstrom]] is freed; Hellstorm then became the club&#39;s White King to ensure a balance of power and light.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; Annual &#39;99&lt;/ref&gt; Selene would later successfully induct [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] (Roberto da Costa, son of former Black Rook Emmanuel da Costa) into the Inner Circle,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Force&#39;&#39; #98-100&lt;/ref&gt; offering the resurrection of his long-dead girlfriend, Julianna, who died saving his life.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Graphic Novel&#39;&#39; #4 (\&quot;The New Mutants\&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Queen\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Blackheart]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black King\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Daimon Hellstrom]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - White King\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa (Sunspot)]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black Rook\n\nIt is unknown what led to the dissolution of this incarnation.

Members of this version were never given titles since they were revealed to be psionic projections created by Emma Frost at the behest of [[Cassandra Nova]]. In an attempt to free herself the X-Men, Cassandra had placed a portion of her consciousness in Frost&#39;s prior to being mentally imprisoned and launched an assault on the [[X-Mansion]] by using Emma as a Trojan horse. Other than Cassandra Nova, each member appears to represent a different aspect of Emma&#39;s past with [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead (comics)|Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] being a former student of hers who died in [[Genosha]]; Perfection, a manifestation of Emma&#39;s younger, evil self and Sebastian Shaw representing her time with the Hellfire Club.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Astonishing X-Men&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #13-18&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Selene&#39;s second Inner Circle====\nSelene, finding herself once again the sole remaining member of the Inner Circle, and disappointed by the many betrayals from Sebastian Shaw and his Hellfire Club, decided it was time to rise to goddesshood, a state she believed she was destined for.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Necrosha&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt; To accomplish that, she specifically recruited a Coven of deadly mutants to seek revenge against all those that had betrayed her or stood in her way in the past. Together they went to the New York branch of the Hellfire Club, where she cut all ties with them by using her new Inner Circle to slaughter every person there. This Inner Circle was made up of mostly by mutants whose abilities were designed for killing. Membership consisted of:\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Blink (comics)#Earth-616 Blink|Blink]]&#39;&#39;&#39; \n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Senyaka]]&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Lois London|Mortis]]&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Wither (comics)|Wither]]&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Eli Bard]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - only non-mutant member. Turned into a vampire-like creature by Selene.\n\n====The Sixth Inner Circle====\nSebastian Shaw&#39;s Inner Circle eventually reemerged. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] came into confrontation with a new \&quot;Inner Circle\&quot;, under the false impression (by Sebastian Shaw and  \&quot;[[Miss Sinister]]\&quot;) that they are behind the kidnapping of his son, [[Daken]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: Legacy&#39;&#39; #215&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Miss Sinister|Claudine Renko (Miss Sinister)]]&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Mr. Castlemere&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Turner&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Peter Scholl (Leonine)&#39;&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Mercedes&#39;&#39;&#39;\n\n====The Seventh Inner Circle====\nIn the event \&quot;Schism\&quot;, there has apparently been a pro-human coup in the Hellfire Club, all mutant members have been removed, and 12-year-old supergenius Kade Kilgore has been named the new Black King.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: Schism&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt; Kilgore then called together a cabal of prepubescent geniuses to secretly rule the Hellfire Club and eradicate mutantkind, then proceeding to poison the other remaining Hellfire Club members, making them the sole leadership.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: Schism&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: Schism&#39;&#39; #5&lt;/ref&gt; Kade Kilgore later had a change of heart and began recruiting mutants to his side to train the newly manifested mutants at the Hellfire Academy.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Wolverine and the X-Men #20\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Wolverine and the X-Men&#39;&#39; #20&lt;/ref&gt; The Hellfire Academy is destroyed by the staff of the Jean Grey School.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Wolverine and the X-Men #35\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Wolverine and the X-Men&#39;&#39; #35&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Kade Kilgore&#39;&#39;&#39; - Black King.

At the end of the saga Shaw, Pierce, and Frost escape, Wyngarde is left catatonic, and Leland is missing following a fight with Wolverine.\n* The animated series &#39;&#39;[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]&#39;&#39; featured the Inner Circle composed of [[Emma Frost]], [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Harry Leland]], [[Donald Pierce]], [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], and the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]. This Inner Circle appears more closely related to the Ultimate Marvel series, as a group who is obsessed solely with attaining the power of the Phoenix. In the episode \&quot;Shades of Grey,\&quot; Emma Frost telepathically puts the X-Men to sleep so that the Hellfire Club can abduct Jean Grey. In the three-part episode \&quot;Foresight,\&quot; Sebastian Shaw, Harry Leland, Donald Pierce, and Selene prepare a ritual that would extract the Phoenix Force from Jean Grey and place it in the Stepford Cuckoos. Emma Frost warned them against the plan, but her warnings fell on deaf ears. When the Phoenix was released, the ceiling fell on top of Leland and Pierce. Emma Frost used her telepathy to subdue Shaw and Selene.\n* The Hellfire Club (once again under the name Inner Circle) were featured in &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]&#39;&#39;. In the first episode, they were seen trying to manipulate Jean Grey into using the Phoenix Force for their own use until Jean Grey sacrifices herself. This show also includes some exclusive Inner Circle mutants who assisted Mastermind in his plans to rule humanity: &#39;&#39;&#39;Rat&#39;&#39;&#39; (voiced by Manabu Sakamaki in the Japanese version and by [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] in the English dub) can project the metal discs on his body, &#39;&#39;&#39;Marsh&#39;&#39;&#39; (voiced by [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]] in the Japanese version and by [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] in the English dub) can dissolve into liquid, and &#39;&#39;&#39;Neuron&#39;&#39;&#39; (voiced by [[Yutaka Aoyama]] in the Japanese version and by [[Dave Wittenberg]] in the English dub) is the White Bishop who has a shell on his back and can amplify anyone&#39;s senses with strips that come out of his body. During the final showdown, Rat was killed by Wolverine and Storm, Marsh was killed by Cyclops, Neuron was killed by Wolverine, and Mastermind was killed by Takeo Sasaki.\n* A live action television series titled &#39;&#39;Hellfire&#39;&#39; was under development by [[20th Century Fox Television]] and [[Marvel Television]] with an early 2017 air date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/25282/fox_in_development_on_hellfire_working_title?linkId=17951885 |title=Fox in Development on &#39;Hellfire&#39; (Working Title) |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |date=October 14, 2015 |access-date=October 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017013533/http://marvel.com/news/tv/25282/fox_in_development_on_hellfire_working_title?linkId=17951885 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/x-men-hellfire-club-premiere/|title=&#39;X-Men&#39; Spinoff &#39;Hellfire Club&#39; May Premiere Early 2017; Plus a Minor &#39;Rambo&#39; Update|publisher=/Film|last=Topel|first=Fred|date=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on July 12, 2016, &#39;&#39;Variety&#39;&#39; reports that the project is no longer moving forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/marvel-fox-series-matt-nix-pilot-commmitment-1201812851/|title=Marvel &#39;X-Men&#39; Series from Matt Nix, Bryan Singer Lands Put Pilot Commitment at Fox (EXCLUSIVE)|publisher=Variety|last=Wagmeister|first=Elizabeth|date=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Hellfire Club appears in &#39;&#39;[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]&#39;&#39; television series. In the first season [[Stepford Cuckoos]] are revealed to be working for the Hellfire Club, convincing several characters to join them in the season finale. In the second season Reeva Payge takes control of the Inner Circle and pursues a goal of mutant liberation.

[http://aintitcool.com/node/46217 \&quot;So Bryan Singer just called regarding Matthew Vaughn&#39;s X-MEN: FIRST CLASS... I&#39;m quite excited now.\&quot;] [[Ain&#39;t It Cool News]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hellfire Club is led by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] ([[Kevin Bacon]]) and [[Emma Frost]] ([[January Jones]]), with [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] ([[Jason Flemyng]]), [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]] ([[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (actor)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]]), and [[Angel Salvadore]] ([[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]]) as the main members (Although Angel was initially a member of the X-Men before she defected). Their overall goal is to start [[World War III]] in order to wipe out the human race from Earth, allowing the mutants to rise up and take over as the survivor race, with Shaw as the leader of the new world order. To this end, they manipulate American and Soviet government officials to instigate the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], prompting CIA agent [[Moira MacTaggert]] to supervise the initial formation of the X-Men, coordinated by [[Charles Xavier]], his adoptive sister [[Raven Darkholme|Raven]], new ally [[Erik Lensherr]], and CIA scientist [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], to oppose them. At the end of the movie, Sebastian Shaw is killed by Magneto while many of its members (Emma Frost, Azazel, Riptide, Angel and Raven) join Magneto and his new group the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].\n* The Hellfire Club were originally planned to return in &#39;&#39;[[X-Men: Dark Phoenix]]&#39;&#39; with a lineup consisting of Harry Leland, Freidrich Von Roehm, the [[Fenris (comics)|Strucker Twins]], Shinobi Shaw, a returning Emma Frost and the [[Red Lotus (comics)|Red Lotus]] Gang, but they were ultimately not used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbr.com/dark-phoenix-concept-art-x-men-hellfire-club|title=Dark Phoenix Concept Art Debuts X-Men Nemeses, The Hellfire Club|last=Chapman|first=Tom|work=CBR|access-date=December 19, 2019|date=December 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Video games===\n* Emma Frost was a boss character in the &#39;&#39;[[X-Men (1992 video game)|X-Men]]&#39;&#39; arcade game by Konami in 1992, loosely based on the \&quot;Pryde of the X-Men\&quot; pilot.\n* The Hellfire Club have appeared in numerous X-Men video games as villains in various stages specifically within the Hellfire Mansion with the final boss almost always being Sebastian Shaw. The Hellfire Club Mansion appeared as the first stage in X-Men (Game Gear System) as well as &#39;&#39;[[X-Men 2: Game Master&#39;s Legacy]]&#39;&#39; (Game Gear). Another game they appeared in was &#39;&#39;[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]&#39;&#39;.\n* The Hellfire Club appears as antagonist in the video game &#39;&#39;[[Wolverine: Adamantium Rage]],&#39;&#39; for the SNES and Sega Genesis, with Selene and Shinobi Shaw appearing as bosses in their stage.\n* The Hellfire Club appears in &#39;&#39;[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]&#39;&#39;. In the Spec Ops part of the game, Emma Frost tells Nick Fury and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent that someone is claiming her former title as White Queen. Their foot soldiers consist of Hellfire Elites, Hellfire Gunners, Hellfire Heavies, Hellfire Hunters, Hellfire Officers, and Hellfire Snipers. The Hellfire Club has also received help in their goals from [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] (who built the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] that obey the Hellfire Club&#39;s every commands), [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]]. In the 6th Spec Ops mission, the Hellfire Club brings Living Pharaoh out of stasis and plots to help him transform into [[Living Monolith]]. This time, the Hellfire Club have also enlisted the help of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], and [[Dragoness (comics)|Dragoness]]. Also the Hellfire Club is a major antagonist in the first chapter of the second season, with [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] making her first appearance, as a boss in the mission 5. Special Operations 19: Fratricide follows the storyline of the remnants of the Brotherhood being hunted down by [[Mr. Sinister]], [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], and the Hellfire Club.
