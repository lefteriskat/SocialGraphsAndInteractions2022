The character was created in 1959 by writer [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and artist [[Gil Kane]], and first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #22 (October 1959). Hal Jordan is a reinvention of the previous Green Lantern who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character [[Alan Scott]].\n\nHal Jordan is a former fighter pilot who works for Ferris Aircraft as a test pilot, a member and occasionally leader of an intergalactic police force called the [[Green Lantern Corps]], as well as a founding member of the [[Justice League]], DC&#39;s flagship superhero team, alongside well-known heroes such as [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. He fights evil across the universe with a ring that grants him a variety of superpowers, but is usually portrayed as one of the protectors of Sector 2814, which is the sector where Earth resides. His powers derive from his [[power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] and Green Lantern battery, which in the hands of someone capable of overcoming great fear allows the user to channel their [[will (philosophy)|will power]] into creating all manner of fantastic constructs. Jordan uses this power to fly, even through the vacuum of space; to create shields, swords, and lasers; and to construct his Green Lantern costume, which protects his [[secret identity]] in his civilian life on Earth. Jordan and all other Green Lanterns are monitored and empowered by the mysterious [[Guardians of the Universe]], who were developed from an idea editor [[Julius Schwartz]] and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring [[Captain Comet]] in &#39;&#39;[[Strange Adventures]] #22&#39;&#39; (July 1952) entitled \&quot;Guardians of the Clockwork Universe\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/03/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-148 comic book urban legends revealed #148], [[comicbookresources.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the 1990s, Jordan also appeared as a villain. The story line &#39;&#39;Emerald Twilight&#39;&#39; saw a Jordan traumatized by the supervillain [[Mongul]]&#39;s destruction of Jordan&#39;s hometown [[Coast City]], adopt the name \&quot;[[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]\&quot;, and threaten to destroy the universe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #50: Emerald Twilight, Part Three: The Future&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, DC Comics rehabilitated the character, first by having Jordan seek redemption for his actions as Parallax, and later by revealing that Parallax was in fact an evil cosmic entity that corrupted Jordan and took control of his actions. Between the character&#39;s stint as Parallax and his return to DC Comics as a heroic Green Lantern once more, the character also briefly served as [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]], a supernatural character in DC Comics stories who acts as [[Presence (DC Comics)|God]]&#39;s wrathful agent on Earth.\n\nOutside of comics, Hal Jordan has appeared in various animated projects, video games and live-action. Jordan&#39;s original design in the comics was based on actor [[Paul Newman]],&lt;ref name=\&quot;stow\&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stowe |first1=Dusty |title=15 Things You Didn&#39;t Know About Green Lantern |url=https://screenrant.com/green-lantern-trivia-facts/#:~:text=6%20Hal%20Jordan%20Was%20Based%20On%20Paul%20Newman&amp;text=Artist%20Gil%20Kane%20(who%20had,who%20moonlights%20as%20a%20superhero. |website=Screenrant.com |date=3 August 2017 |publisher=Valnet, Inc. |access-date=12 May 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the character is ranked 7th on [[IGN]]&#39;s in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/7|title=IGN&#39;s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|access-date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Hal Jordan placed 4th on [[IGN]]&#39;s Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics |title=The Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics |website=IGN |date=2013-11-19 |access-date=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHal Jordan made his cinematic debut in the 2011 film &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]&#39;&#39;, played by [[Ryan Reynolds]].\n\n==Publication history==\n===Recreated for the Silver Age===\nAfter achieving great success in 1956 in reviving the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] character [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] looked toward recreating the Green Lantern from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/12/arts/julius-schwartz-88-editor-who-revived-superhero-genre-in-comic-books.html|title=Julius Schwartz, 88, Editor Who Revived Superhero Genre in Comic Books|last=Nash|first=Eric|date=2004-02-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/07schwartz.html|title=TwoMorrows Publishing - Alter Ego #7 - Julius Schwartz Interview|website=www.twomorrows.com|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from his love for science-fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m43zCAAAQBAJ&amp;q=julius+schwartz+green+lantern&amp;pg=PA195|title=Green Lantern History: An Unauthorised Guide to the DC Comic Book Series Green Lantern|last=Jordan|first=Darran|date=2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781326139636|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} Schwartz intended to show the new Green Lantern in a more modern light, enlisting writer [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and artist [[Gil Kane]], who in 1959 would reintroduce Green Lantern to the world in &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #22 (October 1959) by creating Hal Jordan.\n\nThe character was a success, and it was quickly decided to follow up his three-issue run on &#39;&#39;Showcase&#39;&#39; with a self-titled series. &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; #1 began in July\u2013August 1960 and would continue until #89 in April\u2013May 1972.\n\n[[File:Showcase 22.png|thumb|left|Cover to &#39;&#39;Showcase&#39;&#39; #22 (October 1959), the first appearance of Hal Jordan.

The quartet of Schwartz, Broome, Fox, and Kane remained the core creative team until 1970.\n\n===O&#39;Neil/Adams and socially-conscious Green Lantern/Green Arrow===\nStarting with issue #76 (April 1970), [[Dennis O&#39;Neil]] took over scripting and [[Neal Adams]], who had drawn the cover of issue #63, became the series&#39; artist. O&#39;Neil and Adams had already begun preparation for the classic run in the form of their re-workings of another DC superhero, the archer [[Green Arrow]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;back45\&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wells|first= John|date= December 2010|title = Green Lantern/Green Arrow: And Through Them Change an Industry|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 39\u201354|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:GLGA76BS.jpg|thumb|250px|Three panels ushering in the O&#39;Neil/Adams run in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; #76.]] In an introduction to the 1983 reprinting of this O&#39;Neil/Adams run, O&#39;Neil explains that he wondered if he could represent his own political beliefs in comics and take on social issues of the late sixties and early seventies. O&#39;Neil devised the idea of portraying Hal Jordan, effectively an intergalactic law enforcement officer, as an establishment gradualist liberal figure against Oliver Queen (Green Arrow), who O&#39;Neil had characterized as a lusty outspoken anarchist who would stand in for the counter-culture movement.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&#39;&#39; #1 (October 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these socially motivated Green Lantern/Green Arrow stories was written with [[Gil Kane]] slated to be the artist, but Kane dropped out and was replaced by Neal Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Zimmerman|first= Dwight Jon|date= August 1986|title= Denny O&#39;Neil | work= [[Comics Interview]]|issue= 35|pages= 22\u201337|publisher= [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories tackled questions of power, racism, sexism, and exploitation, and remain viewed in the comics community as the first socially-conscious superhero stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbr.com/green-lantern-green-arrow-still-relevant/|title=Hard-Traveled Tales: Is Green Lantern/Green Arrow Still Relevant?|date=2017-04-08|work=CBR|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDespite the work of Adams and O&#39;Neil, &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; sales had been in a major decline at the time Green Arrow was brought on as co-star, and their stories failed to revive the sales figures.&lt;ref name=\&quot;back45\&quot; /&gt; &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; was canceled with issue #89 (April/May 1972), and the climactic story arc of the Green Lantern/Green Arrow series was published as a back-up feature in &#39;&#39;[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]&#39;&#39; #217 through #219. In sharp contrast to the socially relevant tales which preceded it, this story centered on emotional themes, with Green Arrow struggling to deal with the guilt of having killed a man.&lt;ref name=\&quot;back45\&quot; /&gt; Green Lantern continued to appear in backup stories of &#39;&#39;Flash&#39;&#39; from 1972 until the &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; title was resumed in 1976.\n\n===1980s exile===\nIn &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; #151 (April 1982) through #172 (January 1984), Jordan is exiled into space for a year by the Guardians in order to prove his loyalty to the Green Lantern Corps, having been accused of paying too much attention to Earth when he had an entire \&quot;sector\&quot; of the cosmos to patrol. When he returns to Earth, he finds himself embroiled in a dispute with [[Carol Ferris]]. Faced with a choice between love and the power ring, Jordan resigns from the Corps. The Guardians call Jordan&#39;s backup, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], to regular duty as his replacement.\n\nIn 1985, the \&quot;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\&quot; storyline that rebooted much of DC Comics&#39; character continuity saw Jordan again take up the mantle of Green Lantern. The new Corps, with seven members residing on Earth, included several aliens, John Stewart, and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]. Jordan becomes romantically involved with an alien Lantern named [[Arisia (comics)|Arisia]], for which he comes under fire due to Arisia being only a teenager. The alien Lanterns take a more direct hand in human affairs, a fact not appreciated by human governments. Eventually, the Earth corps break up, several members returning to their home sectors. The Guardians soon return to this dimension, and Jordan works with them to rebuild the fractured Corps.\n\n===1990s===\nDuring this time, the character&#39;s origin story is re-told and expanded in two limited series by [[Keith Giffen]], [[Gerard Jones]], and [[James Owsley]], &#39;&#39;[[Emerald Dawn]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Emerald Dawn II&#39;&#39;. The first series expanded the role of the Corps in his origin and also provided more details about his childhood and his relationship with his father and brothers, while the sequel detailed the role of Jordan in the downfall of Sinestro.\n\nIn the 1992 [[prestige format]] [[graphic novel]] &#39;&#39;Green Lantern: [[Ganthet#Ganthet&#39;s Tale|Ganthet&#39;s Tale]]&#39;&#39;, Hal Jordan first encounters [[Ganthet]], one of the [[Guardians of the Universe]]. Ganthet asks Hal to help him battle a renegade Guardian who has attempted to use a [[Time travel|time machine]] to change history.\n\n[[File:Parallax (Hal Jordan).png|thumb|upright|left|Hal Jordan becomes Parallax. {{Descript-inner-art|[[Green Lantern]]|3|50|Mar, 1994}} Art by [[Darryl Banks]].]]\n\n==== Reign of the Supermen, Destruction of Coast City, and transformation into Parallax ====\nIn the 1993 &#39;&#39;[[The Death of Superman#Reign of the Supermen!|Reign of the Supermen!]]&#39;&#39; storyline, the alien tyrant [[Mongul]] and his forces destroy [[Coast City]] (Jordan&#39;s former home), murdering all of its seven million inhabitants, while Jordan was off world. Angered, he flies to Engine City and attacks Mongul, eventually knocking him out with [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]]&#39;s hammer.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #46. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads into the &#39;&#39;[[Emerald Twilight]]&#39;&#39; arc, which sees Jordan using his power ring to recreate Coast City as an instrument in the process of overcoming his grief, and talking to ring-created versions of his old girlfriend and parents. After his ring&#39;s power expires, a projection of a Guardian appears and admonishes him for using the ring for personal gain and summons him to Oa (the homeworld of the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps) for disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #48. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Angered at what he sees as the Guardians&#39; ungrateful and callous behavior, Jordan absorbs the energy from the Guardian&#39;s projection, goes [[insane]] and attacks Oa to seize the full power of the Central Power Battery (the source of power for all Green Lanterns), defeating and severely injuring several members of the Green Lantern Corps in the process, taking their power rings as his own and leaving them to die in space. He arrives on Oa and kills [[Kilowog]], [[Sinestro]], and all the Guardians except for [[Ganthet]], who was protected by the other Guardians and survived without Jordan&#39;s knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #50. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He then renounces his life as Green Lantern, adopting the name [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] after absorbing the Power Battery&#39;s vast powers.\n\nGanthet designates [[Kyle Rayner]] to replace Jordan as the Green Lantern of Earth when Rayner comes into possession of the last power ring, created from the shattered remains of Jordan&#39;s. Guy Gardner has visions of the Green Lantern Corps&#39; destruction and his yellow power ring&#39;s energy (being powered by residual Green Lantern&#39;s energy) starts to fluctuate. Soon after, Gardner goes to Oa to investigate, bringing [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Darkstar (DC Comics)|Darkstar]] (Ferrin Colos), [[The Ray]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Captain Atom]], [[Alan Scott]] and [[Arisia (comics)|Arisia]] with him. Jordan uses the element of surprise, attacks, and easily defeats them, leaving Guy in a coma. After the battle, Jordan sends them all back to Earth warning them to leave him alone in the future. Not long afterwards, Parallax attempts to rewrite history to his own liking with the help of [[Hank Hall|Extant]] in the universe-wide event &#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]&#39;&#39;. Parallax destroys the [[Time Trapper]] and attempts to remake the universe into a perfect, peaceful place, causing time disruptions throughout the universe. Superman, Kyle Rayner and [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] call upon Earth&#39;s heroes to stop the mysterious disturbances. Jordan and Extant are eventually defeated when Hal exhausts most of his power from both fighting and manipulating the time stream. Green Arrow then takes advantage of Jordan&#39;s drained state and shoots an arrow into a weakened Jordan&#39;s chest.\n\nJordan makes a brief and redemptory appearance as Parallax in the 1996 &#39;&#39;[[Final Night]]&#39;&#39; miniseries/crossover storyline, apparently sacrificing his life to combat a threat to the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Night&#39;&#39; #4.

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after assuming this mantle, Jordan chooses to bend his mission from a spirit of vengeance to one of redemption, also making other appearances through some of DC Comics&#39; other story lines, such as advising [[Superman]] during the &#39;&#39;Emperor Joker&#39;&#39; storyline (where the Joker steals the reality-warping power of [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]) and erases all public knowledge of [[Wally West]]&#39;s identity as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] after his terrible first battle with [[Hunter Zolomon|Zoom]], which led to his wife miscarrying their twins. He also appeared in a 4-part story arc in the series &#39;&#39;Legends of the DC Universe&#39;&#39; (issues #33\u201336). A new series based on this premise, titled &#39;&#39;The Spectre&#39;&#39; (vol. 4), ran for 27 issues from 2001 to 2003. In it, Hal loses his beloved brother, Jack Jordan, to a supernatural assassin. After the series ended, Jordan was forced to return, temporarily, to the Spectre&#39;s mission of vengeance, following a confrontation between the new [[Justice Society of America]] and the [[Spirit King]], an old foe of the Spectre and [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)|Mister Terrific]], who had managed to \&quot;resurrect\&quot; the ghosts of all those the Spectre had damned to Hell when Jordan&#39;s attempt to turn the Spectre&#39;s mission to redemption weakened his hold on the damned, until Hal &#39;accepted&#39; his original mission of vengeance.\n\nDuring the &#39;&#39;[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]&#39;&#39; storyline, Green Arrow visits Jordan at his grave, asking to exact revenge on [[Sue Dibny]]&#39;s killer. Although Hal admits knowing the culprit&#39;s identity (revealed later was [[Jean Loring]]), he refused as the Spectre to a higher purpose, and implying to Oliver that the killer would eventually be caught, thus explaining the Spectre&#39;s inaction.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Identity Crisis&#39;&#39; #4 (October 2004). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2004, DC launched the &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]&#39;&#39; miniseries which brought Hal Jordan back to life and made him a Green Lantern once again, and in a redesigned Corps uniform. Shortly after the conclusion of &#39;&#39;Rebirth&#39;&#39;, DC Comics began a new &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) series, beginning with a new #1 and retconning his past murders as Parallax as the result of an intergalactic fear-driven parasite. The Green Lantern Corps has also been successfully rebuilt. Despite the revelation that Hal&#39;s past villainous activity was because of the influence of the parasite Parallax, many of his fellow Corps officers are unwilling to trust him, even Jordan, on some levels, believes the reason that Parallax succeeded in possessing him was because he surrendered to it, and thus acknowledges that he truly has a dark side. Despite being freed from Parallax, his experience also leads him occasionally to have a lack of confidence and self-doubt, making him no longer a daredevil he once was. Jordan also becomes friends with Kyle Rayner after their first battle with Parallax. In the new volume, Jordan moves to the nearly deserted Coast City, which is slowly being rebuilt. Reinstated as a captain in the United States Air Force, Jordan now works in the test pilot program at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. The series introduces new supporting characters for Hal, including a man from his and his late-father&#39;s pasts, Air Force General Jonathan \&quot;Herc\&quot; Stone, who learns his secret identity during a battle with the Manhunters and acts as his ally. He also begins to develop a romantic attraction with his fellow pilot, the beautiful Captain [[Jillian Pearlman|Jillian \&quot;Cowgirl\&quot; Pearlman]].&lt;ref name=GL1&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #1 (May 2005).

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A new account of Green Lantern&#39;s origins is also released as part of this series. In this new origin, Hal Jordan is working as an assistant mechanic under Tom Kalmaku, barred from flying due to his insubordination while in the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and his employer&#39;s lingering guilt about his father&#39;s death in the line of duty. Green Lantern [[Abin Sur]], while fighting the villain [[Atrocitus]], crashes near Coast City. Knowing he is close to death, Sur sends his ring to seek a replacement (as all rings do when their wearer dies), and his ring fetches Jordan. Sur then informs Jordan that he is to replace him as the Green Lantern of Sector 2814.&lt;ref name=\&quot;GL29\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #29 (March 2008).

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He also fights alongside a group of heroes against the [[Society of Supervillains]], defending [[Metropolis(comics)|Metropolis]].

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs part of DC&#39;s post-Infinite Crisis retconning of the entire universe, all current stories skipped ahead one year in an event called [[One Year Later]]. This brought drastic changes to Hal Jordan&#39;s life, as with every other hero in the DC Universe. It is revealed that Jordan spent time as a P.O.W. in an unnamed conflict and has feelings of guilt from his inability to free himself and his fellow captives.&lt;ref name=\&quot;GL17\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #14 (September 2006). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==== &#39;&#39;Sinestro Corps War&#39;&#39; and other Pre-Flashpoint stories ====\nHal and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps find themselves at war with [[Sinestro]] and his army, the [[Sinestro Corps]] during the events of the [[Sinestro Corps War]]&lt;ref name=GLSCS&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern Sinestro Corps Special&#39;&#39;. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As a Green Lantern native to Earth, Hal is featured in the [[Final Crisis]] mini-series by [[Grant Morrison]].&lt;ref name=FC1&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the Agent Orange story arc, Jordan is briefly in command of [[Agent Orange (DC Comics)|Agent Orange]]&#39;s power battery after he steals it from Agent Orange in a battle. The orange light of avarice converses with Jordan, his costume changes, and he becomes the new Agent Orange. However, [[Agent Orange (DC Comics)|Larfleeze]] quickly takes his power battery back from Jordan.&lt;ref name=GL42&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #42 (June 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nJordan is also a character of focus in the new &#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; series as a charter member of the revamped JLA. He is also involved in the first plotline of the &#39;&#39;[[Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; monthly series, teaming up first with [[Batman]] and later [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. When teamed with the fledgling Supergirl, Hal is very impressed with her cleverness, although he finds her flirtatious behavior somewhat unnerving.&lt;ref name=BB2&gt;&#39;&#39;The Brave and the Bold&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]&#39;&#39; mini-series, Hal leads his own &#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; with [[Green Arrow]], [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Shazam]], Supergirl, [[Congo Bill#Congorilla|Congorilla]], [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], [[Batwoman]], and the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] in order to avenge the deaths of [[Martian Manhunter]] and Batman.&lt;ref name=JLCJ1&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League: Cry for Justice&#39;&#39; #1 (July 2009). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan eventually recruits some of the former [[Teen Titans|Titans]] members for the League&#39;s new lineup, including Batman&#39;s successor [[Dick Grayson]], Donna Troy, and Starfire.\n\n===2010s===\n{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}\n\nDuring the &#39;&#39;[[Blackest Night]]&#39;&#39; event, Hal allies himself with six other Lantern Corps during The War of Light. He finds himself facing many of his deceased allies, enemies, and people he failed to save reanimated as undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]s under the control of the Green Lantern Corps&#39; ancient enemy [[Nekron]]. Hal finds himself not only teaming up with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (otherwise known as [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]), who is also resurrected from his death, but also must work with his enemies Sinestro, Atrocitus, Larfleeze, and his former lover Carol Ferris.\n\n====The New 52====\nIn 2011, after the universe-altering event [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]], DC Comics relaunched its entire line of stories. In this era, Jordan returns to civilian life on Earth, having been discharged from the United States Air Force. This iteration of the hero, written by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Robert Venditti]], sees him team up with the villain [[Sinestro]] as the pair encounter ramifications of the Brightest Day/Blackest Night storylines, as well as a crossover with &#39;&#39;New Gods&#39;&#39; characters in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Godhead.&#39;&#39;\n\nHal Jordan is featured as a part of Justice League series relaunch as well. The initial issues of the title take place five years prior as Jordan assists [[Batman]] against [[Darkseid|a mysterious threat]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1 (August 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; It is shown he is already friends with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and each know the other&#39;s secret identity.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Hal also believes with the ring he can overcome anything by himself by sheer force of will. This leads to reckless behavior that almost gets him killed. It is only when Batman reminds him of his mortality by revealing his own identity as Bruce Wayne that Hal reconsiders his approach.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #5 (January 2012). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the team forms, Green Lantern resigns from the Justice League in an effort to keep the group functioning after his behavior put the team in peril during their fight with [[David Graves (comics)|David Graves]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #12 (August 2012). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he returns to the Justice League to help [[Jessica Cruz]] learn how to control her powers.\n\nIn the aftermath, Hal gets a new look as he goes rogue from the Green Lantern Corps in order to create a scapegoat for the Corps and be the focus of the universe&#39;s blame and distrust for everything that had taken place in recent issues, such as the Third Army&#39;s assault or Relic&#39;s attack. The Corps itself \u2013 unaware of Jordan&#39;s intentions to show the universe that the Green Lanterns are not corrupt and will go after one of their own \u2013 believes that he has actually betrayed them when he attacks Kilowog. Along the way, Jordan steals a Green Lantern prototype gauntlet and power pack from the armoury, allowing him to continue to operate as a hero without the need for a power ring, although he is sometimes required to fight other Lanterns to maintain the illusion of independence.\n\n====DC Rebirth====\nIn 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called \&quot;[[DC Rebirth]]\&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to \&quot;The New 52\&quot;. Jordan returns to Earth temporarily to assign Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz the task of protecting Earth while he and the rest of the human Green Lanterns are away. He takes their power batteries and fuses them into a single battery to help the two bond as Lantern partners.\n\nSubsequently, in &#39;&#39;[[DC Rebirth]]&#39;&#39;, Hal returns as Green Lantern again, now equipped with his self-constructed power ring, searching for the rest of the Green Lanterns and hunting down the Sinestro Corps. Hal takes on several Yellow Lanterns before fighting Sinestro and getting injured. He is healed by Soranik, Sinestro&#39;s daughter who now is a Yellow Lantern like her father. After being healed, he takes on and defeats Sinestro and saves Guy Gardner, who was being tortured by Sinestro. Hal is now reunited with the Green Lanterns who have entered a war with the Sinestro Corps. The battle leads them to the planet of Green Lantern Tomar-Tu. As they fight, Braniac shrinks the planet with the Lanterns in it. The shrunken planet is given to the Grand Collector which turns out to be Larfleeze, the Orange Lantern. Hal is believed to be dead in the destruction that came with the shrinking of the planet. He has been transported to the Emerald Space, an afterlife for deceased Lanterns. Guardians, Ganthet and Sayd call upon White Lantern Kyle Rayner to rescue Hal. Kyle pulls him out of the Emerald Space and the two meet up with the rest and escape from the shrunken planet and restore it. Larfleeze escapes with his orange construct Lanterns. The Green and Yellow Lanterns form an alliance.\n\nJordan appears with the Justice League in the &#39;&#39;Dark Nights: Metal&#39;&#39; mini-series.\n\n==== The Green Lantern ====\nWith writer [[Grant Morrison]] taking the helm, Jordan returns to interstellar duty after a brief reprieve. Discovering a cosmic conspiracy is afoot, Jordan, under the orders of The Guardians Of The Universe, goes undercover and infiltrates the ranks of the sinister new threat of Controller Mu&#39;s Blackstars. There&#39;s a double-agent in the Green Lantern force, a traitor who&#39;s aiding these new antagonists and the undercover op is undertaken to root out the mole, while Jordan can gather intel and take down the threat. Mu is a lone [[Controllers (DC Comics)|Controller]], with his Blackstars being an extremist separatist sect and a true cult, treating the idea of &#39;control&#39; as almost a kind of religion. The story seems Jordan dealing with the threat of The Blackstars, while forming a dynamic with their general, Countess Belzebeth. With The Blackstars hunting for 5 mysterious &#39;components&#39; to change reality, Jordan is faced with tough cases to crack. He arrests a Terravore pretending to be god and busts Volgar Zo&#39;s Planet Trafficking Ring, resolving the issue of Grand Theft Planet. He finds his old foe [[Evil Star|Evil Star&#39;s]] Star-Band stolen by The Blackstars. He dons the persona of &#39;The Man With No Name&#39; to find intel. He faces the deadly trials and tests of a Blackstar on the Vampire World of Vorr. He then, with the aid of Belzebeth, joins The Blackstars in proper fashion and is dubbed a Knight of O.M.E.N. (Over-Master&#39;s Executive Network), the network under which all Blackstars operate. And as is law in the cult, he takes on a new name: Blackstar Parallax. He then faces down his old pal Adam Strange, forced to kill him to prove his loyalty to Mu and wins, while actually sparing and saving Adam&#39;s life through deceit. He then teams up with Adam, his wife Alanna and their daughter Alea to save the day. Controller Mu is killed by Alanna after he calls Jordan&#39;s bluff and his cover&#39;s busted. But Mu&#39;s &#39;death&#39; sets off The U-Bomb to end the universe, which Jordan stops utilizing the power of the all Green Lanterns, mainlining The Central Power Battery. Then he vanishes, savior once more, presumed dead.  But he&#39;s in truth spared and saved by his ring, which took him inside the universe it contains, where in classic foe [[Myrwhydden]] is caged. There he meets the A.I of his ring, Pengowirr (an anagram of Power Ring), and better understands the nature of his bond with his ring. From there onwards, he is able to consistently converse with the ring, as the partnership deepens.\n\nHal reunites with Green Arrow and goes on an adventure busting up an assassin from a cosmic cartel of Hadea Maxima, while dealing with a drug dealer from Dimension Zero, Glorigold DeGrande. Teaming up with Xeen Arrow and Xeen Lantern, the heroes save the day by shooting a giant cosmic arrow at the assassin Azmomza on Earth&#39;s moon. Hal then takes off for R&amp;R on Athmoora, the fantasy world of 2814 and faces the evil wizard Ah-Bah-Nazzur, who turns out to be a Blackstar mind-controlled Green Lantern of Earth-20, Abin Sur. Teaming up with him and The Guardians Of The Multiverse, a team of multiversal Green Lanterns, a cosmic interpol, Hal faces off against The Anti-Man/The Qwa-Man, The Mad Lantern, who is his Anti-Matter counterpart, set loose by Controller Mu and The Blackstars. From there on, he reunites with Uugo, The Conscious Planet, Strong-Woman Of Thronn and joins this team on a rescue operation for The Star Sapphire of Earth-11 on the forbidden universe of Earth-15. Becoming part of The Cosmic Grail Quest, Jordan finds himself in grave danger facing a mysterious Lantern figure.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Main|Power ring (DC Comics)}}\nAs a Green Lantern, Hal Jordan is semi-invulnerable, capable of projecting hard-light constructions, flight, and utilizing various other abilities through his power ring which are only limited by his imagination and willpower. Jordan, as a Green Lantern, has exceptional willpower.\n\nAs Parallax, Hal was one of the most powerful beings in all of the DC Universe. In addition to his normal Green Lantern powers, he was able to manipulate and reconfigure time-space to his will, manipulate reality at a large scale, had vast superhuman strength which he demonstrated by being able to knock out Superman with one punch, a higher sense of awareness and enhanced durability. As Parallax, he was still able to be harmed nearly just as easily as a normal Green Lantern but seemed to be able to endure more physical punishment. While Hal Jordan was Parallax, he was never defeated by physical force; all of his very few defeats were of a changed mental state during or after the battle, which was usually the result of dealing with his own conscience, and he would just give up, leave the battle, and hide himself.\n\n==Other versions==\nAs with other characters published by DC Comics, many alternative universe versions and analogues of the character have appeared within both the Green Lantern series and other titles.\n\n*In &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #856, a [[Bizarro]] version of Hal, called Yellow Lantern, is featured. Yellow Lantern possessed a [[Sinestro Corps]] ring and used it to inflict fear among [[Htrae]]&#39;s inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #856.

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; although he is rescued by the Hawks and manages to reclaim his hand and ring later.\n* In the DC/Marvel Company crossover series [[Amalgam Comics]], there appeared to be two amalgams of Hal. [[Iron Lantern]] was the amalgam of Hal Jordan and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. His identity was known as Hal Stark. Another unknown amalgam of Hal Jordan appeared in &#39;&#39;[[List of Amalgam Comics publications#Speed Demon|Speed Demon]]&#39;&#39; #1, in which the [[Speed Demon (Amalgam Comics)|Speed Demon]] killed \&quot;Madman\&quot; Jordan, as apparently this Jordan had committed a horrible crime.\n* Hal Jordan is a character in &#39;&#39;[[JLA/Avengers]]&#39;&#39;, which featured a [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] between DC and Marvel Comics. Despite the fact that both teams travel to both of their respective universes, this is one of the few comics featuring multiple universes that remains in (DC) continuity. During this story, Hal gets a vision of his future as Parallax in the &#39;real&#39; universe after a reality is created where the two universes have regularly interacted for years, but nevertheless resolves to restore reality as the heroes cannot choose their lives over the lives of those being affected by the current chronal disruption.\n* An alternate version of Hal Jordan also appeared in the Pocket Universe Earth created by the [[Time Trapper]]. He, along with various other heroes who had no superpowers in this reality, teamed up with a good version of [[Lex Luthor]] to stop three evil Kryptonians who had escaped from the [[Phantom Zone]]. Hal Jordan piloted an advanced jet craft that was easily destroyed by the Kryptonians.\n* Though Jordan was never one of the main characters in the award-winning mini-series &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39;, a version of him from the Earth-22 (A post &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]) made a cameo at the end of the storyline\&quot; &#39;&#39;Thy Kingdom Come&#39;&#39;\&quot; story arc on the issue of &#39;&#39;[[Justice Society of America]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #22, during Batman&#39;s funeral.\n* A new version of [[Power Ring (DC supervillains)|Power Ring]], the villainous Green Lantern analogue of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], appeared and is stated as being the \&quot;original\&quot; (though previously unseen) iteration of the character. He has been presumed dead years earlier. It is implied that he was reborn in his reality as a direct result of Jordan&#39;s resurrection in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Rebirth&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #50 (2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* In the alternate timeline of the &#39;&#39;[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]&#39;&#39; event, Hal Jordan was reckless as a flying ace. He along with Carol Ferris was on an F-22 Raptor entering Western Europe territory before the [[Shark (comics)|Shark]] attacks. Hal forces the Shark to crash his jet into Carol&#39;s jet, and both of them barely got out of the ejection system. Upon their return to America, Hal was about to fly the jet. However, he witnesses a spaceship crash to Earth and was approached by the ship&#39;s survivor, Abin Sur, asking for help.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Flashpoint: Hal Jordan&#39;&#39; #1 (June 2011).

Hal&#39;s only option is to fly through New Themyscira on a [[suicide attack]], causing a process which destroys not only New Themyscira&#39;s invisible shield, but Hal with it. Afterwards, [[Thomas Kalmaku]] gives Carol a note saying that Hal was afraid to say that he had always loved her.

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* The comic book prequel tie-in to the &#39;&#39;Injustice&#39;&#39; game series:\n** In the prequel comic to &#39;&#39;[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]&#39;&#39;, that universe&#39;s Hal Jordan willingly joining Superman&#39;s group of heroes in obtaining peace on Earth through more forceful matters. However, he became an unwitting pawn to both Sinestro and Superman.\n** In the prequel to the &#39;&#39;[[Injustice 2]]&#39;&#39; game, after Superman&#39;s Regime has been defeated, Hal admits his guilt and accepts full responsibility for his past deeds as an unwitting pawn to the Regime and Yellow Lantern. As he is a very important figure to the Green Lantern Corps, the Guardians enact a rehabilitation program as part of his atonement. Due to his newfound hatred towards Sinestro for tricking him into believing that Guy Gardner killed John Stewart, he gets into a fight with him and unintentionally catches the Red Lantern Corps&#39; attention, giving them the opportunity to locate Sinestro before he is sent to another prison. During the rehabilitation program, Hal is often visited by Guy&#39;s spirit, who reveals himself to be a manifestation of Hal&#39;s guilt. After a brutal attack by Atrocitus and the Red Lantern Corps, Hal rescues the remaining Green Lanterns and becomes a Red Lantern to ensure their escape from the planet. Upon learning that Red Lanterns recruited Starro, Hal still has the remaining will to break free from the red power ring&#39;s influence to warn the other Green Lanterns and Guardians about this. He cuts his finger that has a red power ring to proof his attempt to warn the Green Lanterns and Guardians about the Red Lanterns&#39; attack on Oa using Starro, but was too late to prepare the enemy Lanterns&#39; quick arrival. Even with the help from Titans members Starfire, Wonder Girl and Superboy, including Jaime Reyes/the current Blue Beetle, Booster Gold and Lobo, but still no match against the Red Lanterns&#39; might thanks to Starro&#39;s mind control on other Green Lanterns and the Guardians, Hal has no choice to join the fight as a Green Lantern while overcoming his guilt on his own merit and needs Sinestro&#39;s aid only temporarily, including turning Lobo into a Green Lantern without any choice. Thanks to the interference of Brainiac&#39;s army for causing the Red Lanterns&#39; retreat and leaving Starro to handle its destructive reign on Oa, who attempts to take a Kryptonian DNA sample from Superboy, the Green Lanterns and the Titans won; however, Sinestro seemingly died sacrificing his life saving his daughter from Starro&#39;s control, Booster Gold sacrifices his life to save Jaime, who implanted the Blue Beetle Scarab to self-destruct Starro once and for all, while Superboy and Wonder Girl are now staying safe with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in a distant future to clear Superman and Wonder Woman&#39;s names from their past reign. Guy urges Hal to keep looking for the true meaning of redemption to make up for his past mistakes, before departing for the afterlife.\n* In the possible future of &#39;&#39;[[The New 52: Futures End|Futures End]]&#39;&#39;, Hal Jordan had left his role as Corps leader behind, promising to never again leave Earth unprotected after a gruesome war killed thousands of people, including Hal&#39;s mother. Living what looks like a bachelor&#39;s life in Coast City, Hal learns from his deceased father that Krona has become the new leader of the Black Lantern Corps, which forces Hal to renege on his vow and to take them head on with only the help of a new ally, Relic. The ensuing battle occurs near the [[Source Wall]], which is a miniature Blackest Night version, with Relic giving Hal access to the rest of the emotional spectrum needed to handle his foes. As Hal is quickly overrun, he sacrifices himself to end the Black Lantern threat once and for all. Critically wounded and barely alive, Hal is placed inside the Source Wall, just like Relic was.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Futures End&#39;&#39; #1.

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When Brainiac explains that he can send the heroes home, he is prevented by damage from the original &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; event from restoring the universe to normal.

Harley tricks him to take her to the airfield, where she knocks him out and steals his plane.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;DC Bombshells&#39;&#39; #4. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* In the series &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Earth One]]&#39;&#39;, set in the near future, Hal Jordan is a former astronaut who worked on a joint project between NASA and Monarcha Energy to build Arrowhead, an orbital platform which was intended to be used for deep space exploration, but which Jordan discovered was in fact a [[space weapon]]. It is implied that Arrowhead was used in a coup which ushered in an authoritarian regime. Feeling responsible for not speaking up, and disillusioned with humanity, Hal took a job as an asteroid miner with [[Ferris Aircraft|Ferris Galactic]] in an attempt to leave Earth. Jordan stumbles across one of the few remaining power rings in the galaxy, as the Green Lantern Corps was wiped out by the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]] generations ago. Thrust into the wider galaxy, Jordan teams up with [[Kilowog]], a ring-bearer and the descendant of a Green Lantern, and begins searching for allies against the Manhunters. After repeatedly failing to enlist the aid of the few remaining ring-bearers, Jordan is eventually captured while his ring is drained and enslaved by the Manhunters on a planet that is revealed to be Oa. He discovers the presumed destroyed Central Power Battery, and is able to rally the bearers of all surviving power rings to join him in rescuing the Battery and freeing the slaves. With the Battery restored and the power rings&#39; full powers unlocked, the Green Lantern Corps is revived under the leadership of [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]]. Hal returns to Earth and reveals his identity as a Green Lantern to his Captain, Amy Seaton.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Earth One Volume 1&#39;&#39;.
