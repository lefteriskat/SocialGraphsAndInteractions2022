It was produced by [[Warner Bros.

The show is said to explore the darker side of many Batman projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal relations, fear of the unknown, as well as [[cyberpunk]] and [[sci-fi]] themes such as the issues and dilemmas of innovation and technological and scientific progress affecting society, and the psychology of the character of Bruce Wayne. In addition, due to the titular character being a high school student, it includes issues that plague teenagers (substance abuse, subcultures, child abuse and neglect, school violence, peer pressure, etc.). As such, it was considerably darker than most other children&#39;s programs at the time, although producer [[Bruce Timm]] recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; cartoon.&lt;ref name=\&quot;mmv3\&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm |last= Nolen-Weathington |first= Eric |date= June 1, 2004 |publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |isbn= 978-1-893905-30-6 |page= 67 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EMwn_4llWK0C&amp;q=Bruce+Timm+kid-friendly+Batman+Beyond+cartoon&amp;pg=PA67 |access-date= July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; series to portray the hero as a teenager. &#39;&#39;[[IGN]]&#39;&#39; named the show 40th on their list of \&quot;Top 100 Animated TV Series.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;ign\&quot;/&gt; The premise of &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; has been used in [[Batman Beyond (comics)|various comic book stories]] published by DC Comics, including an ongoing series beginning in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Batman Beyond episodes}}\nThe story begins in the year 2019 (20 years following &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[The New Batman Adventures]]&#39;&#39; and 15 to 17 years following &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;) [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], despite being past his prime and in his mid- to late 50s, continues to fight crime as Batman in a new high-tech [[Batsuit]]. In the rescue of a kidnapped heiress and daughter of an [[List of DC Animated Universe characters#Veronica Vreeland|old socialite friend]] of his, he suffers a mild heart attack and, at risk of being beaten to death by one of the kidnappers, is forced to betray a lifelong principle and his paramount rule by threatening the criminals with a gun, the same kind of weapon that murdered his parents and drove him to become Batman in the first place. Bruce is ashamed and, fearing that he eventually will surrender to his murderous temptation if continuing crime-fighting, decides to retire from being Batman for good and by this point in his life, his butler, father figure and close confidant [[Alfred Pennyworth]] as well as close allies [[Commissioner James Gordon]], [[Dr. Leslie Thompkins]], [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Hamilton Hill]], [[Harvey Bullock (character)|Harvey Bullock]], [[Renee Montoya]], [[Lucius Fox]] and [[Summer Gleeson]] have all either retired or died of natural causes. His crime-fighting partners [[Dick Grayson]], [[Barbara Gordon]], [[Tim Drake]] and [[Selina Kyle]] are still alive and are now estranged from him following their retirements from their alter-egos and possible falling outs with him. His [[List of Batman family enemies|rogues&#39; gallery]], consisting of [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Two-Face]], [[Riddler]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], [[Man-Bat]], [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Clayface]], [[Ra&#39;s al Ghul]] and his daughter [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]], [[Andrea Beaumont|Phantasm]], [[Ventriloquist (character)|Ventriloquist]], [[Scarface (comics)|Scarface]], [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Hugo Strange]], [[Rupert Thorne]], [[Deadshot]], [[Baby-Doll (character)|Baby-Doll]] and [[Killer Croc]] are all either in prison, exile, have disappeared or are dead. He has also severed his ties with and resigned from the [[Justice League]].\n\nThe story moves ahead 20 years later to 2039 in [[Gotham City|Neo-Gotham]], a futuristic version of Gotham City, a [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] featuring staggering high rises and flying vehicles driven by [[upper class]] society. Bruce is now a man in his 70s, living in bitter isolation in [[Wayne Manor]], with no other companion but his guard dog [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]. It is implied by his virtue of continuing to fight crime for as long as possible and ignoring his aging and deteriorating health (he had retained his former partner&#39;s costumes) that he had suffered a tragic event years prior to his retirement, which is revealed in &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39;. [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] is an athletic 16-year-old high school student and reformed troublemaker with a deeply ingrained sense of personal justice. Living on difficult terms with his father Warren McGinnis, Terry disobeys his curfew one night to meet up with his girlfriend Dana Tan, only to be harassed by a gang called the [[Jokerz]]. A high-speed motorcycle chase between him and the Jokerz ends in the grounds of Wayne Manor, where they run into the elderly Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the gang side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates Bruce&#39;s heart condition. Terry helps him back to the manor and, while exploring the mansion, stumbles upon the entrance to the Batcave and thus discovers Bruce&#39;s secrets, only to be chased out by an angered Bruce.\n\nTerry returns home to discover that his father has been murdered, apparently by the vengeful Jokerz. Soon after, though, he discovers that his father had stumbled onto information about the production of [[Biological warfare|illegal chemical weapons]] by [[Derek Powers]] through [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne-Powers]] (Wayne Enterprises had merged with Powers&#39; company long ago around the time of and following Bruce&#39;s retirement as Batman) and that the man actually responsible for his father&#39;s murder is Powers&#39; personal assistant/bodyguard Mr. Fixx. Terry goes to Bruce who tells Terry to take the evidence to Barbara Gordon, the current Police Commissioner. After the evidence of the illegal weapon production is forcibly taken from Terry by Derek Powers, Terry subsequently steals the Batsuit, intending to bring Powers to justice. Bruce initially opposes all of Terry&#39;s efforts and demands that he return the suit, but Terry convinces Bruce to let him take on the Batman mantle and subsequently defeats Mr. Fixx. During the battle, Powers is exposed to the chemical and forced to flee into hiding to receive treatment, which subsequently mutates him into a radiation-emitting entity, though he uses artificial skin to hide the accident. Realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in Gotham without Batman&#39;s presence, Bruce offers Terry the chance to assume the role of Batman, with Bruce himself mentoring Terry and in addition to working as Bruce&#39;s chauffeur and assistant so that Terry can support his family.\n\nThe new Batman soon develops his own rogues gallery, with both new villains (the radiation-emitting metahuman Blight (a.k.a. Derek Powers); seductive shapeshifter [[Inque]]; hypnotist the [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]]; [[Sonic weapon|sound weaponizer]] Shriek; deadly assassin Curar\u00e9; insane eco-terrorist Mad Stan; cybernetically enhanced African [[big-game hunter]] the Stalker; nerdy [[psychokinetic]] Willie Watt and a new version of the [[Royal Flush Gang]] as well as some of his mentor&#39;s old foes, such as a rejuvenated [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], the [[longevity|longevous]] [[Ra&#39;s al Ghul]], and even the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] himself.\n\nTerry also makes allies in Neo-Gotham, including computer [[genius]] [[Maxine \&quot;Max\&quot; Gibson]]. After discovering Batman&#39;s secret identity, she helps him with everything from [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]] to [[babysitting]]. Police Commissioner Barbara Gordon also works with Terry. Though initially unhappy about another person following in Bruce&#39;s dangerous footsteps and at first vehemently opposed to his efforts to help, she admits that the city needs Batman. He also has a relationship with Melanie Walker, who was forced to do the bidding of her family, the new Royal Flush Gang, under the codename Ten. Terry would also later encounter [[Superman]] and the Justice League and help them fight an [[Starro|alien threat]] although he would not join the group until adulthood where he presumably like his mentor before him also operates as a part-timer. \n\nIn the episode \&quot;Epilogue\&quot; (the second season finale of &#39;&#39;Justice League Unlimited&#39;&#39; but a conclusion to &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;), Terry in his 30s learns that Bruce Wayne is his biological father. Upon questioning Wayne&#39;s old enemy-turned-ally [[Amanda Waller]], she reveals to him that she spearheaded \&quot;Project: Batman Beyond\&quot; to create a successor upon realising the possibility of Bruce&#39;s eventual retirement or death as he got older and that a world always needed a Batman and his unique skillset. While this revelation supposedly strained Bruce and Terry&#39;s relationship he eventually makes peace with it and resumes his duty as Batman.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Batman Beyond characters|List of DC Animated Universe characters}}\n* [[Will Friedle]] as [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis / Batman]]:&lt;br /&gt;The second Batman, he is a high school student and former delinquent. Under the pretense of doing errands for Bruce, Terry fights crime as the new Batman. Terry was chosen to be the new Dark Knight as he shared a similar loss as Bruce had; that being the death of a parent.\n*\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]: &lt;br /&gt;The original Batman, although initially reluctant he later becomes Terry&#39;s employer, mentor, and predecessor who guides Terry through the Batcomputer but also occasionally ventures into the field to help his successor if the situation demands it, despite the risks associated with his age. During his final mission as the Dark Knight twenty years prior to the events of the main story, Bruce suffered a [[heart attack]] that nearly cost him his life, forcing him to break his primary moral principle by threatening to kill a criminal with a gun in self-defense. Abhorred that he nearly used the type of weapon that took his parents&#39; ([[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne|Martha]]) lives and the very thing that drove him to become a vigilante, and afraid of what he might do next, Wayne reluctantly hung up his cape and cowl.\n* [[Cree Summer]] as Maxine \&quot;Max\&quot; Gibson:&lt;br /&gt; A genius high schooler and friend of Terry&#39;s. She discovers his secret identity, and from then on occasionally helps Batman in an \&quot;[[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]\&quot;-type role, though she is considered a nuisance to his predecessor (but less so as time went on). Her parents are divorced and she has an unnamed sister.\n*[[Lauren Tom]] as Dana Tan: &lt;br /&gt;Terry&#39;s on and off girlfriend in high school who is initially and formerly unaware of his secret identity as the new Dark Knight, and thus surprised or upset by his frequent absences which she only knows due to him working as a personal assistant for Bruce Wayne, to support his family financially following his father&#39;s death. She also has a father who is disapproving of Terry because of the latter&#39;s past as an irresponsible delinquent, which serves as a reminder and another motivation for Terry being Batman.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]:&lt;br /&gt;Bruce Wayne&#39;s pet dog and his sole companion in Wayne Manor, the billionaire rescued and took in the stray [[Great Dane]] after the canine defended him from a [[Jokerz]] thug during one of Wayne&#39;s annual visits in memory of his parents to [[Crime Alley]]. Fiercely loyal to Bruce, he eventually develops a bond with Terry as well.\n* [[Stockard Channing]] (1999\u20132000) and [[Angie Harmon]] (2000) as [[Barbara Gordon]]: &lt;br /&gt;The new Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department, having succeeded her father [[Jim Gordon (character)|Jim]] and one of Bruce&#39;s former crime-fighting partners, Batgirl and was at one point in her younger years romantically involved with him which ended badly. Unlike her father, Barbara initially has a rocky relationship with the new Batman, showing resentment towards Bruce for dragging him into this life and is at first against him intervening in police duty. Though this is revealed to have been due to a long standing grudge towards Bruce for how he treated his former partners and also because of what happened years ago, [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|the night the Bat-family splintered]] as she later gains respect for Terry after he helps her in several sticky situations and begins acknowledging his help whenever needed, though does not use a [[Bat-Signal]] unlike her father, presumably because she has direct access to the Batcave from the office and because of her past as Batgirl. She is married to Sam Young, the District Attorney of Neo-Gotham.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Batman Beyond episodes}}\n{{:List of Batman Beyond episodes}}\n\n===Crossovers===\nThe third season of &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; featured the two-part episode \&quot;The Call\&quot; with (for the first time) a futuristic [[Justice League]], a [[springboard]] for the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; animated series. The setting and characters of &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; were also briefly revived in &#39;&#39;[[Static Shock]]&#39;&#39; during the episode \&quot;[[Future Shock (Static Shock)|Future Shock]]\&quot; in which [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is accidentally transported 40 years into the future.\n\n&#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; revisited the &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; world twice in 2005. The first was in \&quot;[[The Once and Future Thing]]\&quot; (Part 2), which featured [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] transported 50 years into the future to stop a [[Chronos (character)|time-travelling villain]] with the help of the future Justice League (Batman II, Static and Warhawk).\n\nThe second time was meant to be the de facto [[series finale]] for &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;: the episode \&quot;[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]\&quot; reveals that Bruce Wayne is actually Terry McGinnis&#39;s biological father. The story, set 15 years after &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;, centers on Terry (now in his early 30s) tracking down an elderly [[Amanda Waller]]. She explains through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] that, even though she grew to trust and respect Batman, she was aware of him aging, thus accepting the idea of either Bruce retiring or being killed at some point. Finding the idea of a world without Batman unacceptable, Waller used her [[Project Cadmus]] connections to gather the technology for \&quot;Project Batman Beyond\&quot;, whose goal was to physically create a new Batman, starting with a secretly collected sample of Bruce Wayne&#39;s DNA. Some years after Bruce retired, Waller found a young Neo-Gotham couple\u2014the McGinnises\u2014with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce&#39;s parents, a [[Nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution was injected into Warren McGinnis to rewrite his [[Reproduction|reproductive]] material with that of Bruce. The eventual result was his wife Mary McGinnis giving birth to Terry, a child sharing the genetic traits of his mother and Bruce Wayne. When Terry was eight years old, Waller employed an elderly Andrea Beaumont in her [[Andrea Beaumont|Phantasm]] alias as an assassin to kill Terry&#39;s family, hoping the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, Beaumont could not commit the act, arguing that she would be doing something against what Bruce stood for. Waller eventually conceded that Beaumont had been right and abolished the project altogether. Eight years afterward, Warren would be murdered, and Terry would meet Bruce by happenstance\u2014resulting in Terry becoming Batman&#39;s successor. Waller concludes by reminding Terry that he is Bruce&#39;s son, not his clone, and that, despite the circumstances of his existence, he still has [[free will]] to live out his own life; Terry comes to terms with his revelations, and continues in being Batman. With a new sense of purpose, Terry plans to propose to Dana, while continuing his life of crimefighting.\n\n===Animation===\nIn order to complete the series, Warner Bros. Animation outsourced &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; to [[Dong Yang Animation]], [[CNK International|Koko Enterprises]] and Seoul Movie (a subsidiary of TMS) in Seoul, South Korea. While the South Korean studios animated the series&#39; episodes, the feature film &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39; was animated by [[TMS Entertainment]] in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n==Spinoff==\n{{main|The Zeta Project}}\nA spinoff from &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;, an animated series called &#39;&#39;[[The Zeta Project]]&#39;&#39;, featured a revamped version of the [[synthoid]] Zeta from the &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Zeta\&quot;.
