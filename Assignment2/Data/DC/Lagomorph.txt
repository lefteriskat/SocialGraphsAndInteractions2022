Created by writer [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and artist [[Joe Orlando]], the team premiered in the [[DC Comics]] title &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #62 (May-June 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 117 |quote = Writer E.

The first 10 had new material and were published from 1967 to 1968.&lt;ref name=Chron/&gt;\n\nIssues #11 and 12 were published in 1972, and titled &#39;&#39;Inferior 5&#39;&#39; (using the number 5 rather than spelling out the word) and were all reprints, except for the covers. Nothing changed with the alteration of the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/inferior.htm |title=The Inferior Five}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Pre-Crisis ===\nThe team has appeared only sporadically after their series was canceled, with &#39;&#39;Showcase&#39;&#39; #100 being their only new appearance during the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eury|first=Michael|date=July 2013|title=Back Seat Driver|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#65| page=2|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other appearances include one or two panels (there is disagreement over whether the characters in one panel are the Inferior Five) in &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!|Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz\u2013Wonderland War]]&#39;&#39; #3 (March 1986), and the [[Grant Morrison]]-written &#39;&#39;[[Animal Man (comic book)|Animal Man]]&#39;&#39; series. They appear in one panel in &#39;&#39;[[JLA: Another Nail]]&#39;&#39; as Flash and the Atom take a trip through many dimensions.\n\nAlthough the Inferior Five&#39;s original stories made frequent references to other prominent DC heroes, &#39;&#39;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz\u2013Wonderland War&#39;&#39; #3 revealed their adventures to have occurred on \&quot;Earth-Twelve\&quot;, which had its own doppelgangers of the JLA, the Teen Titans, etc., meaning that any such references were out of continuity in relation to the heroes of DC&#39;s primary Earth-One.\n\n=== Post-Crisis ===\nFollowing &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, where the Five were seen in background cameos, the team&#39;s sole \&quot;continuity\&quot; appearance as a team was in the 1991 &#39;&#39;[[Angel and the Ape]]&#39;&#39; miniseries, where it was revealed that Angel and the Dumb Bunny are half-sisters. Members of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] had cameos in the series, indicating that the Inferior Five now existed on the Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth.\n\nThe Inferior Five appear in issue #17 of the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; comics. The Inferior Five team up with the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]] in &#39;&#39;The Brave and The Bold&#39;&#39; #35 and with [[Bat-Mite]] in &#39;&#39;Bat-Mite&#39;&#39; #5 (Dec. 2015).\n\n[[Steve Gerber]] proposed a [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] version of the Inferior Five as a send-up of the \&quot;dark &#39;n&#39; gritty\&quot; comics of the period, but this was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Nevada (comics)|Nevada]]&#39;&#39; #1 text page&lt;/ref&gt; Gerber later claimed that DC refused to publish anything with the title on the grounds that it would make them look \&quot;inferior\&quot; for publishing it.{{fact|date=March 2021}}\n\n=== 2019 mini-series ===\nIn September 2019, a 12-issue maxi-series by [[Keith Giffen]] was initiated. It was a reinvention of the team, as the protagonists are now five children in the small town of Dangerfield, Arizona. It revolves around a mystery regarding their parents, and they are the only ones that notice something strange is going on. It takes place in where the [[Invasion (DC Comics)|invasion]] was successful on the town of Dangerfield. The aliens are in hiding, still experimenting with the metagene, and keeping a focus on the five kids. The book later reveals that the Invasion is metafictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnston |first1=Rich |title=Keith Giffen Revives Inferior Five for DC Comics in September \u2013 What to Do With Woody Allen? |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/06/14/keith-giffen-revives-inferior-five-dc-comics-september-woody-allen/ |website=Bleeding Cool |access-date=31 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Sam |title=Inferior Five Enter DC&#39;s Rebirth Era Thanks To Keith Giffen, Jeff Lemire |url=https://www.cbr.com/inferior-five-dc-rebirth-keith-giffen-jeff-lemire/ |website=CBR |access-date=31 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also contains a backup feature starring Peacemaker. The number of issues was soon reduced from 12 to 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GCD::Series::Inferior Five |url=https://www.comics.org/series/150373/ |website=Grand Comics Database |access-date=6 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a fifteen month publishing hiatus between issues #4 (December 2019) and #5 (March 2021) with the last two issues released digitally.\n\n==Members==\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Merryman&#39;&#39;&#39; (Myron Victor, occupation: comic strip artist), a \&quot;98 Pound Weakling\&quot;, he is the son of the Patriot and Lady Liberty (parodying [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] and Quality Comics&#39; [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]]) and a descendant of Yellowjacket and the Crimson Chrysanthemum (obvious takeoffs on [[the Green Hornet]] and the [[Scarlet Pimpernel]]). The team&#39;s leader, he wears a [[jester]] outfit, having decided in the team&#39;s first appearance that if he was going to make a fool of himself, he might as well look the part. He is highly intelligent, making him the only team member who is thoroughly aware of the team&#39;s disadvantages. Although trained in the martial arts, he is physically a weakling with little practical ability to use such skills. He returned in &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39; as coordinator of the residents of Limbo,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Crisis Superman Beyond 3D&#39;&#39; #1\u20132 (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; leading them in assisting the [[Alternative versions of Superman|Supermen of the multiverse]] to fend off an attack from Mandrakk the Dark [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]], causing Superman to reflect that anyone could be a hero.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Awkwardman&#39;&#39;&#39; (Leander Brent, occupation: beachcomber), son of Mr. Might (parodying [[Superman]]) and the Mermaid (parodying [[Aquaman]]). He is super-strong and able to live underwater, having inherited powers from both parents, but is also very clumsy. In keeping with his half-undersea heritage, he requires periodic contact with water, which can consist of simply pouring it over himself with a watering can. His codename is a pun on &#39;&#39;Aquaman&#39;&#39;; his surname \&quot;Brent\&quot; rhymes with Superman&#39;s surname of \&quot;Kent\&quot;.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;The Blimp&#39;&#39;&#39; (Herman Cramer, occupation: diner owner), the obese son of Captain Swift (parodying the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]) who could fly but, as he lacked his father&#39;s speed powers, could only fly at super slow speeds \u2014 with a tail wind. He was one of the few superheroes to attend the funeral of [[Booster Gold]].\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;White Feather&#39;&#39;&#39; (William King, occupation: photographer), son of The Bowman (parodying [[Green Arrow]]) and an unidentified woman. He was a superb archer when he did not think anyone was watching; people made him nervous (as did just about everything else). His surname \&quot;King\&quot; parallels Green Arrow&#39;s surname \&quot;Queen\&quot;, and his codename is a reference to the [[white feather|traditional symbol of cowardice]].\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;The Dumb Bunny&#39;&#39;&#39; (Athena Tremor, occupation: model), the stupid but super-strong daughter of Princess Power (parodying [[Wonder Woman]]) and Steve Tremor (parodying [[Steve Trevor]]). In later continuity (revealed in &#39;&#39;[[Angel and the Ape]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1), she is still the daughter of Princess Power; it is later revealed that her father is actually Professor Theo O&#39;Day. Shortly after Athena&#39;s birth, Professor O&#39;Day left Princess Power and fell in love with a non-powered woman. Together, they had a daughter, Angel Beatrix O&#39;Day (who is Athena&#39;s half-sister). After Angel&#39;s mother died, Professor O&#39;Day reconciled with Princess Power and raised Athena and Angel together. As the Dumb Bunny, Athena is described as \&quot;strong as an ox and almost as intelligent\&quot;. She is named after the Greek goddess of wisdom, [[Athena]]. Although her surname \&quot;Tremor\&quot; is still given in current continuity, she is the daughter of Professor O&#39;Day instead of Steve Tremor. According to the end of &#39;&#39;The Brave and The Bold&#39;&#39; #35, Dumb Bunny actually appears to be extremely intelligent, as she clearly understands a scientist and explains it to the other people. Since her father is a professor, the \&quot;Dumb\&quot; role play may be her \&quot;trick\&quot; and also not wanting to overshadow \&quot;Merryman\&quot;.\n\n==Superior Five==\nIn the miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Villains United]]&#39;&#39;, the Inferior Five were paid homage as a group of supervillains who are tentatively known as the Superior Five. Each member has the abilities of an I5 member but, aside from being evil, are serious and modern-styled characters. They consist of:\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Tremor&#39;&#39;&#39; (Awkwardman)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Hindenburg&#39;&#39;&#39; (the Blimp)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Splitshot&#39;&#39;&#39; (White Feather)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Lagomorph&#39;&#39;&#39; (the Dumb Bunny)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Jongleur&#39;&#39;&#39; (Merryman)\n\nLittle has been seen of these characters except for one panel in &#39;&#39;Villains United&#39;&#39; #4 and a few shots of them in the background in the same issue. They are among the imprisoned supervillains in &#39;&#39;[[Salvation Run]]&#39;&#39;. Jongleur is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The teams Inferior Five, [[Metal Men]], [[The Trenchcoat Brigade]], [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Monster Society of Evil]], and Tornado Twins appear in the background in the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Mayhem of the Music Meister!\&quot;.\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe Inferior Five are among many other DC characters included in &#39;&#39;[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=DC Characters and Objects - Scribblenauts Unmasked Wiki Guide - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/wikis/scribblenauts-unmasked/DC_Characters_and_Objects|language=en|access-date=2019-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Awards==\nThe series and characters have been recognized in the field, being awarded a 1966 [[Alley Award]] for Best Humor Title: Costumed.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*DC page: [http://www.dccomics.com/comics/inferior-five-2019 IF2019]\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/inferior.htm Inferior Five] at [[Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia]].
