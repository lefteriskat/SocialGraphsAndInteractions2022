It features the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. The film is based on &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; and is the first original theatrical film produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], the first film in the [[DC Animated Universe]] and the only one released theatrically.{{efn|&#39;&#39;[[Batman and Harley Quinn]]&#39;&#39; had a limited theatrical release in 2017.}} [[Kevin Conroy]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]], [[Bob Hastings]] and [[Robert Costanzo]] reprise their roles from &#39;&#39;The Animated Series&#39;&#39;, joined by [[Dana Delany]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Stacy Keach|Stacy Keach Jr.]], [[Abe Vigoda]], [[Dick Miller]] and [[John P. Ryan]]. As the events of the film take place between the first and second seasons of &#39;&#39;Batman: The Animated Series&#39;&#39;, its story follows Batman as he reconciles with a former lover, [[Andrea Beaumont]], and faces a mysterious vigilante who is murdering [[Gotham City]]&#39;s crime bosses. The plot was inspired by [[Mike W. Barr]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Year Two]]&#39;&#39; comic book [[story arc]], but features an original antagonist, the Phantasm, in place of the [[Reaper (DC Comics)|Reaper]], while also borrowing elements from the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Year One]]&#39;&#39; graphic novel, recounting how Bruce Wayne became Batman and his first attempts to fight crime.\n\nOriginally planned for a [[direct-to-video]] release, [[Warner Bros.]] gave &#39;&#39;Mask of the Phantasm&#39;&#39; a theatrical release, condensing its production into a strenuous eight-month schedule. The film was the first theatrical feature film produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], and was released through the studio&#39;s [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]]&lt;ref name=\&quot;afi\&quot; /&gt; division on December 25, 1993, to positive reviews from critics, who praised the stylized animation, voice performances, story, and music. In the years since its release, &#39;&#39;Mask of the Phantasm&#39;&#39; has continued to receive acclaim. In 2011, &#39;&#39;[[Time (magazine)|Time]]&#39;&#39; ranked it as one of the 10 best superhero films ever. In 2017, [[Screen Rant]] named the film the best &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; movie of all time. In 2018, &#39;&#39;[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]&#39;&#39; magazine called the film \&quot;the greatest &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; movie\&quot;. In 2022, &#39;&#39;[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]&#39;&#39; magazine named it the best &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; film. Also in 2022, nearly 30 years after its release, &#39;&#39;[[Rolling Stone]]&#39;&#39; placed &#39;&#39;Mask of the Phantasm&#39;&#39; at number 19 on its list of the 50 Greatest Superhero Movies of All Time, being the only [[Traditional animation|traditionally-animated]] film included, the third-best animated superhero film and the second-best &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; film of all time, behind only &#39;&#39;[[The Dark Knight]]&#39;&#39; (number 8).&lt;!--sourced in Legacy section--&gt;\n\nDue to the decision to release it in theaters on short notice, &#39;&#39;Mask of the Phantasm&#39;&#39; [[Box office bomb|failed at the box office]]. After its release on home media, it became financially successful. Its success led to direct-to-video sequels, &#39;&#39;[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]&#39;&#39; (1998) and &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]&#39;&#39; (2003). Until the limited release of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]&#39;&#39; in 2016, &#39;&#39;Mask of the Phantasm&#39;&#39; was the only animated &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; film to be given a theatrical release, as well as the only one to receive a full theatrical release until &#39;&#39;[[The Lego Batman Movie]]&#39;&#39; in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n&lt;!-- The film is presented in a non-linear narrative. This plot synopsis is written chronologically. --&gt;\n\nAfter meeting while visiting their parents&#39; graves at Gotham Cemetery, a young Bruce Wayne and [[Andrea Beaumont]] begin a relationship. At the same time Bruce makes his first attempts at crime-fighting, but while he succeeds in foiling robberies he is discouraged that the criminals do not fear him. Bruce becomes conflicted about whether to commit to his relationship with Andrea or defend [[Gotham City]] to avenge his parents, but eventually proposes marriage. Andrea accepts, only to mysteriously leave Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont, ending the engagement in a [[Dear John letter]]. Heartbroken, Bruce assumes the mantle of [[Batman]].\n\nTen years later, Batman breaks up a meeting of Gotham [[Organized crime|crime bosses]] led by Chuckie Sol. When Sol tries to escape in his car, he is killed by a cloaked figure, the \&quot;Phantasm\&quot;, who causes him to speed out of control and fatally crash into a building. Batman is witnessed at the scene and it is believed he killed Sol, with city councilman Arthur Reeves, who is corrupt and on the mob&#39;s payroll, vowing to have him arrested. \n\nThe Phantasm murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in the Gotham Cemetery, where Bronski&#39;s bodyguards see Phantasm and mistake him for Batman. Batman investigates the scene of Bronski&#39;s death and encounters Andrea, inadvertently revealing his identity to her. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster, Salvatore Valestra, later finding a photograph of the four together in Valestra&#39;s home. Paranoid that Batman will come for him next, the now-elderly Valestra asks Reeves for help, but is refused. In desperation, he turns to the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].\n\nThe Phantasm goes to kill Valestra at his mansion, only to find him dead from exposure to Joker&#39;s venom. Seeing Phantasm through a camera, Joker realizes Batman is not the murderer and detonates a bomb he planted in the mansion. Phantasm escapes the blast and is pursued by Batman but disappears, leaving Batman ambushed by the police but saved from arrest by Andrea. She explains to Bruce her father [[embezzlement|embezzled]] money from Valestra and was forced to repay it; Valestra then demanded he pay more and put a [[Contract killing|hit]] on Carl, prompting him to go into hiding with Andrea. Together once again, the two consider resuming their relationship. Bruce believes Carl Beaumont to be the Phantasm until he takes another look at the photo with him and Valestra, recognizing one of Valestra&#39;s men as the Joker.\n\nBelieving him to be behind the Phantasm in order to erase his mob connections, Joker presses Reeves for information before poisoning him with venom. Driven insane, Reeves is taken to the hospital, where Batman interrogates him. Reeves, who worked as Carl&#39;s accountant before going into politics, confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape but told Valestra their location in exchange for the funding needed to launch his first campaign. Both Batman and Joker deduce that the Phantasm is Andrea, who intends to wipe out the Valestra mob for killing her father and ruining her chance to marry Bruce.\n\nAndrea tracks down Joker, her father&#39;s killer, to his hideout in Gotham&#39;s abandoned World&#39;s Fair. They fight but are interrupted by Batman, who begs Andrea to stop, to no avail. Joker prepares to blow up the fair but is seized by Andrea, who bids Batman goodbye; having barely survived the blast, Batman finds no trace of either Andrea or the Joker. Bruce is later consoled by [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] in the [[Batcave]], who assures him Andrea could not have been helped, before finding Andrea&#39;s locket containing a picture of them together. A sorrowful Andrea departs Gotham and a saddened Batman, cleared of the accusations against him, resumes crimefighting.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] \n* [[Dana Delany]] as [[Andrea Beaumont|Andrea Beaumont / The Phantasm]]&lt;br/&gt; [[Stacy Keach]] (who also voices Carl Beaumont) provided the voice for The Phantasm while masked. \n* [[Hart Bochner]] as Arthur Reeves \n* Stacy Keach as Carl Beaumont \n* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Sal \&quot;The Wheezer\&quot; Valestra\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Chuckie Sol\n* [[John P.

The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at [[Arkham Asylum]] and face a [[kangaroo court]] in which the villains try him for making them what they are. The idea&#39;s concept, however, was considered \&quot;too brainy\&quot;, as it required Batman to be immobile for a long time, so the idea was later used in the series&#39; episode \&quot;Trial\&quot;, which was aired after the film&#39;s release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/batman-mask-of-the-phantasm-animated-movie-facts-trivia/|title=15 Things You Didn&#39;t Know About Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm|date=February 1, 2017|website=[[Screen Rant]]|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett&#39;s intention to tell a story far removed from the television series&#39; regular [[rogues gallery]]. Burnett also cited he \&quot;wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show.

According to Burnett, the Phantasm was like the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] with a cape, although the idea was to make him resemble the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] of [[Charles Dickens]]&#39; novel &#39;&#39;[[A Christmas Carol]]&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydv8TS2wids| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211115/Ydv8TS2wids| archive-date=2021-11-15 | url-status=live|title=The Making Of Batman Mask of The Phantasm|last=Living Abstraction|date=September 11, 2015|access-date=June 4, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that even the Joker mentions in the finished version of the film. \n{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote=\&quot;It was basically an expanded episode.
