Created by [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]] and [[C. C. Beck]], the character is a recurring enemy of the [[superhero]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel/Shazam]], both of whom first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Whiz Comics]]&#39;&#39; #2 ([[cover date|cover-dated]] February 1940) by [[Fawcett Comics]].&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mad scientist]] and inventor bent on world domination, Sivana was soon established as Captain Marvel&#39;s main [[archenemy]] during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]], appearing in over half of the Fawcett &#39;&#39;Captain Marvel&#39;&#39; stories published between 1939 and 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Shazam!: Who is Doctor Sivana? |url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2019/04/03/shazam-who-is-doctor-sivana |date=2019-04-03 |website=DC |language=en |access-date=2020-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSivana has kept his role as one of the key archenemies of Captain Marvel, now also known as Shazam, through to the character&#39;s appearances in DC Comics, which eventually acquired the rights to Fawcett&#39;s superhero characters. In 2009, Doctor Sivana was ranked as [[IGN]]&#39;s 82nd-greatest comic book villain of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/82.html Doctor Sivana is number 82] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509065254/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/82.html |date=May 9, 2009 }} [[IGN]].

(film)|Shazam!]]&#39;&#39;, portrayed by [[Mark Strong]].\n\n==Publication history==\n===Fawcett Comics and pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; DC Comics===\nInfamously evil, Doctor Sivana appeared in well over half of all of the Golden Age Captain Marvel comic stories, and in all of the first four stories, after having deduced Captain Marvel&#39;s dual identity as boy radio broadcaster Billy Batson early on. Depicted as a brilliant, if evil, scientist, Sivana used all manner of unusual inventions and techniques against the Marvels. He was at first a good man who wanted to help humanity, but big business, bosses, and other concerns blocked and checked him and even called him mad, until, embittered, he turned against humanity and moved to Venus. He somehow held high status among the beings of the planet Venus.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Whiz Comics&#39;&#39; #15, (March 21, 1941)&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Earth, establishing himself as a villain, and clashed with Capt. Marvel in the latter&#39;s first fight. Along with the Marvel Family, Sivana entered publishing limbo in 1953, following a ruling in the &#39;&#39;[[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications]]&#39;&#39; court case finding that Captain Marvel was an illegal infringement of [[Superman]].\n\nNational Comics (today [[DC Comics]]) acquired the rights to the Captain Marvel characters in 1972, relaunching them in a new title, &#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; the following February. The characters&#39; 20-year absence from publication was explained as the result of Doctor Sivana and the Sivana Family having trapped the Marvels, their friends, other superheroes, and, by accident, themselves in a sphere of Suspendium, due to Sivana Jr. distracting Doctor Sivana by slapping him on the back in congratulation and making him crash the spaceship into the Suspendium sphere, a compound that kept them in suspended animation from 1953 until 1973. They were released when the Suspendium sphere neared the sun, melting it enough that Captain Marvel was revived. He and the other Marvels then pushed it back to Earth. The Sivanas escaped in their spaceship but were captured by Captain Marvel in the same issue despite another attempt at world domination. He still makes many attempts at world domination, including a multi-issue storyline where he traveled across America, threatening to destroy entire cities unless he was acknowledged as Rightful Ruler of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; #25\u201329&lt;/ref&gt; In &#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; #28 (1977) he was responsible for bringing [[Black Adam]] back using his reincarnation machine.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Shazam! The New Beginning&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Power of Shazam!&#39;&#39;===\nSivana continued to appear in &#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39;-related stories through the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; limited series in 1985. He was reintroduced by Roy Thomas and Tom Mandrake in the miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Shazam!: The New Beginning]]&#39;&#39; in 1987. This Sivana was the same mad scientist that the previous one had been, except that he only had two children (Beautia and Magnificus), and was Billy Batson&#39;s step-uncle.\n\n[[Jerry Ordway]] revised the character of Sivana for his 1994 graphic novel &#39;&#39;[[The Power of Shazam!]]&#39;&#39; and the resulting ongoing series, and this revision has been retained in all following DC publications. The modern Sivana, in addition to being a mad scientist, was also a powerful and influential tycoon (&#39;&#39;a la&#39;&#39; [[Lex Luthor]] of the &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; comics). The former [[CEO]] of his own Sivana Industries, Sivana&#39;s corrupted dealings and crossing of Captain Marvel led to his own destruction and his intense hatred of the Marvel Family. Beautia and Magnificus Sivana are reintroduced again in this series; their mother, Sivana&#39;s ex-wife Venus, is briefly seen in &#39;&#39;The Power of Shazam!&#39;&#39; #27.\n\n===Later appearances===\nAfter &#39;&#39;The Power of Shazam!&#39;&#39; series ended in 1999, Sivana was rarely seen until &#39;&#39;[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #13\u201315 (August\u2013October 2004), in which he reorganizes the supervillain group the [[Fearsome Five]], appointing himself leader. Sivana and his four associates [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]], [[Psimon]], [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]], and [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]] (a fifth, [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]], is killed by Sivana for challenging the scientist&#39;s position as resident genius) continued to appear at irregular intervals in the pages of &#39;&#39;Outsiders&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-fear\&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert| contribution = Fearsome Five | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 120 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Pre-Crisis===\nSivana is a short, bald, self-described [[mad scientist]] with a penchant for developing unusual technologies. He often plots to do away with [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and his [[Marvel Family]], but is usually thwarted in his plans. His trademark phrases are \&quot;Curses! Foiled again!\&quot; and his mocking laughter \&quot;Heh! Heh! Heh!\&quot; He also coined the insulting name Big Red Cheese to refer to Captain Marvel, a name that the Captain&#39;s friends have adopted with which to light-heartedly tease him.\n\n[[File:Sivanafamily.PNG|Sivana, with his children Sivana, Jr and Georgia.

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; born in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain Marvel Adventures&#39;&#39; #138 (November 1952). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; began with the best intentions and was one of [[Europe]]&#39;s best scientific minds, with progressive scientific ideas that could revolutionize industry but were rejected by everyone he approached. Laughed out of society by people who called his inventions impractical and his science a fake, Sivana took his family to the planet [[Venus]] in a spaceship he had invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he stayed until his children were grown, and Earth not so backward as when he left it. (Since his children were adults by 1940, his departure from Earth would implicitly have been the late 1910s or early 1920s.) During his years away, struggling to tame the Venusian jungle, Sivana turned bitter and planned his revenge against the world that had shunned him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Whiz Comics&#39;&#39; #15, (March 21, 1941). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He initially plotted his revenge with a radio silencer that would disable all radio communications permanently. He tried to extort $50 million, only to be stopped by Captain Marvel in his first adventure. Cap broke through the window of the building where Sivana was hiding and defeated the guards, binding them securely with tubing ripped from the radio-silencer.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Whiz Comics&#39;&#39; #2 (February 1940). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sivana planned to kill Captain Marvel with a blast from his Atom-Smasher, but Cap leaped back out the window and escaped. During the fight, Sivana&#39;s returning army angrily asked why Captain Marvel had defeated them in their war against America despite their highly advanced weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Whiz Comics&#39;&#39; #3A (March 1940). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sivana appeared to have been killed by the Atom-Smasher blast, but he returned a short time later, having somehow learned Captain Marvel&#39;s identity. He sent a letter to Billy Batson to lure him to the planet Venus, disguising himself as &#39;Professor Xerxes Smith&#39;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Whiz Comics&#39; 1940\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Whiz Comics&#39;&#39; #3B (April 1940). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sivana&#39;s henchmen bound and gagged Batson, and Sivana tried to take away his memory using a Memory Mangler. Billy regained his memory after stumbling into the cave of Shazam and accidentally saying the word \&quot;Shazam\&quot;. Sivana&#39;s henchmen rebelled against him and set off an explosion that destroyed the Mangler. Ironically, Captain Marvel saved Sivana and his daughter Beautia, who the henchmen had left to die.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Whiz Comics&#39;&#39; #4 (May 1940). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sivana continued to nurse a megalomaniacal grudge against humanity and also a personal enmity with the Marvel Family. This persisted even after Cap revealed Sivana&#39;s former benevolent inventions (which Sivana considered useless), leading to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]]. Far from being pleased, Sivana was insulted by the prize and stated that only when he was crowned Ruler of the Universe would he consider himself properly honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bridwell |first1=E. Nelson |last2=Newton |first2=Don |title=Sivana&#39;s Nobel! |journal=World&#39;s Finest Comics |date=November 1981 |volume= |issue=#273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Golden Age Sivana was a twice-widowed father with four children/ &#39;&#39;&#39;Sivana Family&#39;&#39;&#39;: good-natured adult daughter &#39;&#39;&#39;Beautia&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Whiz Comics&#39; 1940\&quot;/&gt; who, when first seen, was Empress of Venus. Beautia has bewitching beauty which affects men like a drug, which Sivana once used to try to make her win an election. Beautia&#39;s remaining siblings include the super-strong &#39;&#39;&#39;Magnificus&#39;&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Whiz Comics&#39;&#39; #15 (March 1941). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and evil teenagers &#39;&#39;&#39;Georgia&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mary Marvel Comics&#39;&#39; #1 (January 1946).

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Sivana Family,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Marvel Family&#39;&#39; #10 (April 1947). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sivana, Georgia, and Sivana Jr. attempted to destroy Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr., respectively. They traveled through time via the Rock of Eternity to various points in the history of Atlantis (ancient, modern, and future). There they attempted to steal technology to build a machine that would create a barrier around the Earth, thereby preventing the Marvels from calling down lightning. Georgia and Jr. possess brilliant minds like their father and share his enmity with the Marvel Family, but Magnificus and Beautia rarely fight the Marvels. In fact, Beautia has an unrequited crush on Captain Marvel, not realizing that he is really an adolescent boy.\n\n===Post-Crisis===\nFollowing the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; miniseries, Sivana was first reintroduced as Billy Batson&#39;s step-uncle in a 1987 miniseries, &#39;&#39;Shazam! The New Beginning&#39;&#39;. Magnificus and Beautia were depicted as his only children.\n\nA second retcon in 1994 established Sivana as a wealthy tycoon with political influence, similar to [[Lex Luthor]], only to have the events surrounding an archaeological expedition to Egypt he sponsored lead to both the creation of Captain Marvel and the fall of Sivana&#39;s fortunes. Blaming Captain Marvel for his fall from grace, Sivana dedicated himself wholeheartedly to using his inventions and intellect against the Marvel Family. In current continuity, Sivana&#39;s ex-wife Venus is still alive, as are all four Sivana children. They resemble their Pre-Crisis counterparts.\n\nThe evil scientist appears briefly in the \&quot;[[Infinite Crisis]]\&quot; storyline. Sivana also appeared along with Lex Luthor in the four-issue 2005 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] &#39;&#39;Superman/Shazam: First Thunder&#39;&#39; by [[Judd Winick]] and [[Joshua Middleton]], which depicts the first meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.\n\nIn the 2006\u20132007 limited series &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39;, Sivana was abducted to Oolong Island, a tropical paradise run by [[Intergang]], where he and many other DC Universe \&quot;mad scientists\&quot; are allowed to live a hedonistic lifestyle while creating the inventions of their wildest dreams and pitting them against one another. They create the Four Horsemen of the [[Apokolips]] and succeed in capturing [[Black Adam]], whom Sivana then tortures for weeks, until Adam is freed by heroes storming the island.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt; Georgia and Thaddeus Jr. were reintroduced in &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week Twenty-Six (November 1, 2006), in which they appear alongside Beautia, Magnificus, and their mother Venus, who wants Sivana found and has a charity dinner with the Black Marvel family.\n\nDr. Sivana turned out to be indirectly responsible for the main conflict of &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39;: disruptions in the fictional time stream caused by a mutated [[Mister Mind]]. Sivana had captured Mind, a [[worm]] who happened to be another of Captain Marvel&#39;s villains, and the scientist had bombarded it with treatments of Sivana&#39;s own \&quot;Suspendium\&quot; time-travel compound. As a result, Mr. Mind mutated (or, according to himself, matured\u2014as he had apparently been in larval form all this time) into a \&quot;hyperfly\&quot;, a (sometimes) planet-sized [[moth]]-like figure with the ability to travel in time and across realities, posing a serious threat to the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]. He is finally thrown back in time to the day where Dr. Sivana found him.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt;\n\nOn the cover of &#39;&#39;[[Justice League]] of America&#39;&#39; #13 vol. 2, it shows Doctor Sivana as a member of the new [[Injustice League]]. Doctor Sivana is one of the villains featured in &#39;&#39;[[Salvation Run]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Final Crisis&#39;&#39;===\nIn the 2008 miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, he is placed on the new Society&#39;s inner circle by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #1. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Sivana was with Libra when [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] was accused of sending computer codes that would help the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morrison, Grant]] (w), Various (a). &#39;&#39;Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #5 (2008). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sivana joins with [[Lex Luthor]] in betraying Libra, after being made to watch one of his own daughters succumb to the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. Sivana creates a device to shut down the Justifiers&#39; helmets, allowing Luthor to attack Libra.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Grant (2), Various (a). &#39;&#39;Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #6 (2008). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDoctor Sivana later shows up as a member of [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]&#39;s Secret Society of Super Villains.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #30. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC&#39;s continuity. In this new timeline, Doctor Sivana first appears in &#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #7, depicted as a respected scientist desperate to save his family from an unknown plight. With science having failed him, he turns to magic (specifically the legend of [[Black Adam]]).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #7. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Sivana&#39;s team finds what he believes to be the tomb of Black Adam; while attempting to open it, the scientist is half-blinded by magical lightning to the face (which has the side-effect of letting him see magic).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #9. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter Doctor Sivana&#39;s alliance with Black Adam fails, he heads to the Rock of Eternity where he can&#39;t get in because of a magical shield. He cries out for someone to help him save his family saying that while science has failed them, magic could save them. A voice is then heard saying it is indeed possible. The voice also says it has been watching him with the magic eating away his body but not his mind. Doctor Sivana asks for the voice&#39;s name and discovers a [[caterpillar]]-like creature trapped in a bottle. The creature claims that people call him Mister Mind and makes note that he and Doctor Sivana shall be the \&quot;best of friends.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceA\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #21. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced as a well-built man of average height, using his magic-seeing eye causes Doctor Sivana to slowly wither to a form resembling his stooped, traditional Fawcett appearance.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceA\&quot;/&gt;\n\nIn the fifth installment of the &#39;&#39;[[Multiversity]]&#39;&#39; series, &#39;&#39;Thunderworld&#39;&#39; (December 2014), Thaddeus Sivana of Earth-5 (a world populated by traditional interpretations of &#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; characters) coordinates with his doppelgangers from many of the 52 worlds of the Multiverse to defeat the Marvel Family of Earth-5 and, eventually, conquer the remaining [[DC Multiverse]]. He has his three offspring Thaddeus Jr, Georgia, and Magnificus storm the [[Marvel Family]]&#39;s [[Rock of Eternity]] and seize control of it, pitting themselves against their opponents, but soon finds he has been betrayed by the Legion of Sivanas and is defeated.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Multiversity&#39;&#39; 5: &#39;&#39;Thunderworld&#39;&#39; (December 2014). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The Legion continues to feature heavily in later chapters of &#39;&#39;The Multiversity&#39;&#39;. They invade Earth-42 and cull many of its heroes in &#39;&#39;Guidebook&#39;&#39;, and sell weapons sourced from alternate worlds to the Freedom Fighters of Earth-10 in &#39;&#39;Mastermen&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Guide to the Multiversity&#39;&#39;; &#39;&#39;The Multiversity - Mastermen&#39;&#39;. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Watchmen]]&#39;&#39; sequel &#39;&#39;[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]&#39;&#39;, Doctor Sivana is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by [[Riddler]] that talks about the Superman Theory. He is among the villains that do not want to relocate to [[Kahndaq]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Doomsday Clock&#39;&#39; #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSivana, now in an alliance with Mister Mind, is seen attending an appointment at a doctor&#39;s clinic. With Mister Mind inside his ear, Sivana, in possession of an encyclopedia of magical monsters, asks Mind about some of the various magical monsters named in the book. When he goes to see the doctor, Sivana attacks him and is ordered to cut out his tongue by Mister Mind, as it is vital for a spell.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #2 (January 2019). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn order for Black Adam to distract the Shazam Family while he and Doctor Sivana went to the Monsterlands to free the Monster Society of Evil, Mister Mind summoned the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]] who assist him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #8 (January 2020). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Mister Mind and Doctor Sivana head to the Monsterlands in order to build the Monster Society of Evil from its inhabitants. As King Kid fights the Shazam Family in Philadelphia, Doctor Sivana and Mister Mind are directed to a boat by [[Dummy (DC Comics)|Dummy]] who cannot accompany them since he cannot deal with water. When they arrive at the Dungeon of Eternity, Mister Mind states to Doctor Sivana that the inmates of the Dungeon of Eternity were gathered from all over the Magiclands and imprisoned for challenging the Council of Wizards. In addition, Mister Mind stated that the Monsterlands used to be called the Gods&#39; Realm until the day of Black Adam&#39;s betrayal which led them to strip the gods of their powers and close the doors to the Magiclands. They find a small prison containing [[Superboy-Prime]] in the Monsterlands as Superboy-Prime states that he can hear what Mister Mind is saying. Mister Mind and Doctor Sivana begin their plans to free the Monster Society of Evil from the Dungeon of Eternity.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #10 (January 2020). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Mister Mind senses the fight between the Shazam Family and Mamaragan as he instructs Doctor Sivana to stab his magical eye with a dagger that starts to melt the doors to the cells holding the Monster Society of Evil. Then Mister Mind started to control C.C., revealing to Billy that he is using him as a host and not Doctor Sivana. Mister Mind states to the Shazam Family that he plans to use C.C. to unite the Magiclands under his rule. He then proceeds to summon the Monster Society of Evil and Doctor Sivana to his side.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #11 (February 2020). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A flashback revealed that it took Mister Mind and Doctor Sivana a while to find C.C. Batson. In the present, Doctor Sivana uses his magical eye on Victor and Maria Vasquez in order to make sure that Mister Mind gets what he wants. When Tawky Tawny tries to help Shazam by attacking Doctor Sivana, Mister Mind in C.C. Batson&#39;s body turns him into a cub. Doctor Sivana is then instructed by Mister Mind to summon the Book of Champions from the Rock of Eternity. After Shazam casts the spell to unite the Seven Magiclands, Doctor Sivana sees that Shazam disappeared using a subtraxerim spell, unaware that it made him shrink to enter C.C.&#39;s head and confront Mister Mind.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #13 (July 2020). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; During the fight with the Shazam Family, Doctor Sivana and the Monster Society of Evil are knocked out when Shazam punches Mister Mind&#39;s talkbox. Doctor Sivana and the Monster Society of Evil were mentioned to have been remanded to Rock Falls Penitentiary where the Shazam Family built a special section to contain magical threats.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #14. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Powers &amp; abilities ==\nDoctor Sivana has genius-level intellect. In addition, he can see magic with his left eye.\nDoctor Sivana once discovered a mathematical formula which, when recited, allowed him to walk through walls and solid objects, making himself almost impossible to imprison or even catch. By the end of the Pre-Crisis stories, Captain Marvel supplies a material called Marvelium to create a prison cell that prevents that effect, thus containing Dr. Sivana.\n\n==Other versions==\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Superman: Red Son]]&#39;&#39;, Dr. Sivana briefly appears as a United States defector to Superman&#39;s Russia. In 1978, during Superman&#39;s birthday party, he had allied with [[Batman]] and [[Pyotr Roslov]] to defeat Superman. He had redesigned fireworks to show the [[Bat-Signal]] instead of Superman&#39;s chest symbol as a bait for Superman to find Batman.\n* In [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]]&#39;s 2007 limited series &#39;&#39;[[Monster Society of Evil#Shazam.21: The Monster Society of Evil .282007.29|Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil]]&#39;&#39;, Sivana is introduced in issue #2, as the new [[Attorney General of the United States]]. While ostensibly dedicated to stomping out terrorist threats, Sivana is more interested however in gaining technology from the invading alien Mr. Mind to develop into weapons, and to use the fear caused by Mind&#39;s Monster Society to start a new war he can profit from. He is eventually caught on live TV throwing [[Mary Marvel]] from the top of one of Mr Mind&#39;s war machines and is arrested.\n* Dr. Sivana made a cross-company cameo in [[Marvel Comics]]&#39; &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #335, in which he fights [[Captain America]] at a staged charity battle.\n* In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], this character was named \&quot;Dr. Silvana\&quot;.\n* Dr. Emil Gargunza, a major antagonist in &#39;&#39;Miracleman&#39;&#39; (n\u00e9 &#39;&#39;[[Marvelman]]&#39;&#39;), is based on Dr. Sivana. In [[Alan Moore]]&#39;s [[retcon]], Gargunza is a super-genius who elevated himself from childhood poverty through crime, then became a scientist. He created the Miracleman family at the behest of the British government with alien technology recovered from a crashed vessel. All of their [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] fights (including ones against Gargunza) were hallucinations induced by him to program their minds. Miracleman eventually acknowledges Gargunza as his \&quot;father\&quot;, then kills him.\n* Dr. Sivana also appears in &#39;&#39;[[Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!]]&#39;&#39; Mike Kunkle&#39;s design differs greatly from other versions: he&#39;s actually taller than Billy and Mary Batson.\n* Lex Luthor refers to Sivana in &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39; as the source of the mind-altering worms used to induce [[schizophrenia]] in Captain Marvel.\n* Sivana appears in issue 15 of the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; comic book, where he tries to rebuild [[Mister Atom]].\n* A &#39;Legion of Sivanas&#39; is introduced in &#39;&#39;[[The Multiversity]]: Thunderworld Adventures&#39;&#39; #1 (2014), as the Doctor Sivana of Earth-5 (patterned on classic &#39;&#39;Captain Marvel&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; stories) finds a way to connect with the other Sivanas of the Multiverse. Spotlighted doppelg\u00e4ngers include a [[super deformed]] Sivana (Earth-42), a snake Sivana ([[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!|Earth-26]]), vampire Sivana ([[Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain|Earth-43]]), etc. He is ultimately expelled from the legion and the [[Hannibal Lecter]]-esque Sivana takes over leadership. By the time of &#39;&#39;The Multiversity: Guidebook&#39;&#39; #1 (2015), the Hannibal-esque Sivana&#39;s league has mastered transportation between worlds and massacres the heroes of Earth-42 as part of a developing scheme to conquer all 52 worlds of \&quot;the local Multiverse\&quot;.\n* Daily superhero parody strip &#39;&#39;[[Brewster Rockit]]&#39;&#39; features a character based on Doctor Sivana.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In the &#39;&#39;[[Superman (1940s animated film series)|Superman]]&#39;&#39; cartoon &#39;&#39;[[The Magnetic Telescope]]&#39;&#39;, the astronomer (voiced by [[Bud Collyer]]) who built the titular device and as a result threatened the city strongly resembled Doctor Sivana.\n* Doctor Sivana was originally supposed to be featured in the third season of &#39;&#39;[[Super Friends]]&#39;&#39; as the leader of the [[Legion of Doom]]. However, due to [[Filmation]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]&#39;&#39; development at that time, Dr. Sivana was not permitted to appear in the show. He was eventually replaced with [[Lex Luthor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2011/07/super-70s-and-80s-super-friendsdarrell.html |title=Super &#39;70s and &#39;80s: \&quot;Super Friends\&quot; \u2013 Darrell McNeil, animator |author=Nobleman, Marc Tyler |date=29 July 2011 |publisher=Noblemania |access-date=25 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Doctor Sivana appears as a villain in &#39;&#39;[[Legends of the Superheroes]]&#39;&#39;, played by [[Howard Morris]].\n* Doctor Sivana appeared as a regular villain (occasionally with Sivana Jr. and Georgia) in the 1981 &#39;&#39;Shazam!&#39;&#39; part of &#39;&#39;[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]].\n* A person resembling Doctor Sivana (voiced by [[Scott Valentine (actor)|Scott Valentine]]) appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;[[Batgirl]] Returns\&quot;. He is the chemist that [[Catwoman]] and Batgirl interrogate at the Stacked Deck.\n* Doctor Sivana appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;The Power of Shazam!\&quot;, voiced by [[Jim Piddock]]. He, along with his children Thaddeus Sivana Jr. (also voiced by Jim Piddock) and Georgia (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) teamed up with [[Black Adam]] to steal Shazam&#39;s power from Captain Marvel. Sivana later betrays Adam and steals the power of the champion from him. [[Batman]] defeats him by tricking Sivana into saying \&quot;Shazam\&quot; to lose his powers allowing Captain Marvel to defeat him with a simple flick. Dr. Sivana returns in \&quot;The Malicious Mr. Mind!\&quot;. He is seen as a member of the [[Monster Society of Evil]] and he leads the team until [[Mister Mind]] takes over.\n\n===Film===\n====Animated====\n* An alternate universe version of Doctor Sivana appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Daniel Hagen]]. He is a member of Project Fair Play which also consisted of [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]], [[T. O. Morrow]], [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Michael Holt]], [[Mr. Freeze|Victor Fries]], [[Pat Dugan]], [[Professor Hamilton|Emil Hamilton]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Karen Beecher]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]], [[Silas Stone]], [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]], [[Stephen Shin]], and [[Will Magnus]]. After Victor Fries, Ray Palmer, and Silas Stone were killed, Thaddeus Sivana met with his fellow scientists at Karen Beecher&#39;s house. When the [[Metal Men]] attacked, Sivana was picked up by the Batdroid and was killed offscreen.\n* Doctor Sivana appears in the film &#39;&#39;[[Lego DC: Shazam!: Magic and Monsters]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. Here, while he does have plans for villainy, he is instead unwillingly mind-controlled by Mr. Mind to create a de-aging serum to turn the Justice League into kids, making them easier for the telepathic villain to control them for his plans.\n\n====Live-action====\nDr. Thaddeus Sivana appears in [[DC Comics|DC Films]]&#39; &#39;&#39;[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]&#39;&#39;, portrayed by [[Mark Strong]] as an adult and Ethan Pugiotto as a child. In this version, Thaddeus is alienated from his abusive father, the CEO of Sivana Industries, and his unsympathetic brother Sid which makes him an outcast and a black sheep of the family. During a car ride with them in 1974, he is whisked away to the Rock of Eternity by the wizard Shazam, who summons Thaddeus as part of his quest for a champion who is sufficiently pure of heart to be the vessel of his powers. Shazam rejects Sivana when he proves easily corrupted by the temptation of demons called the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]]. His abrupt return to his father&#39;s car results in a vehicular accident that renders his father a paraplegic, for which Sid blames him. After embarking on a lifelong quest to return to Shazam&#39;s lair, he succeeds in doing so decades later and steals the Eye of Sin, a talisman with which he can summon the Seven Sins to use his body as a vessel, granting him magical powers, which he promptly uses to murder his father and brother. This prompts Shazam to select 14-year-old Billy Batson as his new champion, leading to a confrontation between him and Sivana. When he and the Seven Deadly Sins fight Shazam and his now-powered foster siblings in the conflict, Doctor Sivana was defeated by Shazam and the Seven Deadly Sins are re-imprisoned. In the mid-credits, Doctor Sivana is in his cell at Rock Falls Penitentiary writing symbols on the walls until his pencil breaks. He is approached by Mister Mind who strikes an allegiance with him.\n\n===Video games===\n* Doctor Sivana is referenced in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold \u2013 The Videogame|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39;, when Batman and [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] are talking about [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]] and how similar the two villains look.\n* Doctor Sivana appears in &#39;&#39;[[DC Universe Online]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Matt Hislope]].\n* Doctor Sivana appears as a [[downloadable content]] [[playable character]] in &#39;&#39;[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]&#39;&#39;, who was part of the Shazam! Movie Pack, but has to be unlocked by completing the Shazam! Part 2 level. He is also the main boss of both the Shazam Part 1 and 2 levels. In level one, Billy Batson and Freddy Freeman have to escape him in a toy store inside a mall covered with Christmas decorations. In the second Shazam! Level, Billy Batson and his family have to defeat Doctor Sivana and Pride, Gluttony and Wrath in the Christmas fair.\n\n===Web series===\nAn alternate universe version of Doctor Sivana appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles]]&#39;&#39; (a companion to &#39;&#39;Justice League: Gods and Monsters&#39;&#39;), voiced by [[Daniel Hagen]].\n\n===Parody===\n* In the &#39;&#39;[[Mad (TV series)|MAD]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;World War ZZZ / Shazam! &amp; Cat\&quot;, Doctor Sivana appears in the segment \&quot;Shazam! &amp; Cat\&quot; (which is a crossover between Captain Marvel and &#39;&#39;[[Sam &amp; Cat]]&#39;&#39;).\n* Dr. Zveegee is an evil scientist who was first seen in &#39;&#39;[[Gumby]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110128135358/http://marvelfamily.com/whoswho/whoswho.aspx?castID=11 Doctor Sivana&#39;s \&quot;Who&#39;s Who\&quot; file] at The Marvel Family Web\n{{Shazam}}\n{{Golden Age of Comic Books}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{The Outsiders}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sivana}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1939]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional mad scientists]]\n[[Category:Golden Age supervillains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Parker (comics)]]\n[[Category:Characters created by C.
